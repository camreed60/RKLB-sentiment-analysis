Glad I found this sub - Want to make gains gradually ,Hi folks. Just want to say I appreciate the content of this sub as I have a very modest account and don’t have the risk tolerance of WSB. I lucked out with an RCAT call last month and did well with RKLB and LUNR calls which were bought in August. I want to continue with buying cheap and deep ITM calls and build gains gradually. I have no stomach for YOLO moves.

"Holding RKLB, wanting to add ACHR, and/or SOUN, and/or HITI. Thoughts?","Holding RKLB as a large part of my portfolio. Wanting to add another stock or two. ACHR SOUN and HITI stand out to me. Any holders of these companies in this sub that can chime in? For reference these positions will be much smaller than my RKLB position, but am getting to the point soon that I don't feel comfortable with such a big part of my portfolio being in one sector. So wanting to add 1-2 more with some cash I have on Monday, and put some future money into them. Wanting to hold long term 10+ years.

Did anyone see what happened to quantum computing stocks this week?,"I was browsing stocks on Robinhood last week and did a save search that I always use (down daily 20% stocks) and I saw QUBT and QBTS on there and I started doing some research on them. 

Recently, I have decided to move to long term positions and I have been very bullish on space stocks like LUNR and RKLB. I genuinely feel like space will be the fastest growing sector over the next decade. Anyway, I went home that night, watched a few videos on some cool stuff in quantum computing and said screw it, I’m long on quantum computing. It seriously will change our world dramatically when we inevitably figure it out. So I thought it was a deal and dumped a few grand into it. 

Since then, there’s been some pretty exciting stuff happen in the quantum computing world. Researchers have figured out how to control qubits and Amazon decided to invest $4B into their own quantum computer. D-Wave Quantum cracked a standardized binary encryption a few days ago too.

Anyway, they’re all up almost 100% since then and I decided I’m gonna stick around for the ride and go long on quantum. Quantum will expand our computing capabilities exponentially. And it’s probably sooner than we think.
