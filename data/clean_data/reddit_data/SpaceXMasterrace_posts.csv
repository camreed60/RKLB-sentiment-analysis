Help me like Rocket Lab (Again),"I used to love Rocket Lab.  But a few years ago, after they released the [Neutron Rocket | Development Update](https://youtu.be/7kwAPr5G6WA?si=biJa5Nz15EBQ_rDK&t=225) video of Peter Beck, which felt like him mocking what SpaceX was doing with their Starship Materials, it rubbed me wrong.   

Especially with him earlier that year eating his hat after openly saying they would never do reusable rockets.  For me I am so sick of the old space mocking and hearing what others can't do from rival companies, and I felt with Rocket Lab being a new company, they followed old space behaviors.

I want to see more of these smaller companies grow and be successful, but for some reason, Peter Beck still rubs me wrong.

So, tell me why my thought process is wrong and help me like Rocket Lab.

Appreciation for the Rest of the Industry,"EDIT: I meant to post this is r/spacexlounge, not here. I’m leaving the post up because deleting posts is for cowards.




We all love SpaceX, they've done incredible things for the space industry and have set the pace for the next generation of spaceflight. No company has been able to excite people about spaceflight, or broken from convention, nearly as much as SpaceX has in the last 5-10 years. As a result of this, communities like this one are some of the most enthusiastic, vibrant groups of space enthusiasts out there. As such, I've been a little disappointed with the sheer amount of negativity I've seen from SpaceX fans about other launch providers. I believe that being cynical about any part of rocketry is cheating yourself. I wanted to take a bit of time to gush about them and give them their due credit. 

I worry that in this quasi-tribalist situation we find ourselves in, we lose sight of how fucking impressive rocketry is. Every single vehicle that is capable of spaceflight is an engineering masterpiece, each with unique design considerations that result in hundreds, if not thousands, of brilliant innovation. There is nothing routine about spaceflight. I’m gonna go company by company and highlight aspects of each that I find impressive and defend what I consider undeserved attacks against them.

**United Launch Alliance**

The venerable ULA has become somewhat of a poster child for the mainstream, old, space industry. Amongst other things, their heavy use of heritage hardware has made them fairly unexciting. 

However, they are an incredibly impressive company. They are the *only* launch provider in the world who can boast a 100% success rate. While lengthy, their assembly and integration system is a marvel to behold. As for heritage equipment, it’s important to keep in mind that a lot of tech in the space industry does not rapidly change, and the old equipment that is kept in use is often kept due to being incredibly reliable.

As for rocket technology, the RL-10 engine makes the Centaur upper stage and Delta IV heavy upper stages are *still* the best god damned upper-stages in history-they blow the Falcon Upper stage out of the water. They’re such high-performance engines, in fact, that despite the Falcon 9’s and Falcon Heavy’s far superior first stages, the Atlas V and Delta IV Heavy *still* reign supreme in the high energy orbit market.

There is a reason ULA is still hired for so many launches, despite SpaceX’s apparent superiority in all respects. At this point, I want to mention something I think is often lost in these discussions. Stat sheets we find online rarely reflect the real world. On paper, the Falcon Heavy blows the Delta IV Heavy out of the water in every conceivable way. But what is missed is Falcon is designed to be a “LEO Chucker” with its high energy, aggressive gravity turn in atmo, Delta IV was made to put heavy payloads in high orbits like GEO. And since it’s central purpose is launching heavy recon satellites for the DoD, money is really not a concern. In fact, I count the high price tag as a win, as that is anywhere from $250 to $500 million per launch of military money going to support spaceflight. In addition, ULA’s performance/cost gap between Atlas and Delta will be largely filled by Vulcan-Centaur.

Space programs are insanely expensive, and at the end of the day the $30 million give or take savings of using SpaceX rockets is often not as dominating a concern as we make it out to be. There are a thousand factors that go into selecting a launch service. 

And one has to remember the one and only Space Cowboy Tory Bruno, the definition of a Steely-eyed Missile Man.

**Blue Origin**

Jeff Who? While Elon’s joke was topical at the time, with Blue Origin’s near absence of a presence in popular space media, Blue is on track to become SpaceX’s #1 competitor. Here’s why:

They’ve been around since 2000-- a full 2 years *before* SpaceX, and are funded completely out of pocket by the richest man alive. So where have they been? They’ve been working. The company’s motto is “gradatim ferociter” or: “step by step, ferociously.” Which is my personal favorite ever motto. 

For most of its history the company has been very small, but with very big dreams. Their first project, New Shepard, a fully reusable vehicle intended for space tourism, successfully performed an autonomous landing after a sub-orbital spaceflight in November 2015, narrowly beating SpaceX as the first of its kind. Now they’ve got a bigger project: New Glenn.

New Glenn is a monster - a LEO chucker rivaling Falcon Heavy with a gargantuan reusable first stage that will propulsively land on a moving ship. In addition, it’s 7-meter fairing allows for the largest ever cargo volume. It’s been in development for a while and is still more than a year away from its maiden launch. But it is very, very real. Keep in mind the company’s motto. Blue is not afraid to take their time and will launch when they’re ready. In the meantime, they have been building a massive system of infrastructure, an assembly-line rocket factory has already been erected and their launch facility is nearing completion. They aim for at least one launch a month and are dead set on being capable of that before kicking off production.

The last few years have been huge for Blue, Bezos had spent a total of $500 million on the company from 2000 to 2015. Today, they’re spending billions every year, with Bezos continually increasing funding. In the past 3 years, they’ve gone from around 600 employees to 3,000. Before dismissing Blue for their apparent lack of action, keep in mind who’s funding it. Bezos couldn't care less about spectacle or optics, as opposed to Elon's wide public appeal. A chief reason for this is that SpaceX is funded primarily by investors, while Blue is all out of Jeff’s pocket. This is the man who built Amazon from the ground up for decades, keeping it in the red as he slowly built up the infrastructure before suddenly dominating the market. 

**Boeing**

Boeing has some serious management issues that have greatly hindered the company, but this should not be taken out on their projects. They employ - and take great care of, mind you - some of the best engineers on the planet.

**Starliner**

Starliner was built from scratch to be the first-ever reusable crewed spacecraft (Shuttle was refurbishable). While Crew Dragon is intended for crewed use only once, Starliner is designed for up to 10 reuses. It’s nowhere near as exciting looking as Dragon, but do not discount the technical marvel that it is. As for cost per seat, its as expensive as the Soyuz was, but NASA doesn't make profits - they receive the money they need to keep the ISS crewed regardless. The primary goal of ComCrew was for the money spent to be spent in the American Aerospace ecosystem.

**SLS**

SLS is a jobs program, that much is known. But so is most of the space industry in some way or another. The government pumps billions into aerospace to maintain the industrial base so that the US always has a large pool of talented, experienced aerospace experts, and large scale manufacturing capability. The equipment for making rocket parts is often more expensive than all the parts they produce in their lifetime. This is the chief explanation for the massive RS-25 contract awarded to Aerojet-Rocketdyne earlier this year. Don’t think of all these billions as being wasted, think of them as dollars that would have otherwise gone to making weapons being used to support our aerospace industry. Money to Boeing for example trickles down to their hundreds of subcontractors. Aerojet’s R&D will surely benefit greatly from this contract.

(despite its crazy price tag, the RS-25 is probably STILL the best rocket engine ever made)

Why is SLS so expensive? It’s not as straightforward as may think. First, Boeing takes as much government money as they can, though we all knew that. Second, Congress does NOT KNOW HOW BUDGETS WORK. NASA has a yearly budget request, and each program requests the amount of money they need for that year. You almost always need more money in the specific years of a project than you do later- hiring, buying materials, building infrastructure, etc., but Congress likes flat budgets.

This means NASA and Boeing can't afford to design, build, and test the entire Orion and SLS all at once. It’s had to be phased out and staggered over 15+ years. By a huge margin, the #1 cost is always paying people. The cost of building rockets is cheap compared to this. Thus, the more you build, the cheaper each one is. Every additional year means another year’s salary to the thousands of incredibly talented people working on SLS. THIS is why SLS is supposedly over a billion dollars per launch. It does NOT cost anywhere near that much to build, but the salaries of so many people for so long has created a massive development cost. But keep in mind: NASA is not a company, and does not care about profit. This is a problem that has plagued NASA since its inception and is the main reason the Commercial Crew Program exists.

The beauty of NASA is that they can front the bill for developing this kind of stuff, that can then be used by the public.

And if you’ll forgive me for praising SLS/Orion, Orion is a masterpiece, it's the most capable and advanced spacecraft ever. And building a rocket with capabilities like SLS is no small feat. Total costs of SLS/Orion are upwards of $30 billion at this point, and many have scoffed at the “cost-saving” of using old shuttle parts. However, Project Apollo, in today’s money, cost $283 billion in today’s money, as they built the program from scratch. We stand on the shoulders of giants, and every day we come closer to establishing a deep space presence. This can not and will not be done by SpaceX alone.

**NASA**

SpaceX owes a great debt to NASA, and not just for the billions in contracts they’ve received from the agency. They wouldn’t be anywhere near where they are today. We all have great dreams for Starship, but there is no way it will ever become human-rated, or live up to its promise, without their help and support. NASA’s goals are pure, and for every egregious political obstacle we bemoan, remember that they’re the ones who have to navigate them.

**The Industry of the Next Generation**

And of course, there has been an explosion of smaller space companies. Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and Virgin Orbit are making strides in space tourism and small payload services. Rocket Lab’s Electron Rocket is providing the cheapest ever launch services for small payloads. Every year they’re being joined by newcomers like Firefly and Masten. 

I didn’t mean to go after anyone, and i’m sorry if I got carried away. Spaceflight is my #1 passion, and it has always irked me to see people callously dismissing some of the greatest engineering accomplishments of our time because they don’t land themselves, or don’t benefit from a bombastic public figure like Elon. This is the most exciting time for spaceflight since 1969, and we have the privilege to see the birth of a new era. Taking the next great leap, becoming a species of space travelers, will for a certainty take far longer than we expect. But when we do finally take it, it will be a combined effort by everyone I’ve mentioned and more.
