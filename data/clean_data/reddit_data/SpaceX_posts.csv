How useful would a Mega-helicopter be to the spaceflight industry.,"Spacex has recently landed its first-stage using solely its merlin engines for all the phases of the landing. It has also been rumored (or stated I can't say for sure) that it intents to recover their payload fairings via parachute and helicopter. On top of that they're still looking at ways to recover the second stage. 

Getting that second stage back on land with such a strong thrust to weight ratio while enduring the fierce reentry seems almost impossible. But what if we could skip the landing burn and have the second stage use all its leftover fuel during the deorbit and reentry burn. Being much lighter, it will heat less during reentry and will quickly slow down with the airflow. You open up a supersonic drag chute plus parachute and finally you grab it with the yet-to-be-built megacopter and gently dispose of it on an ASDS which has arms to grab the stage and therefore requires no landing leg.

My assumption is if that yet-to-be-built megacopter suddenly appears tomorrow it would have a tremendous effect on spaceflight industry. If that helicopter can recover something the size of the F9 second stage it could also recover a firefly alpha first stage or an Electron (rocket lab) or launcher one first stage and even anything which is in the mass range of 20 tons and can reliably do the first half of the journey back to land (boostback/deorbit burn and reentry burn while surving reentry.

I consider the landing burn to be insanely much harder to execute than the other two burns. It requires extreme precision, little margin for error and is the most fuel-inefficient as it requires the most throttling actions. A rocket equipped for a landing burn will always require a huge number of sub-scaled engine to have a low enough TWR.

So if this yet-to-be-built helicopter existed how hard would it be to make the parachute system capable of slowing the core to about 100-150 km/h ?

Building a helicopter capable of recovering a  20t metal bar zooming at 150 km/h downward is possible IMO. Such a helicopter could be able to lift (not slow down) more than 50 tons. It has not been done simply because until recently it didn't have any use to anyone. The military don't need such an oversize helo that would certainly consumes shitload of kerozine for little use and autonomy.

However a mega-helicopter designed to recover a rocket from the sky wouldn't bother itself with fuel-efficiency and autonomy more than is needed and would be power-focused. It would carry no humans onboard and fly above the unhabited ocean  easing the task to get flight certification from the FAA. 

The most powerful helicopter flying today is the russian Mi-26 capable of lifting 20 tons or ... an american Chinook (see the famous photo). The yet-to-be-built megacopter needs to carry two and a half times more while being much more agile.

The agility can be achieved by the lack of life support requirements onboard for humans therefore dedicating the entire fuselage to the mission. In terms of power, history has showed us that with helicopter it seems to be possible to just, in the most straightforward manner, scale things up. The Mi-26 is just a normal helicopter design with 2 insanely powerful turboshafts (12000 hp each). Such powerful turboshaft are common nowadays they equip most large airliners (a turbofan is driven by a turbojet which can be quite easily converted to turboshaft). The most powerful helicopter ever flown was the russian V-12 capable of carrying 40 tons which used 4 turboshaft of 1960's design. The V-12 itself first flown in 1968 the year of the moon landing.

I have the intuition that helicopter technologies have not much evolved since the 70's and that it could have huge applications for spaceflight if we could scale up the power just like the 747 scaled up the power for aircraft and opened new industries (mass tourism for this case).

I want to know your thought about it and how hard would it be to catch a 20 tons rocket core zooming from space and what would be the requirement in terms of parformance of such a megacopter.

Possibility of the return of the Falcon 1?,"The Falcon 1 was a rocket built to launch small payload satellites (up to 430 kg to SSO). SpaceX had a lot of interest in such a rocket when they announced it in the early aughts and in fact had payloads on their first three launches. But by the time they got the fourth launch done and proved a working system the potential customers never materialized. There was only one more launch of the Falcon 1 and then the company moved on to the Falcon 9 and Dragon. 

Now, there are new companies, such as FireFly Space Systems and Rocket Lab, that are building rockets that appear to be smaller versions of the Falcon 1. Rocket Lab's Electron Rocket is designed to carry 150kg to SSO and FireFly Alpha is designed to carry 200kg to SSO. The FireFly B will take 400 kg to LEO which puts it just behind the Falcon 1 in performance.

If the small payload market takes off do you think its possible that SpaceX will dust off the Falcon 1 design? Of course they will update it with the advancements learned from the F9 FT. An update Falcon 1 could be a Merlin 1D and Merlin 1D vac with both engines throttled down to conserve fuel or a scaled down Merlin. (The Meth/Lox aerospike engine for the Firefly B will have a higher Isp though.) The Falcon 1 was already delivering more then twice the payload of these rockets at $8.5 million in 2009. Electron Rocket will cost $4.9 million which will make the Falcon 1 cheaper per kilogram. 

If the market for low mass payloads into space expands greatly to accommodate the number of new companies will SpaceX reenter that market? On one hand they can probably produce a superior rocket in that price range but on the other hand its not really an advancement toward Mars like further F9 and FH development.",34,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/4kahq2/possibility_of_the_return_of_the_falcon_1/,possibility of the return of the falcon 1,the falcon 1 was a rocket built to launch small payload satellites up to 430 kg to sso spacex had a lot of interest in such a rocket when they announced it in the early aughts and in fact had payloads on their first three launches but by the time they got the fourth launch done and proved a working system the potential customers never materialized there was only one more launch of the falcon 1 and then the company moved on to the falcon 9 and dragon now there are new companies such as firefly space systems and rocket lab that are building rockets that appear to be smaller versions of the falcon 1 rocket labs electron rocket is designed to carry 150kg to sso and firefly alpha is designed to carry 200kg to sso the firefly b will take 400 kg to leo which puts it just behind the falcon 1 in performance if the small payload market takes off do you think its possible that spacex will dust off the falcon 1 design of course they will update it with the advancements learned from the f9 ft an update falcon 1 could be a merlin 1d and merlin 1d vac with both engines throttled down to conserve fuel or a scaled down merlin the methlox aerospike engine for the firefly b will have a higher isp though the falcon 1 was already delivering more then twice the payload of these rockets at 85 million in 2009 electron rocket will cost 49 million which will make the falcon 1 cheaper per kilogram if the market for low mass payloads into space expands greatly to accommodate the number of new companies will spacex reenter that market on one hand they can probably produce a superior rocket in that price range but on the other hand its not really an advancement toward mars like further f9 and fh development
