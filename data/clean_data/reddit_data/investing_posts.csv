What is your thought on my portfolio and strategy?,"I'm 30M. I recently started investing in ETF & individual stocks. Below is my portfolio I figured it out myself, but I am not sure if it is reasonable in the long run, and I want to hear other people's opinions, comments, and criticism on it. I put in a lump sum (a large amount of my saving money after I excluded emergency money) and plan to DCA monthly.

**ETF 75%**  
\- iShares Core MSCI World (Acc) - IWDA

**Individual stocks 25%**  
\- **Tech Growth 12%:** Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Palantir, Nvidia, Tesla  
\- **(High-)dividend 5%:** Siemens, Merck & Co, Swiss Re, Exxon Mobil, McDonald  
\- **Consumer defensive 3%:** UnitedHealth, Mastercard, Cola  
\- **Personal favorite 3.5%:** Garmin, Air Product and Chemicals, Walmart, Rolls-Royce, Airbus  
\- **Aerospace & Defensive 1.5%**: Rocket Lab, Howmet, RTX Corp

The reason that my portfolio contains more than 20 stocks is that I want to diversify it in terms of the stocks, not types of assets. 

My concerns/questions are:

1. I'm not sure if I hold too many stocks in the same category (e.g. tech stocks) and most of them are already covered by the IWDA ETF.
2. I'm also considering holding only 1 or 2 high-dividend stocks like AbbVie, instead of 5 dividend stocks. Is it a good idea?
3. My long-term plan follows ""time in the market > timing the market"". So I plan to split DCA in half and put in ETF and stocks equally. I also read about the [Enhanced DCA](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b40399/enhanced_dollar_cost_averaging/). Statistically, is the Enhanced DCA worth a try?

All suggestions are welcome.

Just looking for some suggestions on next steps,"First off this market is crazy but I’m loving it. 
I know what goes up must come down. 
Between PLTR, LUNR, ASTS, KULR, RKLB, and RCAT I’m up over $100k in the last couple months (except PLTR which I’ve had since last year). 
I’m not used to trading this much and mostly have been just following all the Reddit chats and looking up the companies and making decisions and feel like I’ve gotten lucky but know the market is super atypical right now also. 
$100k is about 2.8% of my total investments.
What would you do if you were in my shoes? Just keep sticking it all out with all of them? Offload some of the penny stocks only?  Just looking for what you’d do in this scenario. Most of it’s in a Roth IRA and Pretax 401k.

My investment portfolio hits 75% paper gain. Time to sell everything and run? ,"Been investing since April 2020 when Covid hit. Biggest paper gain so far from my current holding is from AAPL, NVDA, PLTR, CRWD and RKLB. 75% paper gain obviously is pretty good to me and it’s at all time high. Lately super green market is partly due to the favorable result of election, slightly better than expected market condition and expectation of soft landing. But Correction is imminent, mid-December or bull market keeps going until February or late March when big player adjusts their portfolio? Things can’t go up forever. Wondering if I should cash out everything and buy back in after correction.

Did anyone see what happened to quantum computing stocks this week?,"I was browsing stocks on Robinhood last week and did a save search that I always use (down daily 20% stocks) and I saw QUBT and QBTS on there and I started doing some research on them. 

Recently, I have decided to move to long term positions and I have been very bullish on space stocks like LUNR and RKLB. I genuinely feel like space will be the fastest growing sector over the next decade. Anyway, I went home that night, watched a few videos on some cool stuff in quantum computing and said screw it, I’m long on quantum computing. It seriously will change our world dramatically when we inevitably figure it out. So I thought it was a deal and dumped a few grand into it. 

Since then, there’s been some pretty exciting stuff happen in the quantum computing world. Researchers have figured out how to control qubits and Amazon decided to invest $4B into their own quantum computer. D-Wave Quantum cracked a standardized binary encryption a few days ago too.

Anyway, they’re all up almost 100% since then and I decided I’m gonna stick around for the ride and go long on quantum. Quantum will expand our computing capabilities exponentially. And it’s probably sooner than we think.

QUBT - 200 shares
RGTI - 500 shares
QBTS - 425 shares
