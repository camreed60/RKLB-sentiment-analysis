"Overvalued Companies (PLTR, SHOP, CRWD)","
The market right now is filled with young companies reaching impressive highs and earning steep valuations. Each has its own story, and for investors, the challenge is finding the next Mag 7 or something close to it. 

I’m curious to hear your thoughts on which of these companies might have what it takes to rise to the top and why. Some examples I’m considering are PLTR, SHOP, CRWD, APP, RKLB, and a few others. I wasn’t around during the early days of Amazon, Apple, and similar companies, but I imagine they also went through cycles of intense enthusiasm, stock price spikes, and corrections.

How Long Will You Keep DCA?,"Let's say you are doing DCA for stocks you have high convictions, such as NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, PLTR or RKLB.

And you are doing, say $200 per month or perhaps $500 every quarter (more or less, depending on your financial situations) per stock.

1) At what stage of the stock's life would you then decide to stop DCA? Especially for stocks like MSFT and AAPL that have been around for a long while?

2) Also, while you DCA, would you also sell your initial amount you bought? Or you'd let it ride?

3) What stocks are you guys DCA now?

Name a large-cap stock and its small-cap competitor ,"I am always looking for small/mid-cap companies that have a similar business model or product as large cap competitors! 

I’ll start by naming a few (large-cap and small-cap) companies: 

- CRWD and S
- COST and BJ
- KR and SFM
- CMG and CAVA 
- MNST and CELH
- SBUX and BROS 
- Space X and RKLB (count it) 

I always love seeing the small caps slowly take a piece of the pie from the big boys. It’s what capitalism is all about. Especially fun to see when the little guy has a better product. I think this is the case for almost all of the companies I listed. If they aren’t flat out better, they offer something slightly different, or are better in a certain way. 

These smaller cap stocks are obviously a bigger risk, since a lot of them still are not making money, but the growth is very appealing. 

Would love to hear some comparisons like this and an explanation as to why you think the smaller company is better, or will continue to grow. 

Appreciate any responses! The stock market is a wonderful place for some competition.

What do we think about IOVA?,"Firstly congrats everyone on RKLB, ACHR and LUNR gains. It was fun ride, I have to be honest I had jumped off the wagon a bit earlier but hat off to all of you that mooned! 

Also for some of you that jumped on ZETA, enjoy the good days that await. 

But let’s talk about IOVA…:

Another biopharma stock trying to solve the issues of cancer. An industry that is a Holy Grail for all pump and dumpers out here. 

But is this one different? To be honest I do not know, but that is why I am posting this. To hear other sides, other points of view. 

IOVA is currently sitting around $9. These are levels of before the this year run to $16 (what goes up must come down, when pumped and dumped). However… this company reported revenues, 90.86mil revenue to be precise. Granted, not enough to support current market cap but bear in mind it is bio industry we talk about. It takes 1 approval and it is too late.

Leadership:
CEO is there since 2016, seems like an experienced guy. Was contributor to many oncology drugs already developed and approved.

Others seem legit as well, this post is already too long… feel free to research yourself.

They also own a bit less than 12% so there is certain commitment there.  And of course the vanguard, black rock etc. are heavily involved as well. More than 87% is owned by institutions. 

Amtagvi product got approved by FDA and that is now generating certain revenue. They plan tk get approval in Canada, Europe and UK as well. 

They also work on LN-145, IOV-4001 and IOV-3001 but let’s be honest these are long shots and nothing guarantee success of these.

I know these are speculations and putting some numbers from the future is no way to go but I feel like I have to just to make this post a bit more complete.

Potential yearly revenue if approved broader and if nothing goes wrong  is 12billion (amount of people with cancer of specific type * cost of treatment) but realistic values at beginning is 1-2bill per year or even less. 

And then for all the gamblers time that with moon if other drugs get approved as well. 

Company with 90mil revenue and 80 million of debt with 2,8 billion market cap and 440 million of operating expenses. Company with future (on the moon or in the sand). Do you hate IOVA or you will become a bag holder?

Is anyone else a little concerned about this market jump up?,"Listen, I get that it seems like clear skies and rainbows, and I’m not really a “bearish” type investor, but sometimes I find it good practice to sit back for a moment and just reevaluate the current situation we’re in.

I’ll give an example that pertains to me. I’m currently invested in Sofi, PLTR, and RKLB, so this has been an incredible year for me. But looking back, it’s starting to really feel like total and utter exuberance again like 2021. YouTube videos and subreddits have been saying over and over how this is only the beginning and we’re going to be at 500 next year. That’s exactly the type of shit that was said in 2021 right before every small cap stock tanked like 70%. 

I’m not saying it’s a time to sell, I would personally prescribe to the “it’s time to slow down on how much I invest” currently. Buying RKlb at 27$ or PLTR at 66$ is not the same opportunity as in the 4-7$ range as it used to be. It seems very difficult to find any good deals, considering literally almost every sector in the stock market is just going up vertically. And just remember, just it is a great company doesn’t always mean it’s currently a good price to buy it. Sometimes it’s good to take the foot off the breaks when stocks going up 300%+ in one year.

But hey what do I know. Just be careful out there folks, and don’t get sucked too hard into the FOMO. Be fearful when everyone else is greedy and all that jazz.",556,457,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h49py3/is_anyone_else_a_little_concerned_about_this/,is anyone else a little concerned about this market jump up,listen i get that it seems like clear skies and rainbows and im not really a bearish type investor but sometimes i find it good practice to sit back for a moment and just reevaluate the current situation were in ill give an example that pertains to me im currently invested in sofi pltr and rklb so this has been an incredible year for me but looking back its starting to really feel like total and utter exuberance again like 2021 youtube videos and subreddits have been saying over and over how this is only the beginning and were going to be at 500 next year thats exactly the type of shit that was said in 2021 right before every small cap stock tanked like 70 im not saying its a time to sell i would personally prescribe to the its time to slow down on how much i invest currently buying rklb at 27 or pltr at 66 is not the same opportunity as in the 47 range as it used to be it seems very difficult to find any good deals considering literally almost every sector in the stock market is just going up vertically and just remember just it is a great company doesnt always mean its currently a good price to buy it sometimes its good to take the foot off the breaks when stocks going up 300 in one year but hey what do i know just be careful out there folks and dont get sucked too hard into the fomo be fearful when everyone else is greedy and all that jazz
How we feeling about RKLB,"Pretty significant climb over the last few weeks. 305% YTD. Solid sales at $105 million. A couple rocket launches and it’s looking like we’re getting a Neutron launch in 2025.  

Right now the price is floating around $25/share. Pretty big jump fairly quickly, leaning towards “overbought”. Not sure if we should expect the price to climb any higher in the following weeks or if it’ll balance out around $20/share. But I feel pretty confident in this company and expect solid growth in the years to come.

MDA Space blowing up by year’s end (contract incoming),"All this hype with RKLB, LUNR, and RDW and no-one is mentioning MDA (mktcap - 3.2b CAD). Yeah I know it mainly trades on Toronto but just get a broker that supports Toronto, eg IBKR. They’re planning to list on US soon but by then it will probably already have taken off...

Their earnings report was stellar: growth of 38% yoy, it is actually **PROFITABLE** \- none of the other space companies are profitable - profitability with adjusted EBITDA of $55.5 million, up 30% YoY, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.7%, net income up 60% yoy, and net debt adjusted EBITDA ratio of just 0.8x (so zero risk of dilution). However, post earnings the stock was mostly flat. Why? Their reported backlog was unchanged from previous quarter report (backlog is 4.6B btw).

But if any of you folks had bothered to tune in to the call, you would have heard the CEO say that it is a fact that by year end they will be **definitely be signing a new contract worth 750M** – of these, only 300M is recorded in backlog – a**n additional $450M is going to be added** upon finalization and t**his will happen by year’s end.** They in fact stated during the Q&A that they are confident they will be finishing 2024 with $5B backlog. They also said MDA’s satellite systems division alone has a $**15B+ pipeline** of potential projects, thanks to its Aurora-class satellites tailored for low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations.

Still not convinced? Consider:

\> MDA is building a new 185,000 sq. ft. facility in Quebec, **capable of producing two satellites per day** starting in late 2025.

\>Planet labs is currently generating about 200million in revenue per year. MDA’s geointelligence segment is also generating about 200million in revenue per year. However, MDA’s geo segment represents **only about 20%** of MDA’s total revenue. PL’s marketcap is currently almost **1B**. MDA is 3.1 CAD = **2.2B USD**. Oh, and PL is currently operating at a loss (though that might change next report) but MDA is running a profit. Based on this fact alone, MDA’s mkt cap should be at least double than what it is.

Thoughts and dilemma on Rocket Lab? ,"I went into Rocket Lab back in July with the intention of making it my primary long-term growth stock and since then have managed to acquire 440 shares at average price of around $9.  

My intention was/is to keep buying and hold the stock for many many years, because I truly believe in the company potential and the overall space industry and I believe that it will be a key growth sector for the next decade and beyond regardless of who is in power in the US. (I am not american btw)

Just before the election I was in profit in the low thousands, which was nice but since the election I am now sitting at a profit of 147%, which is my best position in my investing ""career"" so far. 

Like I said, I believe the company will do well regardless of who is in power. However, given the fast rise since the election I am expecting correction happening soon. 

And my dilemma is: should exit now and take the profits and then go back in after the correction? Or should I just hold until the potential correction and start buying more then? 

What would you do in my situation?",148,188,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gx7ofy/thoughts_and_dilemma_on_rocket_lab/,thoughts and dilemma on rocket lab,i went into rocket lab back in july with the intention of making it my primary longterm growth stock and since then have managed to acquire 440 shares at average price of around 9 my intention wasis to keep buying and hold the stock for many many years because i truly believe in the company potential and the overall space industry and i believe that it will be a key growth sector for the next decade and beyond regardless of who is in power in the us i am not american btw just before the election i was in profit in the low thousands which was nice but since the election i am now sitting at a profit of 147 which is my best position in my investing career so far like i said i believe the company will do well regardless of who is in power however given the fast rise since the election i am expecting correction happening soon and my dilemma is should exit now and take the profits and then go back in after the correction or should i just hold until the potential correction and start buying more then what would you do in my situation
"Rocket Lab Announces Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results, Posts 55% Year-on-Year Growth and Guides to Record Revenue in Q4","[https://investors.rocketlabusa.com/news/news-details/2024/Rocket-Lab-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results-Posts-55-Year-on-Year-Growth-and-Guides-to-Record-Revenue-in-Q4/](https://investors.rocketlabusa.com/news/news-details/2024/Rocket-Lab-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results-Posts-55-Year-on-Year-Growth-and-Guides-to-Record-Revenue-in-Q4/)

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: “In the third quarter 2024 we once again executed against our end-to-end space strategy with successes and key achievements reached across small and medium launch, as well as space systems. Revenue grew 55% year-on-year to $105 million and we continue to see strong demand growth with our backlog at $1.05 billion. Significant achievements for the quarter included signing a launch service agreement for multiple launches on Neutron with a confidential commercial satellite constellation customer; successfully launching twelve Electron launches year-to-date, making 2024 a record year for launches with more still to come; signing $55 million in new Electron launches, further cementing Electron’s position as a global launch leader; and being selected by NASA to complete a study contract for a proposal to retrieve samples from Mars and return them to Earth as part of a world-first mission. We expect to close out the year strongly with more Electron launches scheduled in November and December, alongside continued progress across Neutron and space systems, that is behind our guidance for a record $125-$135 million revenue quarter in Q4.”

**Business Highlights for the Third Quarter 2024, plus updates since September 30, 2024.**

**Electron:**

* Achieved a new annual launch record of 12 Electron launches to date, with more scheduled across November and December 2024. Electron is the world’s third most-frequently launched rocket annually by vehicle type and remains the United States’ second most-frequently launched rocket annually.
* Signed several new Electron launch contracts in Q3 2024 with a total value of $55m, demonstrating an increased average selling price of $8.4m and showcasing a 67% pricing increase since the rocket’s debut launch.
* Successful Electron launches for three separate commercial satellite constellation operators in Q3, including two missions launched within just eight days. In addition to these, Electron’s most recent mission, launched in the fourth quarter on November 5 ^(th) , 2024, included an expedited turnaround of just 10 weeks between contract signing and launch.

**Neutron:**

* Signed a launch service agreement for multiple launches on Neutron with a confidential commercial satellite constellation operator that signifies the beginning of a productive collaboration that could see Neutron deploy the entire constellation.
* Announced a federal defense contract that supports Neutron and the development of its Archimedes engine with the U.S. Air Force’s Research Laboratory.
* Doubled engine testing cadence for Archimedes over the quarter at Rocket Lab’s engine test site in Mississippi, alongside strong production execution at the Company’s Engine Development Complex in California which included multiple engines manufactured, assembled, and shipped for engine testing.
* Significant progress made across Neutron’s structures and infrastructure, including the completion of construction on the rocket’s Assembly, Integration, and Test (A.I.T.) facility in Virginia.
* Well-positioned to on-ramp to the U.S. Space Force’s National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Lane 1 program, which began accepting proposals in November 2024 to on-ramp new launch providers to an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract valued at $5.6 billion over a five-year period.

**Space Systems:**

* Completed production and delivery of two spacecraft on time and on budget for NASA’s ESCAPADE mission to Mars.
* Selected by NASA to complete a study contract for a proposal to retrieve samples from Mars and return them to Earth, a first-of-its-kind mission.
* Completed two new spacecraft for Varda Space Industries to conduct the 2 ^(nd) and 3 ^(rd) missions to return in-space manufacturing capsules to Earth.
* Executed on schedule against the Company’s $515 million prime contract with the Space Development Agency to build 18 spacecraft for its Tranche 2 Transport Layer program.",344,106,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gpvw9b/rocket_lab_announces_third_quarter_2024_financial/,rocket lab announces third quarter 2024 financial results posts 55 yearonyear growth and guides to record revenue in q4,httpsinvestorsrocketlabusacomnewsnewsdetails2024rocketlabannouncesthirdquarter2024financialresultsposts55yearonyeargrowthandguidestorecordrevenueinq4httpsinvestorsrocketlabusacomnewsnewsdetails2024rocketlabannouncesthirdquarter2024financialresultsposts55yearonyeargrowthandguidestorecordrevenueinq4 rocket lab founder and ceo sir peter beck said in the third quarter 2024 we once again executed against our endtoend space strategy with successes and key achievements reached across small and medium launch as well as space systems revenue grew 55 yearonyear to 105 million and we continue to see strong demand growth with our backlog at 105 billion significant achievements for the quarter included signing a launch service agreement for multiple launches on neutron with a confidential commercial satellite constellation customer successfully launching twelve electron launches yeartodate making 2024 a record year for launches with more still to come signing 55 million in new electron launches further cementing electrons position as a global launch leader and being selected by nasa to complete a study contract for a proposal to retrieve samples from mars and return them to earth as part of a worldfirst mission we expect to close out the year strongly with more electron launches scheduled in november and december alongside continued progress across neutron and space systems that is behind our guidance for a record 125135 million revenue quarter in q4 business highlights for the third quarter 2024 plus updates since september 30 2024 electron achieved a new annual launch record of 12 electron launches to date with more scheduled across november and december 2024 electron is the worlds third mostfrequently launched rocket annually by vehicle type and remains the united states second mostfrequently launched rocket annually signed several new electron launch contracts in q3 2024 with a total value of 55m demonstrating an increased average selling price of 84m and showcasing a 67 pricing increase since the rockets debut launch successful electron launches for three separate commercial satellite constellation operators in q3 including two missions launched within just eight days in addition to these electrons most recent mission launched in the fourth quarter on november 5 th 2024 included an expedited turnaround of just 10 weeks between contract signing and launch neutron signed a launch service agreement for multiple launches on neutron with a confidential commercial satellite constellation operator that signifies the beginning of a productive collaboration that could see neutron deploy the entire constellation announced a federal defense contract that supports neutron and the development of its archimedes engine with the us air forces research laboratory doubled engine testing cadence for archimedes over the quarter at rocket labs engine test site in mississippi alongside strong production execution at the companys engine development complex in california which included multiple engines manufactured assembled and shipped for engine testing significant progress made across neutrons structures and infrastructure including the completion of construction on the rockets assembly integration and test ait facility in virginia wellpositioned to onramp to the us space forces national security space launch nssl lane 1 program which began accepting proposals in november 2024 to onramp new launch providers to an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contract valued at 56 billion over a fiveyear period space systems completed production and delivery of two spacecraft on time and on budget for nasas escapade mission to mars selected by nasa to complete a study contract for a proposal to retrieve samples from mars and return them to earth a firstofitskind mission completed two new spacecraft for varda space industries to conduct the 2 nd and 3 rd missions to return inspace manufacturing capsules to earth executed on schedule against the companys 515 million prime contract with the space development agency to build 18 spacecraft for its tranche 2 transport layer program
Why did only this long call go down in price at market close today?,"I have 100 RKLB June 20, 2025 calls @$15 that shot down 18% at market close, but every other call at $12-16 is still up like 5-8%. Why did only these calls lose so much value? What kinds of things affect that? A little new to options so confused why that is.

Also, if I really believe in this stock and that the calls will pay, should I be buying the ""dip""?
