earnings update heres why analysts just lifted their rocket lab usa inc nasdaqrklb price target to us1436,rocket lab usa incnasdaqrklb investors will be delighted with the company turning in some strong numbers with its latest results it looks like a positive result overall with revenues of us105m beating forecasts by 24 statutory losses of us010 per share were 24 smaller than the analysts expected likely helped along by the higher revenues earnings are an important time for investors as they can track a companys performance look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year and see if theres been a change in sentiment towards the company weve gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models following these results check out our latest analysis for rocket lab usa after the latest results the twelve analysts covering rocket lab usa are now predicting revenues of us5942m in 2025 if met this would reflect a substantial 63 improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months the loss per share is expected to greatly reduce in the near future narrowing 34 to us025 yet prior to the latest earnings the analysts had been forecasting revenues of us5965m and losses of us024 per share in 2025 overall it looks as though the analysts were a bit mixed on the latest consensus updates although revenue forecasts held steady the consensus also made a pronounced increase to its losses per share forecasts despite expectations of heavier losses next yearthe analysts have lifted their price target 84 to us1436 perhaps implying these losses are not expected to be recurring over the long term fixating on a single price target can be unwise though since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets as a result some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the companys valuation currently the most bullish analyst values rocket lab usa at us2500 per share while the most bearish prices it at us500 so we wouldnt be assigning too much credibility to analyst price targets in this case because there are clearly some widely different views on what kind of performance this business can generate with this in mind we wouldnt rely too heavily the consensus price target as it is just an average and analysts clearly have some deeply divergent views on the business taking a look at the bigger picture now one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance andindustrygrowth estimates the period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same according to the analysts with revenue forecast to display 48 growth on an annualised basis that is in line with its 46 annual growth over the
