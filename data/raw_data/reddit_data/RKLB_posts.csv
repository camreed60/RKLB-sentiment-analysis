$33 Price Target - Hypersonics Garnering Some Attention,"Just a little Monday morale boost. Nothing really new here… some discussion about hypersonics in general and MACH-TB specifically. Guilfoyle gives a $33 price target at the end of the article.

On another note, I do see potential for Electron / HASTE (and production of space vehicles in Electron’s case) to become a much bigger deal. Electron, especially, offers compelling opportunities for USSF in terms of rapid response to orbital threats. There could be a future market for a lot of these launchers to be on standby…",196,39,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/veteran-analyst-forecast-rocket-labs-140700206.html

RKLB Share Price vs. Short Interest - Latest Update,"NASDAQ released the latest short interest in RKLB just a short while ago (dated 11/29/2024 when the SP was at the ATH of >$27).  Below is a graph showing plots of RKLB short interest (obtained from NASDAQ) overlaid with the corresponding day's share price (obtained from Fidelity) covering the previous 1 year and 15 days. The earnings call was the main driving force for the share price rocketing up.  Shorts were caught napping and they desperately had to scramble to cover their positions which probably drove the share price up even more to the new ATH of >$27. As a result, short interest decreased dramatically (\~20%) from the previous month. Short interest was still high at \~49.28 million shares short or \~13% of the float as of 11/29/2024. I think new shorts have since then opened new short positions (this is how shorts typically react after a massive price spike) and they’re heavily shorting the stock which is partially causing the downtrend in the share price.  The other reason for the downtrend in the share price is probably due to profit taking.  My thinking is that we will see share price consolidation in the $20 - 22 range at least in the near term.  What do y’all think?  Please share here.

Preferential treatment of SpaceX under Trump presidency,"Hi there,

I was analyzing my portfolio and was wondering what the effect of a trump presidency would mean for RKLB, since I would imagine SpaceX will absorb most of the government contracts due to Elon musk being in close ties with Trump. I'm thinking this will push RKLB to push for a more commercial approach and less relient on government contracts. 

What do you think? I will say that I believe since RKLB is a fair bit smaller than SpaceX at this point. I doubt anything will really happen in terms of competitivity from SpaceX, but I'm wondering how you see RKLB in this situation. It might as well be that this presidency opens up new opportunities in terms of Space exploration.

Space-X Tender offer of $350B…Good news for Rocket Lab and Space Industry,"No idea why my first post got deleted.  I didn’t see anything in it that was against the rules.  

If Rocket Lab is worth 10% of SpaceX as the #2 private provider then that is a market cap of $35B so $72 a share.  I wouldn’t be surprised if SpaceX was worth more on the public markets than for the private investors.  Look how much the market has driven up Tesla and Nvidia on future earnings that are several years away.  

My opinion is this is very bullish for Rocket Lab and investors.  The more money that goes into the space industry the more it will be spread around to the companies that can deliver.",371,80,https://i.redd.it/fxz0n4v8sj4e1.jpeg

Space Systems Potential,"Spinning off a comment, on a post that may get deleted, I thought an interesting discussion might be had on the potential of the Space Systems side of Rocket Lab.

From one of the recent articles on the CHIPs award of $23.9 million to expand manufacturing capacity of space grade solar panels. 

“Polaris Market Research to estimate that the global satellite solar cell materials market size will grow to $111.46 billion by 2032 at a compound annual growth rate of 13.2%.“

**Edit: the Zack’s/Yahoo Finance article says billions, but I’ve been informed the actual Polaris Market Research says $111.46 million. I found other sources that say $1.1 billion for space solar by 2030. Either way, nowhere near the above do I edited this post. However, I still believe space systems as a whole will be a multi-billion dollar revenue stream in the coming years, just with less of that from solar than theorized above.**

We are all excited for the Neutron launch and joining the medium lift market, the increased revenue, the increased margin with reusability. And the fact it opens up the Space as a Service market with a constellation launched by Neutron… I definitely am.

However, I think Space Systems is too often ignored in the future potential for Rocket Lab. Space systems, the manufacturing side of the business with space grade solar panels, reaction wheels, separation systems, satellite manufacturing, spacecraft manufacturing, etc… access to that market is going to be absolutely huge over the next several years imo, and is going to be a huge revenue driver for Rocket Lab. The bad inherited contracts from the Solaero acquisition are pretty much done with, the company just received a CHIPs award to expand manufacturing capacity, and alongside the other parts of space systems, I really see this side of the company driving it into multi-billions of revenue pre-constellation revenue. It has an absolutely massive potential imo and could really crank revenue through the roof as the market grows over the next couple years. The Constellation for space as a service will just be the cherry on top at that point.

Thoughts?

There’s a 10% change $RKLB wins big in MSR ,"I’ve been reading all over this sub that $RKLB was going for an easy home run scooping some good chunks (if not all) of the MSR program. 

Everyone else is also bidding, including SpaceX, BO and Lockheed, competition is rough ladies. 

Although i really hope we will land some big deal regarding at least one aspect of the project, I also would like to emphasise how unlikely it would be to actually get any big chunk of it

What happens after Neutron is operational? ,"Hi guys,

I am new guy who is starting to build a position on Rocket Lab. I recently watched an interview of Sir Peter Beck where he explained that Neutron will not only increase revenue from revenue launch ( duh), but also opens the door for new options. Is he referring to competing with Starlink? Is he thinking about bringing crews to the ISS?  Building a new space station? 

What are your speculations on what happens after Neutron? 

I rarely post stuff on reddit, Sorry if I do something wrong.

Thank you fir your answers.",65,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1h42jng/what_happens_after_neutron_is_operational/
