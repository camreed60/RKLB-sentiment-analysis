RKLB Share Price vs. Short Interest - Latest Update,"NASDAQ released the latest short interest in RKLB just a short while ago (dated 11/29/2024 when the SP was at the ATH of >$27).  Below is a graph showing plots of RKLB short interest (obtained from NASDAQ) overlaid with the corresponding day's share price (obtained from Fidelity) covering the previous 1 year and 15 days. The earnings call was the main driving force for the share price rocketing up.  Shorts were caught napping and they desperately had to scramble to cover their positions which probably drove the share price up even more to the new ATH of >$27. As a result, short interest decreased dramatically (\~20%) from the previous month. Short interest was still high at \~49.28 million shares short or \~13% of the float as of 11/29/2024. I think new shorts have since then opened new short positions (this is how shorts typically react after a massive price spike) and they’re heavily shorting the stock which is partially causing the downtrend in the share price.  The other reason for the downtrend in the share price is probably due to profit taking.  My thinking is that we will see share price consolidation in the $20 - 22 range at least in the near term.  What do y’all think?  Please share here.

Preferential treatment of SpaceX under Trump presidency,"Hi there,

I was analyzing my portfolio and was wondering what the effect of a trump presidency would mean for RKLB, since I would imagine SpaceX will absorb most of the government contracts due to Elon musk being in close ties with Trump. I'm thinking this will push RKLB to push for a more commercial approach and less relient on government contracts. 

What do you think? I will say that I believe since RKLB is a fair bit smaller than SpaceX at this point. I doubt anything will really happen in terms of competitivity from SpaceX, but I'm wondering how you see RKLB in this situation. It might as well be that this presidency opens up new opportunities in terms of Space exploration.

Space-X Tender offer of $350B…Good news for Rocket Lab and Space Industry,"No idea why my first post got deleted.  I didn’t see anything in it that was against the rules.  

If Rocket Lab is worth 10% of SpaceX as the #2 private provider then that is a market cap of $35B so $72 a share.  I wouldn’t be surprised if SpaceX was worth more on the public markets than for the private investors.  Look how much the market has driven up Tesla and Nvidia on future earnings that are several years away.  

My opinion is this is very bullish for Rocket Lab and investors.  The more money that goes into the space industry the more it will be spread around to the companies that can deliver.",371,80,https://i.redd.it/fxz0n4v8sj4e1.jpeg

Space Systems Potential,"Spinning off a comment, on a post that may get deleted, I thought an interesting discussion might be had on the potential of the Space Systems side of Rocket Lab.

From one of the recent articles on the CHIPs award of $23.9 million to expand manufacturing capacity of space grade solar panels. 

“Polaris Market Research to estimate that the global satellite solar cell materials market size will grow to $111.46 billion by 2032 at a compound annual growth rate of 13.2%.“

**Edit: the Zack’s/Yahoo Finance article says billions, but I’ve been informed the actual Polaris Market Research says $111.46 million. I found other sources that say $1.1 billion for space solar by 2030. Either way, nowhere near the above do I edited this post. However, I still believe space systems as a whole will be a multi-billion dollar revenue stream in the coming years, just with less of that from solar than theorized above.**

We are all excited for the Neutron launch and joining the medium lift market, the increased revenue, the increased margin with reusability. And the fact it opens up the Space as a Service market with a constellation launched by Neutron… I definitely am.

However, I think Space Systems is too often ignored in the future potential for Rocket Lab. Space systems, the manufacturing side of the business with space grade solar panels, reaction wheels, separation systems, satellite manufacturing, spacecraft manufacturing, etc… access to that market is going to be absolutely huge over the next several years imo, and is going to be a huge revenue driver for Rocket Lab. The bad inherited contracts from the Solaero acquisition are pretty much done with, the company just received a CHIPs award to expand manufacturing capacity, and alongside the other parts of space systems, I really see this side of the company driving it into multi-billions of revenue pre-constellation revenue. It has an absolutely massive potential imo and could really crank revenue through the roof as the market grows over the next couple years. The Constellation for space as a service will just be the cherry on top at that point.

Thoughts?

Why I'm Holding till 2030 at least. My RKLB DD post.,"# Introduction

I’ve been following Rocket Lab since 2019, before it SPAC-ed in 2021. Having already known the company, I aped in following the SPAC announcement in the range of $12-$15. Slowly averaged down the cost through the SPAC-pocalypse. Average price probably in the range of $8-$10 not $4.78 as I changed brokers.

[Current position \~168,000 shares. \(\~140,000 shares are mine, the rest are held for family\) Have only trimmed \~10&#37; of shares in the recent run up as part of risk management, portfolio was 100&#37; in RKLB.](https://preview.redd.it/vn1prfwdko3e1.jpg?width=1093&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af5f6ad220bd27de3e600e6edb768f1ac71a63ae)

With the increase in stock price over the last few months and the increase in newcomers asking price target questions and new posts every time it hits a new round number, people asking if they should take profit as they expect a pull back to happen, there hasn’t been a proper DD post in awhile and I feel that many are not capturing the point that Sir Peter Beck's end goal for Rocket Lab is to be an **END-TO-END Space Company.** In my opinion it will be impossible to attribute a price target for $RKLB just simply because the industry is still in its infancy stage, instead, what is important is to see just how much of the growing space industry Rocket Lab could possibly capture in the next 5-10 years.

This is my own DD post and is not financial advise, I will attempt to cover and break down Rocket Labs business segments and why I will hold be a shareholder till 2030 and beyond.

[Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, spacecraft, satellite components, and on-orbit management - 2024 Q3 Earnings Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/xjvg1d975p3e1.jpg?width=1257&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fd1ccef8c9bea2cbd8d74e37fac398b64680181)

Although in the name, Rocket Lab is not just a launch provider, but an end-to-end space company providing, not just the launch service but also complete spacecraft design, manufacturing, satellite components and on-orbit management. Eventually, the company intends to use the experience to deliver and provide their own service from space through its own **satellite constellation**.

# Business Segments

**1. Electron**

[Electron is the only reusable orbital-class small rocket. Capturing and reflying Electron’s first stage enables higher launch frequency without expanding production and lowers launch costs.](https://preview.redd.it/okycitpk5p3e1.png?width=1345&format=png&auto=webp&s=453be91a7aad8274d7fef195c42eeb1daf48add2)

Electron is a two-stage, small-lift launch vehicle that is able to carry around 300kg to Low-Earth Orbit. Its Rutherford engines are the first electric-pump-fed engine to power an orbital-class rocket. Electron is often flown with a kick stage or Rocket Lab's Photon spacecraft. 

Proven Reliability – Electron has already flown 14 times this year, achieving record cadence, over the 10 times flown in 2023. Electron is now the 3rd most frequently launched rocket globally in 2024. 54 launches (50 successes, four failures \~ 92.5% success rate)

Responsiveness – Electron can launch from three launch pads across two hemispheres, from LC1 A/B in New Zealand, Rocket Lab’s privately owned launch pad or from LC2 in Wallops, Virginia. This has been demonstrated recently with a HASTE launch in LC2 and an electron launch within 24 hours on Nov 24/25.

[🚀 Literally to the Moon - Electron's Capstone Mission](https://preview.redd.it/hq5mcset5p3e1.png?width=1786&format=png&auto=webp&s=dee6c94313ff18c3c7a9c27bc28a84338d2094ac)

Small but powerful – On June 28, 2022, Rocket Lab launched a CubeSat to the Moon - a pathfinding mission to support NASA’s Artemis program which will land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon.

**Electron’s existential crisis, or not?** – While Electron has limitations in terms of carry capacity of 300 kg to LEO and the threat of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 Transporter Rideshare missions, Electron’s reliability and responsiveness together with its tailor-made missions have continued providing strength in demand evident from the signing of multi-launch agreements with its customers (Synspective, Capella Space, Blacksky etc.) Many discuss the threat of Electron being replaced by larger rockets, such as SpaceX’s Transporter rideshares or even Neutron cannibalising Electron in the future. However, just like taking an Uber directly to your destination or the bus somewhere near but not quite your destination, Electron together with its kick stage provides unrivaled accuracy, hitting target orbits with pinpoint accuracy.

**Why Capella Space chose Electron over Rideshare** 

“Instead of burning propellant to raise altitude, it’s far easier to simply be dropped off at a higher orbit by the launch vehicle. Being able to go higher than available rideshare missions was a major factor in Capella’s decision to pull Capella-9 from its planned launch and procure a dedicated ride from Rocket Lab for Capella-9 and Capella-10, which were launched in March 2023 on an Electron rocket to a targeted 600 km. This was also a major motivation behind the follow-on contract for four dedicated launches on Electron rockets for Acadia-generation satellites, the first of which launched to a targeted 640 km in August 2023”

[Continued Strong Demand for Electron](https://preview.redd.it/9hfpllwg6p3e1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=89128d9ce6e6660cdcb992ff6f3fdf0609146069)

The demand for Electron is also seen to be strong with the Average Selling Price increasing to what was $7.5 million to now $8.4 million. Furthermore, many of Electron’s direct competitors, mostly small launch ‘aspirational’ space companies have now been eliminated from the market. 

[ Astra Space Rocket 3 \(Dead\), Virgin Orbit LauncherOne \(Dead\), ABL Space RS1\(Dead\), Relativity Terran 1 \(Dead\), Firefly Alpha \(Dead Soon?\) ](https://preview.redd.it/57p1sfxr6p3e1.png?width=1795&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7b46dc23f26f9abd7236e9fd03fdbffc8789f8f)

It is NOT Rocket Science. Can’t really say that in this industry. Entrants to the small launch space have not fared well, many attribute it to a lack of demand as some pivot to larger launchers but in truth it seems that Electron has cemented its place as THE small launch provider.

**2. Haste**

https://preview.redd.it/v3l86x177p3e1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=30266164d98e447732f8e430c99bb58d3a4b887c

HASTE is a suborbital testbed launch vehicle derived from Rocket Lab’s heritage Electron rocket. HASTE provides reliable, high-cadence flight test opportunities needed to advance hypersonic and suborbital system technology development. Hypersonic speed is at least five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5 and above

[Types of Adaptions of Electron payload for HASTE vs Space-Based Orbital Electron](https://preview.redd.it/x7qeoojz7p3e1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b1fcbe1a09d5f8d9e6e7f8299e281d99bf53245)

# 

From air-breathing and glide payloads to ballistic and future technologies, HASTE is a cost-effective and responsive hypersonic testbed that enables precision payload delivery for every mission.

[Leidos was awarded $334M air-breathing hypersonic system contract](https://preview.redd.it/rzpb8vfp8p3e1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=4995acc3b4ce982c65204c7969cc708a73981ec1)

Rocket Lab has had two HASTE missions so far, with the first HASTE mission on 17 June 2023 for Leidos. Leidos was awarded [$334M air-breathing hypersonic contract](https://www.leidos.com/insights/leidos-awarded-334m-air-breathing-hypersonic-system-contract) in 2022.

Russia has already demonstrated its use of the Khinzal hypersonic missile in Ukraine and the Pentagon’s warning to the congress that China already possesses the world’s leading hypersonic arsenal, the United States still does not possess its own arsenal of hypersonic missiles. As the US plays catch up, Rocket Lab stands to win, with at least another 3 HASTE missions for Leidos for 2024/2025  as part of the MACH-TB (Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed program.

Instead of highlighting how large the Total Addressable Market hypersonics could be, it would be more useful to highlight the innovation of Rocket Lab and also management’s ability to understand its technologies to adapt and create new use cases.

**3. Space Systems**

[We Don't Just Build Rockets in this Lab](https://preview.redd.it/03v1c2fk9p3e1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=27f2b92571ecd7eb36c692bb14caf370aa86db7b)

While rockets are really nice to look at, it is important to understand that launch business makes up only 20-30% of revenue of Rocket Lab, with Space Systems making up the majority of revenue contribution. Rocket Lab’s expansion into Space Systems through in-house capabilities or through acquisition is what seems to be most under-rated by investors/analysts.

**THIS IS WHERE I AM REALLY BULLISH. RECURRING REVENUE. MORE STUFF IN SPACE = MORE RECURRING REVENUE**

Starlink satellites have a lifespan of about five years. After which it will re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere and be destroyed. Satellites need replenishing, and companies are heading towards mega constellations to provide their services, Rocket Lab will either manufacture, provide components, flight software or even deploy them with Neutron. With the space economy projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030, and $1.8 trillion by 2035. Rocket Lab’s position as an end-to-end space company seems like a no-brainer as long as the company is able to capture a portion and with more than 1,700 satellites launched to orbit with Rocket Lab technology already, it seems to be on the right path. Some highlights of Rocket Lab’s space systems.

**a. Reaction Wheels**

[Love that we now ship pallets of reaction wheels to constellation customers. - Peter Beck](https://preview.redd.it/fofd4136bp3e1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=26d87d2a06b834269b21f22762292abb2dd2e37a)

A satellite typically needs at least three reaction wheels to control its movement along the X, Y, and Z axes. However, satellites often have four reaction wheels for redundancy

Deal already signed with a [single confidential mega constellation customer ](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/24/rocket-lab-reveals-big-supplier-deal-with-mystery-mega-constellation-customer/#:~:text=In%20its%20data%20sheet%20on,the%20base%20price%20at%20%24100%2C000)for thousands of reaction wheels per year. If you’re wondering who it could be… [Amazzz](https://www.youtube.com/live/wmmNuU8-Tr8?si=xpO2MeoKJ2KyHw5F&t=1218)

Amazon’s Kuiper constellation will have an initial 3,236 satellites Which likely will need replenishing every five years as well. That’s a good stream of recurring revenue for reaction wheels alone.

[\~4,000 to 5,000 satellites launched annually in 2030 - McKinsey](https://preview.redd.it/lmb1i4tmcp3e1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e5378628bdb2ce794333f878b8f54c530979638)

McKinsey anticipates in the base case, 27,000 active satellites in orbit by the end of 2030, almost a four-fold increase from today. To maintain that number at the assumed lifespan, there would need to be 4,000 to 5,000 satellites launched per year. In the high-demand scenario, in which nearly all proposed constellations materialize, McKinsey would expect to see more than 65,000 satellites, including many heavier ones, on orbit by 2030.

**b. Space Grade Solar**

[In 2022, Rocket Lab acquired leading satellite solar power producer SolAero Technologies. ](https://preview.redd.it/boenu4xrdp3e1.png?width=921&format=png&auto=webp&s=35bc3927f9baa504c4f498ec3ffddf844c274cd2)

Satellites need power. With the acquisition of Sol Aero, Rocket Lab is now one of the few space grade solar providers. Already there are more than 1,100 satellites in space powered by Rocket Lab solar products. The company has also been [awarded $23.9million](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-11-25/us-finalizes-awards-to-bae-systems-rocket-lab-for-semiconductor-chips) to boost the company’s production of solar cells by 50% over the next three years.

**c. Separation Systems**

[No separation anxiety - Example of Rocket Lab’s Separation System](https://preview.redd.it/i8s75ussep3e1.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a75dda0512efd875bab92e6f01da9ca86fee5d96)

In 2021 Rocket Lab acquired Planetary Systems Corporation which has designed, built, and delivered separation systems for more than 20 years with a 100% success rate - no product has ever failed to operate in flight. With the scale and resources of Rocket Lab behind the team, we are now making separation systems available globally at scale.

**d. Space Software**

[In October 2021, Rocket Lab acquired Advanced Solutions, Inc \(ASI\), a Colorado-based aerospace engineering firm delivering mission proven space software, mission simulation, and testing solutions.](https://preview.redd.it/quczg7jyep3e1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=98c4593cdd1a44f7e5e3377c5ea0b8be3c21a571)

As part of the end-to-end service, Rocket Lab also provides software and operation for customer satellites.

The vertically integrated and end-to-end space service Rocket Lab provides will allow customers who are looking to provide a service from space do so without any knowledge of building and operating spacecrafts.

Right now companies like Varda are still space companies applying pharmaceutical and life science applications, and even have outsourced [Rocket Lab will to conduct in-space operations](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-completes-second-spacecraft-for-varda-space-industries-advancing-in-space-manufacturing/), reentry positioning maneuvers, and deorbiting to recover Varda’s capsule while they attempt to develop the own in-house solutions. However, Rocket Lab's end goal as THE end-to-end space provider, is for companies with no knowledge of building or operating spacecrafts contracting Rocket Lab for its services.

**4. Catalysts**  
Written so much and I have not even covered Neutron, Space Race, Possibility with Mars Sample Return, NSSL Neutron On-ramping, SDA Contracts, Human rated Neutron launches. I'll point over to [Dave G Investing's video](https://youtu.be/rt4_g87TxL8?si=PHAi9oegs_13u0AL) on the potential nearer term catalysts, I think he covers it in great detail.

[Dave G Investing - Potential Catalysts](https://preview.redd.it/xvnfaef9jp3e1.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=540f11194cebd49866ceb72b3b7a7e6e628b4a0c)

Further term growth opportunities include Neutron signing more commercial launches to deploy constellations or even taking on some contracts to help deploy Kuiper if any of their launch providers for their 83 launches fail to deliver. Also as SPB mentioned, Neutron’s success will then allow for Rocket Lab to develop its own constellation. These catalysts really show the uncapped potential of the company, which makes valuing the company today extremely difficult, which is why I will be holding my shares, at least a good amount of it till 2030.

**5. Conclusion**

[This guy doesn't build shit](https://preview.redd.it/wqzjk4zmjp3e1.png?width=1505&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5b3ab591beb4426ff8223a327fa6c41f8e14b44)

Trust in SPB. He knows Rockets. Watch Wild Wild Space on HBO for those who haven't.

Rocket engineer at heart, he developed Electron with less than $100 million compared to rockets like Virgin Orbit's LauncherOne estimated to be over $1 billion and still failed.

Let's talk MSR and competing proposals...,"MSR. So hot right now. For better or worse, I wanted to share my opinions on the likelihood RKLB gets the MSR mission.

I realize we only have the abstracts for the proposals, but it should be enough to tell us who is taking this seriously. I'm honestly flabbergasted at some of the proposals, and I've attempted to summarize the abstracts even further below. You'll quickly see that it's a two, MAYBE three horse race... and RKLB is in it.

* Rocket Lab: ""We put a lot of effort into this proposal, and intend to show you just why we are the perfect choice. We can and have done nearly everything you're asking a company to do, we have a proven track record and a reliable path to mission success, and we can do it faster and cheaper than anyone else.""

* Lockheed Martin: ""Sure, we can do it for your max budget and.... sometime... before 2040. We have lots of experience with this stuff, dude. We've partnered with you before and we sure liked all the cash you filled our coffers with. Give us the contract and we will do the bare minimum to meet any of your needs. But we're pals, man! Like, our relationship goes WAY back... and don't forget the lobbying money we spend! So... can we have the money now? kthx""

* Blue Origin: ""So you're already building SLS and HLS, so...let's like... leverage those options, and then you won't even need to worry about how many samples you can return! *SLAPS 4 BILLION DOLLAR ROCKET* This baby can fit SO MANY mars samples inside of it!! We can't talk about schedule because uh.... that's kind of on you (wink wink) but uh.... we think by using these options you might be able to accelerate your schedule? But listen to THIS... we've got a couple of super brainy Ph.D.'s leading a ""team"" of EXPERTS looking into all of this, and they have a whole 50 years of combined experience on mars missions! So uh.... pick us, and then we might actually take any of this seriously.""

* Quantum Space: ""We develop spacecraft. Or.... I guess... we're trying to. We haven't had any success at all, but we're smart cookies who think outside the box!! We think we came up with a novel but quite difficult approach to trajectory and spacecraft needs by basically doing a lunar orbit rendezvous and hand off of the samples to another vessel before returning to Earth. Sure, we know you're probably going to call this bullshit, be we prefer to call it a ""disruptive concept"""".

* Aerojet Rocketdyne: ""We're smart cookies and we take this seriously. We've already identified areas where we can reduce the mass of the theoretical MAV and SRL, and that would allow us to use existing technologies to get the lander on the surface. We've been doing this a long time and have a lot of success, and we've already started to figure out which propulsion technologies would fit into a mission like this or which would need to develop further. We really want to use the skycrane to land the MAV, and will likely concentrate all efforts on that front since it would speed things up considerably. The reduced mass MAV and SRL will allow us to return plenty of samples.""

* Northrop Grumman: ""So we are like, quite competent in propulsion, and we've been doing this stuff for like, a really long time. We will do some uh.... engineering.... and uh, we want some government money so we can keep developing our solid rocket motors. And then you can use them for this mission!! :D""

* SpaceX: ""Uhh... we're already going to mars. We don't know when, but.... we can just pick up your samples for you while we're there, and then charge you a shit ton of money for the privilege :) Sit back and relax!""

* Whittinghill Aerospace: ""We're a cutting-edge tech firm out of the Midwest, awaiting imminent patent approval on the next generation of ~~radar detectors (D2D)~~ MON hybrid rocket motors that have both huge military and civilian applications. Now, right now John, our stock trades over the counter at $0.10.... but we..... oh shit.... wrong number.""


So, alright then. We have some serious proposals, and we have some jokers. I think there are a few that you can remove straight off the bat. Whittinghill and Quantum Space. One is an engineering company, and the other makes spacecraft. Lots of companys do both, these companies do just the one, and are both quite small and not in a position to handle such an important contract. That widles us down from 8 to 6.

This is where it gets a little tricky, since we don't know what's actually in the proposals... all we have are the abstracts. But taking things at face value, there are a few additional proposals that don't really seem to be taking it seriously, or don't really offer any value to NASA by choosing them. Those options are Lockheed, BO, and Northrop. Yes, THOSE BIG THREE. Why? Lockheed is basically ""max budget, max timeline"". What incentive does that provide? BO relies on SLS sticking around AND on HLS sticking around.... which kinda feels like a complication of.... the SpaceX option? And Northrop can just pound sand. Their abstract is one of the worst in the whole bunch outside of Whittinghil and Quantum IMO. 

So... that leaves THREE actual ""competitors"" IMO. Let's dig into those. Rocket Lab, SpaceX, and Aerojet Rocketdyne, so let's start with Rocketdyne. They've put in the effort here, and have the company heritage to execute on their claims. They want to leverage existing technologies, while developing their rocket motors further so they can reduce the weight of the MAV. Smart cookies here, but no real promise on a timeline. Just vague talks of being able to 'accelerate' the timeline if they CAN leverage the skycrane the way they want. Solid choice, reasonable value to NASA. I give this option a B+.

Now let's talk about SpaceX. It's not so much a 'proposal' for a 'mission' as it is like, ""Hey Jim, I'm running to the store anyways. Want me to bring you back anything? Oh...no... I'm not going now. I'm going in like... 5-9 years... or something?"". It's not a BAD proposal, but without knowing the financials it's hard to say how likely NASA would be to choose this option. They're relying on HLS anyways, so if Starship is gonna be a thing, this could make sense. But they lose a lot of control, and who knows if their proposal is for a $9B budget and a return date in 2038? They don't say, and I don't think NASA will like losing that much control and influence on the mission. I give this option a C-. Feasible, but probably not NASA's best actual choice, since it really strips them of their autonomy.

And finally.... Rocket Lab. They can do it for under $2B on a fixed-price contract WAY earlier than NASA's requirement of 2040. They've built spacecraft, sent spacecraft to the moon using multiple trajectory burns, they've engineered and built spacecraft busses, reaction wheels, solar panels, navigation and guidance systems, rocket engines and rockets themselves, and they've even returned a capsule to earth that had samples inside of it already. They can do the entire mission, end-to-end, for 18.1% of NASA's budget, and get the samples here almost a DECADE earlier than required. Even IF NASA choose RKLB and they didn't deliver as promised, NASA would have SO much damn cash left to pursue other avenues (and presumably, almost a decade to do it...) that it would seem almost criminal for them not to select the RKLB proposal. RKLB could fail and they'd still be likely to succeed ""Hey Elon... grab us some samples on your next 2038 Mars mission... here's $5B"". Cool. NASA still got the samples back before 2040 and for $7B. I give this proposal an A-. The only thing keeping me from an A or an A+ is that Neutron isn't flying yet.

So, those are my big three that have a chance, but I personally think it boils down to Rocket Lab and Aerojet Rocketdyne. SpaceX is going to mars anyways, and like I mentioned above, we could just pivot to having them bring us back some samples a decade from now if things don't otherwise work out. For that reason, I give the SpaceX proposal a 15% chance of being selected, the Rocketdyne proposal a 40% chance of being selected, and RKLB a 45% chance of being selected. I'm assuming all the proposals I 'eliminated' earlier have a 0% chance, but that's likely not true. However, I wanted to simplify this.

So, from my seat, RKLB is actually the MOST likely proposal to be selected for MSR? Why? Execution, cost, and timeline PLUS the ability to NASA to pivot to SpaceX in the 2030's if necessary. Rocketdyne a close second.

An Observation ,"I’m sure we’re all excited about another monster trading session after a surreal run up.  I’m probably not the only one wondering each week if, and when, the eventual pull back is going to happen..  only to see the stock go higher.

I thought I’d share a quick story of an interaction earlier today to give some context to what many of us wrestle with.

I went to PT this morning, and we were shooting the breeze about life when she asked what I was up to.  We’re pretty good friends at this point, and the conversation drifted towards investing since it’s something I’m passionate about.  Naturally, Rocket Lab came up, and she was genuinely curious so I spent some time sharing the bullet points about the company, Peter Beck, the sector, etc.  The other two providers that were nearby joined in the conversation since they didn’t have clients at the time, and so I talked to them about it too.

What was absolutely fascinating to me was that none of them had ever heard of Rocket Lab.  These are intelligent, accomplished, capable medical professionals.  

People like to joke about you know it’s time to sell when you over hear Uber & Lyft drivers talking about a stock.  I think the opposite is true as well.  Anecdotally, outside of this sub, WSB, and X/twitter, there is practically no one in my professional or personal spheres that has heard of this company - unless I’ve personally told them about it.  

My point is..  the recent run up as been incredible, and while there is a very real possibility of a drawback in the near future, especially for some unforeseen news or black swan event, this company is still one of the best kept secrets.  

Of course I could be wrong, and there is a lot of risk ahead and plenty that could go badly..  However, I think this is still just the initial wave crashing upon the shoreline.  Once more people clue in, it’s going to be interesting.

I’d be very curious how many folks on this sub have had anyone tell them about RKLB, and not the other way around.

TLDR:  we are just getting started.

Powerful endorsement yesterday by Blackrock for both ASTS and RKLB,"i am pretty sure no one posted this on this sub, so here goes:

Tony Kim, Head of Technology Investing at BlackRock, discusses AST SpaceMobile and Rocket Lab at the Deutsche Bank Global Space Summit 2024.

“In the public market, I think there are two companies that are over $5B and they have been a recent resurgence, but it has been 20 years of hell. But there has been a recent resurgence of two companies that crossed $5B of market cap …. And the two are not posterchilds of profitability. What they are is that they represent leadership. The power log ?
In the case of one company regarding potentially unlocking direct communications and the other one , the alternative to SpaceX on launch. So those are the two. They’re not really profitable yet, but they have the market valuation. The rest, they are mired in small subset of valuations? So yes, profitability is of course important, but I think more important is, are you a viable business with scale. Are you one of the companies that will achieve scale. And with scale comes profitability.”

Should You Buy $RKLB After the Big Run-Up? Here’s a Litmus Test,"Hey everyone,

I’ve noticed a lot of posts lately asking, “Should I buy $RKLB now after the huge price increase?” Here’s a litmus test to help guide your decision:

First, ask yourself: If you already owned the stock, would you sell it now? If the answer is no because you think the price will continue to rise, then why wouldn’t you buy more now? If you believe in the company’s long-term future, the recent run-up shouldn’t deter you.

Remember, investors are in it for the long haul. Traders are the ones making short-term moves. And if you’re asking a biased community for financial advice, it’s probably a sign that you’re not the best trader. Timing the market is notoriously difficult, and most people don’t get it right.

So instead of focusing on short-term fluctuations, ask yourself if Rocket Lab’s long-term vision aligns with your investment goals. Don’t try to time the market—make decisions based on your confidence in the company’s future.

As always, do your own research and assess your personal financial situation.

Neutron and a mega constellation, along with a thriving space systems business, is a ways away. That's the carrot at the end of the stick. Even so, that can't be the end of the story. I find it difficult to believe that is as far as it goes.

Space operations and management constellation?,"With the imminent retirement of the NASA ""Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System"" (TDRS), I have been wondering if some sort of space operations and management constellation might be a good candidate for Rocket Lab's first space services constellation?

First some background courtesy of Chat GPT:

**What is the TDRS?**

The *Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System* (TDRS) is NASA's communication network used to support real-time data and command transmission between Earth and spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO), such as the International Space Station and the Hubble Space Telescope. Operating since 1983, TDRS consists of multiple geostationary satellites and ground stations, providing near-continuous coverage.

The system facilitates telemetry, tracking, and data transfer, enabling critical operations for various NASA missions. NASA is transitioning to commercial services as TDRS ages.

**What is the CSP?**

The *Communication Services Project* (CSP) is a NASA initiative aimed at transitioning from government-owned satellite communication systems, such as the TDRS, to commercially operated services. The CSP involves partnerships with private companies to develop and demonstrate advanced communication capabilities for space missions. These capabilities include satellite relay, ground-to-space communications, and data transmission, ensuring reliable and cost-effective support for NASA's future needs. The project is a cornerstone of NASA's strategy to leverage private-sector innovation for space infrastructure.

**What is SSA?**

*Space Situational Awareness* (SSA) refers to the ability to track and understand the behavior of objects in space, including active satellites, debris, and other spacecraft. SSA involves monitoring their positions, predicting potential collisions, and assessing risks to space operations. It is crucial for satellite operators, governments, and military organizations to ensure safe and sustainable use of Earth's orbits, particularly as space becomes increasingly crowded with new satellites and debris. SSA data is gathered using ground-based and space-based sensors, radar, and optical systems.

**What is a SON?**

*Satellite Operations Network* (SON) refers to the integrated system of ground stations, communication links, and software infrastructure used to manage, monitor, and control a satellite or a constellation of satellites. The SON ensures the execution of mission commands, monitors telemetry data, and facilitates two-way communication between satellites and operators. Advanced SONs often include automation, real-time data analysis, and tools for handling large-scale constellations with minimal human intervention.

**What is STM?**

*Space Traffic Management* (STM) refers to the planning, coordination, and execution of operations to ensure the safe and sustainable use of Earth’s orbital environment. It encompasses tracking space objects (satellites, debris), avoiding collisions, managing orbital slots, and coordinating launches. STM combines policy frameworks, technical systems (like SSA), and international cooperation to mitigate risks from space congestion and orbital debris, ensuring efficient and safe space operations for both public and private entities.

**What would you call a combined SSA, SON and STM system?**

A combined system integrating *Space Situational Awareness* (SSA), *Satellite Operations Network* (SON), and *Space Traffic Management* (STM) could be called an *Integrated Space Operations and Management System* (ISOMS) or *Unified Orbital Management Network* (UOMN).

Such a system would unify tracking, operational control, and traffic management functions, ensuring seamless coordination between monitoring orbital environments, controlling satellite constellations, and preventing collisions or other orbital conflicts. This integration would enable efficient and secure satellite operations in increasingly congested space environments.

Thanks Chat GPT!

I'm not suggesting that Rocket Lab will join other commercial entities participating in the CSP, there are already plenty of big names there including Kuiper and Starlink. Perhaps Rocket Lab may partner with some of them. But it occurs to me that if you want to build an end-to-end space company, that designs, builds and operates customer constellations, you'll need some of the same functionality that the TDRS provides NASA - and you may not want to rely on other commercial CSP entities to provide it.

Back over to Chat GPT:

**Describe a UOMN constellation? How many satellites? How many ground stations? What orbits required?**

A *Unified Orbital Management Network* (UOMN) constellation would likely require a combination of LEO (Low Earth Orbit) and MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) satellites to cover both tracking and communication needs. The number of satellites would depend on coverage requirements, but a network of 30–50 satellites could be sufficient for global tracking and communication.

Ground stations would be strategically placed worldwide, with at least 5–10 ground stations for redundancy and global reach. The system would also need robust inter-satellite links, especially for real-time traffic management and command/control capabilities.

Thanks Chat GPT!

OK so Rocket Lab would need some help with ground stations, and whilst they have their own RF space radios, they may also want to pick up some space optical expertise. With $300M in the Mergers & Aquisitions kitty, perhaps there are some targets?

SpaceX Encourages Competition,"SpaceX’s President and COO encouraged competition in space, emphasizing that the market is enormous and that it’s unlikely SpaceX alone can service the entire market. Especially in space broadband, she described the opportunity as huge with room for plenty of competition. Basically, the tide is ready to lift all boats and they don’t see their construction of a luxury super yacht as holding anyone else back from getting rich in the new space economy…

On launch, it also appears they are willing to make trade offs in medium launch to capture the most profitable end of heavy launch in pursuit of their long term goals. That seems to leave the door wide open for Rocket Lab. Interesting comments:

“Starship is really a replacement. It obsoletes Falcon 9 and the Dragon capsule. Now, we’re not shutting down Falcon, we are not shutting down Dragon — we’ll be flying that for six to eight more years,” she said.

“But ultimately, people are going to want to fly on Starship: It’s bigger, it’s more comfortable, it will be less expensive,” Shotwell added.”",75,23,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/15/spacex-gwynne-shotwell-starlink-competition.html
Valuation ,"I keep seeing comments that RKLB is cheap and SpaceX is overvalued. Or other commentary that sounds like it is based on faith and not thought out metrics. Full disclosure I'm bullish on both. 

Morgan Stanley has probably one of the most publicly available in-depth analysis of SpaceX value. They note that 60% of the value is in Starlink. That would make SpaceX rocket side about a $75B valuation. Given their launch revenue was estimated to be $5.5B for 2024 that is a revenue multiplier of 13.6x. Apply that to Rocket lab and you get a valuation of $10b on $245m of revenue and you have a revenue multiplier of 40.8x. 

RocketLab's launch business is three times more expensive to buy than SpaceX's right now. Not sure SpaceX is overvalued (on launch).  Starship is arguably a much bigger leap than Neutron (new model vs providing a launch alternative to existing model). So, not sure how SpaceX can be called overvalued and at the same time saying RocketLab has room for another 150% gain ($50 share).

If this is correct (and it was quick and sort price analysis), does RKLB benefit from IPO access and demand for the sector that cannot be easily accessed via SpaceX? Is there something else driving the multiplier difference? Yes both companies do more than launch, but one has turned that into revenue while the other is just starting down that path. And that portion of the valuation is pulled out of SpaceX in the above analysis and assumed to be $0 for RKLB. 

Maybe that's the difference. That the market is already valuing the non-launch business at even more astronomical multipliers than SpaceX's non-launch business.",61,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1gs6fmx/valuation/

Confidential Customers?  Expect more of them and why I’m accumulating shares.,"First of all I screwed up buy reducing my shares after it gained 200%.  I was buying at $3.5 - $6 and after a healthy increase I sold some around $10.  I still have a good amount and I’m accumulating again and here is why…

This latest launch was by a “confidential customer” and the new contracts for neutron are also from a “confidential customer.”  I knew they would beat earnings since the new customer wasn’t factored into the earnings forecast during the Q3 presentation so I bought a bunch more and calls just before earnings.  Be prepared to see “confidential customer” a lot from Rocket Lab in the future.  A lot of developed countries, especially in Europe, do not see Trump as an ally and now that Leon is part of the government they want to distance themselves from him and SpaceX.  If Trump installs large tariffs then you can easily predict a trade war.  The faster these other countries get up their own internet satellite systems the better.  Not only do they not want to rely on Starlink for secure communications, they don’t want to rely on SpaceX to put up their satellites.  This is where Rocket Lab will be taking full advantage of having non-U.S. based launch facilities.  For those that have been here awhile there were rumors of Rocket Lab acquiring a constellation builder in the U.K.  I fully expect that to happen now to service their European and Asian customers and be fully integrated from build to launch.   I bet we get news of that before the 4th Quarter earnings in February.  Several people that are very Pro SpaceX / Leon  won’t read this far and you will see responses from them below calling this bullshit and how SpaceX is far and away the only real private company option for other countries….just watch.

My prediction is RKLB between $35 - $50 by the end of 2025 unless there is a black swan event.

Whenever I doubted RKLB I remembered the guy has been making rockets since he was a kid and DARPA took interest in his small rocket that actually went to orbit. Not to mention how many times I’ve read that Carbon fibre is a bad idea for a rocket. The guy is a bloody material science engineer. I’m looking at 40K up in my account and this is awesome. Congrats to everyone else who is as well. Won’t be selling one share for years. 💎👏,109,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1gqzx7r/congrats_hodlers/

Only the strong survive… the great SPAC attack of 2019,"The year is 2019… 

Virgin Galactic merges with SCH to create SPCE, ushering in a new age of retail space investing…

Virgin Galactic, rooted in the genius of legendary aerospace designer Burt Rutan and Scaled Composites, becomes a public company via Richard Branson…

Virgin Galactic promises a bright future for future space tourists and investors. 

Branson would later take small satellite launcher, Virgin Orbit (VORB), public via merger with NextGen Acquisition Corp. 

Virgin Orbit wants it all. 

On September 25, 2020… Vector Acquisition Corp goes public. 

On August 25, 2021,… a young, fledgling space startup company founded by rocket bike connoisseur, New Zealander, gold-prospector, and cabbage patch look-alike, Peter Beck, merges with VACQ.

Rocket Lab enters the commercial space race as a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ. But legacy space and defense contractors dismiss RocketLab’s Electron rocket as too small for doing serious rocketry. 

It is early 2023…

After a global pandemic and nuclear winter for raising capital, the shakeout is in full swing. Space launch startups like Astra, Relativity, and Branson’s Virgin Orbit are teetering on the brink.  Claims of large 2B backlogs and realities of horizontal flying rockets will not save them from impending doom. 

On April 4, 2023, Branson’s Virgin Orbit files for bankruptcy, crushing hopes of a free satellite launching future not dominated by old school contractors and the SpaceX monopoly. 

The demand for satellite constellations and real-time global connectivity grows. 

It is June 20th 2024…

Rocket Lab successfully launches its 50th Electron mission, the fastest rocket to do so. Rocket Lab is also in full swing developing its medium lift Neutron rocket. 

It is August, 2024…

The archimedes engine breathes fire. People are skeptical of Neutron’s new engine, calling bullshit on Peter Beck for not releasing a long video of a hot fire.   

However, Peter Beck confirms a hot fire later in the month.  

The industry is put on check.

It is November 12, 2024…

In the Q3 earnings call, Peter Beck confirms Neutron is open for business. The first Neutron contract for a constellation operator has been confirmed.

The rate to borrow on [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rklb) for tomorrow is 3.3% APR. Now that's not really HIGH but it is much higher than it was the past week because the fee goes up when more people want to short it (read about it [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-loan-fee.asp)).  So more shorts interested in us.  The more shares short, the more downward pressure on the stock. 

I still see blanket 10M shares available short but I don't know where that info came from or if it's the 2 week lag that is often placed on the public info (and I don't have a subscription to the services that update it).  IBKR shows shares still available but that likely won't update until 7am EST tomorrow as well. 

There's too many brokers out there but if you are long the stock and you don't want your shares leant out (to be paid a portion of that 3.3% because brokers take their cut of course), you should google: ""\[insert your broker\] opt out of securities lending"". 

All the brokers think this is a good thing - [RH](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/stock-lending/), [Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/securities-lending), [Ally](https://www.ally.com/invest/self-directed-trading/securities-income-program/), [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/fully-paid-lending), etc. - Likely your broker has it too. They all ""want you to earn interest"" but to read up a bit more on [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitieslending.asp).. but they summarize to this:

So if you like it and want it to go up... decide what you want to happen.. don't let the brokers decide.. 

Clearly it's all our individual choices but just some information from the meme stock era that might help us all.

Positive press for Firefly and its posture for competition against Neutron and others…,"What are your thoughts on the the heavy recent investment in Firefly? They appear to be targeting similar market segments to both Rocket Lab and Intuitive Machines - anyone here concerned about the potential for their medium launch vehicle to outcompete Neutron or otherwise siphon market share? 

From the article:
“In the hierarchy of launch vehicles, these one-ton-class rockets fit in between a class of heavier rockets, such as those from SpaceX, United Launch Alliance, and Blue Origin, and smaller launchers like Rocket Lab's Electron. Rocket Lab is the clear leader in the lighter launch segment, while Firefly is well ahead of its cohort in the one-ton launcher race. Like Firefly, Rocket Lab is also working on its own medium-class rocket called the Neutron…”

“NASA has awarded Firefly three task orders under the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. Firefly will soon ship its first Blue Ghost lunar lander to Florida for final preparations to launch to the Moon and deliver 10 NASA-sponsored scientific instruments and tech demo experiments to the lunar surface. NASA has a contract with Firefly for a second Blue Ghost mission, plus an agreement for Firefly to transport a European data relay satellite to lunar orbit.

Firefly also boasts a healthy backlog of missions on its Alpha rocket. In June, Lockheed Martin announced a deal for as many as 25 Alpha launches through 2029. Two months later, L3Harris inked a contract with Firefly for up to 20 Alpha launches. Firefly has also signed Alpha launch contracts with NASA, NOAA, the Space Force, and the National Reconnaissance Office. One of these Alpha launches will deploy Firefly's first orbital transfer vehicle, named Elytra, designed to host customer payloads and transport them to different orbits following separation from the launcher's upper stage.

And there's the Medium Launch Vehicle, a rocket Firefly and Northrop Grumman hope to launch as soon as 2026…”",7,20,https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/firefly-aerospace-rakes-in-more-cash-as-competitors-struggle-for-footing/

Now, they did $105,000,000 in revenue in Q3 And are only down $17,000,000 in the backlog which means they added $88,000,000 in backlog. 

I'm trying to figure out where this came from. They did state $55,000,000 came from new electron launch contracts. But that would only leave $33,000,000 between the 2 Neutron launch contracts and any potential space system deals.

Value of the Mahia spaceport?,"One thing that is occasionally brought up in the financial analyses is RKLB’s ownership of the Māhia launch complex.  

It’s obviously a boon to the company to own and operate its own spaceport but I’m wondering if it should get more play in discussing Rocket Lab’s uniqueness as an investment.  It seems to me that as time goes on, it’s going to become even more difficult to procure sites for launch - certainly in the US it’s not easy, and you have to fight a mountain of regulations (which may or may not go away under Trump).  Owning a launch site in a developed country with low levels of international air traffic seems to be a major strategic win and another big point in favor of rocket lab’s moat. 

Is there a legal/regulatory reason that Mahia is limited to electron launches?  Is this ITAR stuff (build neutron in the US, can’t ship that tech out of the US?).

Does anyone understand or can point to a source that explains the exact relation between Apple, Globalstar, MDA and RKLB ?

The way I understand it is Apple contracts Globalstar to operate a constellation to provide direct to cell services which then contracts MDA to build the spacecraft, MDA then subcontracts RKLB for most of the design / satellite bus

Sounds like the reaction wheels contract could maybe be for a Apple constellation rather than Kuiper

How do you see it and then what percentage of the 1.5 Billion can we execpt to subcontract its way to RKLB and maybe be announced at earnings next week ?

Advice to small investors on RKLB - Stay away from buying options for a while.,"This is an advice to small investors who are entering the market from an experienced investor who did lose money playing options.

Options are very tempting at the moment given the run RKLB had this quarter. Every stock will have pullback. When it does, time value eat away potential profits.

Your best bet through earnings is to buy the stock and sell out of the money covered calls for November end. The money you make from the covered calls, you can put it back into RKLB to increase your share count. Don't despair if your options are called. Do it again.

Consider buying options when RSI goes below 40 and MACDs are in negative territory. This is where technical analysis will help you.

If the options you bought are expiring worthless, you giving free money to whales. A $1000 from you pocket may not seem much. But a hundred players like yourself giving free money to whales every week is Big Whale Money.

We are coming off a consolidation phase and a gap up occurred today. From a technicals point of view,

1. There was a shooting star candlestick pattern on 10/24. Stock dipped by about 15% from a high of 12.09 to a low $10.16 on 10/31.  After this it crossed $13.
2. No major catalysts during this period. 
3. MACD's are crossing over and turning positive

The setup is incredible going into the earnings. I love this uptrend and I am betting that SPB has some great news to share on the earnings call. IMO, There are people seeing ""A secular trend"" and that's the driver for this momentum.  I mentioned this in my previous post. Other than that, I have no inside information.

PS: To newbie options players. This is not the best time to sell CC's. Option buyers, the premiums are just too high. Nov15 $17 1254 contracts were traded for $0.12. That's ridiculous. Don't throw away your money. **Sometimes, you miss the boat. Accept it. Don't chase it. Buy shares instead.**

Here's my take on Apple's $1.5 billion investment and the impact it could have on RKLB,"***\\!/ This is not financial advice \\!/***

For those who aren't aware already, Apple has just announced on Friday a $1.5 billion satellite investment with Globalstar to improve space-based communications for iPhones. The deal is expected to close on Nov. 5.

Here is all the information I could find in order to form a realistic expectation on the effects such a deal could have on RKLB.

First things first, Globalstar is the company with which Apple has been partnering with since 2022 to offer emergency services on its latest iPhones when terrestrial networks are unavailable. Globalstar is managing the constellation Apple uses to provide that service. It is specified in the deal that Apple will make cash payments of $1.1 billion to help Globalstar fund the new network of satellites but, it is also said that SpaceX is expected to begin launching those new satellites next year. It is important to note that Globalstar's constellation is in LEO (low-earth orbit) and that  their network does not \*yet\* provide more bandwidth-hungry services such as voice and broadband as of today.

**Back to 2022's subcontract with MDA:**

RocketLab is directly involved in Globalstar's ""old"" constellation because in 2022, RKLB was awarded a subcontract by MDA ""to lead the design and manufacture of 17 spacecraft buses for Globalstar’s new Low Earth Orbit satellites"". MDA is the company that initially got the contrat to build those 17 new satellites. Rocket Lab is also developing the Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC) for the constellation. The Globalstar SOCC includes a continuous satellite control and monitoring using Rocket Lab’s MAX GDS, a constellation-class ground software solution that provides complete spacecraft command and control. What is also important to note is that the telemetry and control radio for all spacecraft will also be a C-band variant of Rocket Lab’s Frontier Satellite Radio (Frontier-C). Rocket Lab's Frontier Satellite Radios are Software-defined radio (SDR). SDRs are a radio communication system where components that conventionally have been implemented in analog hardware (e.g. mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, etc.) are instead implemented by means of software on a computer or embedded system. 

**What are spacecraft buses?:**

Spacecraft buses can be referred to as satellite platforms which are the support on which to mount instruments and the infrastructure for the mission such as power, communications to the ground and navigation. A spacecraft bus consists of everything needed to transport, protect, and operate the payload. In our case, RKLB was in charge of the manufacturing of the satellite platforms in the 2022 contract and MDA was in charge of the payload which is the primary function of the satellite's mission. 

**MDA's new Aurora satellites:**

MDA announced their new Aurora satellite line in March 2024. Aurora is a new software-defined satellite product line which is basically a transition from analog to digital satellite technology. MDA has also made new partnerships with new companies to supply components for Aurora. 

Here's a list of a few partnerships I could find: 

1. Aerospacelab announced July 8, 2024 that it will provide more than 200 battery charge regulators for MDA Space’s Aurora satellites over a three-year period starting in 2026. These components are used to manage power distribution and battery charging in satellite systems. 
2. Airbus will supply more than 200 Sparkwing solar arrays that will be built on a designated line at Airbus' high-capacity production facility in Leiden, the Netherlands.
3. Switzerland’s Huber+Suhner was selected to supply more than 60,000 multi-channel radio frequency (RF). 

The list above refers to components that are used in the manufacturing of a satellite platform/satellite bus. If MDA was still using RKLB's satellite platforms, why would they buy components which are generally used for the making of the satellite platform and not the payload? 

Also, SDR setup involves an RF front-end connected to a computer that will perform the conversions from analog to digital. In other words and from my understanding, multi-channel radio refrequency (RF) is a component used in the making of a Software-defined radio (SDR). If MDA was still using RKLB's SDRs, why would they buy multi-channel frequency systems from another supplier? 

Obviously, I'm not an aerospace engineer or anywhere near that job industry, but prior to the launch of their new Aurora line, I personally think MDA needed RKLB's SDR to actually make their precedent satellite line ""Software-defined"". Since they've now developed their own fully software-defined satellite line, it doesn't seem like they'd still use RKLB's components. Also, the latest contracts for Aurora satellites do not mention any partnership with RKLB. In fact, MDA's press release in August 2023 about their contract with Telesat briefly mentions a new line of satellite and a transition from analog to software-defined satellites. It also seems like, by the recent partnerships MDA made for Aurora's components, that MDA is now making their very own satellite buses also. 

**From all the information above, here's what I think:**

1. It doesn't seem like RKLB is going to be the launch provider since SpaceX is already slated to begin launches in 2025. 
2. In November 2023, MDA received an Authorization to Proceed (ATP) contract from an undisclosed customer to start work on a new Non-Geostationary Orbit (NGSO) satellite constellation (valued at $180 million). The definitive contract for the full constellation (valued at around $750 million) is expected in 2024. We can hope for the unnamed customer to be linked to Apple's new investment since the contract and the constellation' valuations both make sense, price wise, with the total investment made by Apple's and the $1.1 billion payments that will be made to Globalstar in order to help them fund the new constellation. The timeline between the ATP with MDA and Apple's announcement for their new investment also both make sense. However, if that contract actually turns out to be tied to Apple's new investment, I'm not really optimistic on the fact that Rocket Lab is still involved in the spacecraft bus manufacturing.
3. Because Apple's main objective with their new investment is to improve space-based communications for iPhones, I see this new investment as an extension to their first partnership with Globalstar back in 2022. That being said, I think it would make sense if Globalstar continues to use Rocket Lab's constellation-class ground software for their new satellite constellation because from my understanding, the new constellation's purpose is to act as a complement to the one currently operated. 
4. Globalstar didn't want to elaborate on the upgrades their new constellation would bring to space-based communications on iPhones. By looking at RKLB's old press releases about the 2022 contract, I've found this very precise sentence: ""These new satellites and SOCC will augment Globalstar’s existing constellation delivering reliable mobile satellite voice and data services from space."" However, Globalstar's current constellation does not \*yet\* provide more bandwidth-hungry services such as voice and broadband as of today. Is it possible that the new satellites partly built by RKLB would provide such an upgrade to GlobalStar's currently offered services? 

I'd like to know what you guys think and feel free to share your opinion!

What percent of your portfolio is RKLB?,"With the recent run-up RKLB has increased to be roughly 6% of my portfolio.

Since there is a constellation gold rush to LEO with Starlink, Kuiper, OneWeb, IRIS, Chinese 30k cluster, Globalstar, PlanetLab, ASTS, ICEYE, SDA,  BlackSky, E-Space, Kineis, etc. it will be very busy up there.

Not astrology! Promise!!!  Just sharing what I have been watching on the latest uptrend…,"Not an astrologer.

(Post is) Not really a conversation starter or anything too noteworthy, but sharing because it does display strength and accumulation. 

Nfa though. I’m sharing something that reinforces my thesis. Rocket Lab will be 100$ a share and it won’t be a pump and dump (long time from now, but it’s happening).

This is how I know.

Connecting the chart / daily price action, and the accumulation that has happened on this uptrend... 

When share price has dipped to the low end of a range (chart flattens out for a week or so), I have noticed large scale orders spike (not retail buys, massive buys). Noticed the same thing when the candles trade sideways on each step of the staircase on this last rise. The large orders hit the tape on the lower end of the price range. Then, share price takes the next step up.

Like I said, nothing noteworthy. What it displays though can give you, us dumb money retail investors, a little more confidence in holding your shares. You selling isn’t going to really do anything to the price, not trying to sell you on my thesis…. but maybe it will help you not bail on an opportunity to change your financial situation without doing anything… Don’t get scared out of your position. 

The spikes on the price cost distribution chart display consolidation / institutional buying in at the low end of the trading range / building positions. 

To connect the images simply…

First image displays the daily chart, each candle is 1 day. The sideways price action is accumulation and is directly correlated to the spikes on the “cost distribution chart in second image. Then the last image displays the order flow for today. Notice the large scale orders. That is not retail investors. That is institutional buying and they hold their shares for a very long time. This allows share price to keep going up. Gradually, and not without dips.

Blackrock owned 4.9% of the company (just under disclosure requirements / 13 g). They bought another 1.1% of the company (disclosed last week, think they have 15 -30 days to file the 13). Yes they own everything, but a ~6% position is not to be ignored.

More institutions will follow. Current institutional ownership is just over 57%. Has increased steadily since the decrease in inst ownership when Kholsa distributed shares / lock-up ended. That was when price was ~ 4.50. 

If something negative happens (news / launch failure) look at the spike on the price cost distribution chart below the one we are at now. That is what stock astrologers call support levels. Buy more then. Usually takes another negative event to break that one.

This is the easiest money I have ever made. I’m just a science teacher. Money for nothing is welcomed. 

You do you, but hope you make money. There is plenty to go around. Would hate to see institutions make that money instead of you all reading Reddit posts on a Thursday night.

RKLB MSR odds increased due to Elon’s recent actions. ,"I firmly believe that all of Elons recent shenanigans (getting very political very quickly, paying for votes, claims he’s talking to Putin, etc.) are only going to help RKLB. NASA administrator Nelson believes that these claims about Elon should be investigated and I believe there’s a growing anti-monopoly mindset around SpaceX right now in this industry. 

Therefore, I think that NASA is more likely to choose RKLB over SpaceX for MSR due to wanting to help get other launch providers up to a near-SpaceX level quicker. 

But they won’t just do this out of kindness, I also cannot see any other realistic candidate with RKLBs interplanetary track record. The only other real competitor (other than SpaceX) is BO and they just don’t have the resume for this. Unless their application was joint with many other organizations, I just don’t see them getting MSR. 

We should be thanking Elon for his stupidity. 

Fingers crossed we get this…

Mars Sample Return Mission Abstract - Rocket Lab's (former NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory) Richard French,"Everyone here has heard about the NASA Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission for which Rocket Lab is carrying out a study, which may lead to a NASA contract for either a full mission or some parts thereof. 

Let's take a look at Richard French, the Rocket Lab's man who is mentioned in the MSR studies abstracts of selected proposals published by NASA. Mr. French was mentioned in the Rocket Lab's news article of 2024/09/05 as a decorated NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) lead system engineer who, among other achievements, helped land the Curiosity Rover on Mars:, before moving to a managerial role at NASA HQ and later JPL's STO:

>Rocket Lab, the global leader in dedicated small satellite launch, has appointed Richard French to the role of Director – Global Government Launch Services. Joining Rocket Lab **following 12 years at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)**, Mr. French’s new role will see him focus on providing launch and on-orbit solutions for United States civil space customers such as NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as international civil space customers.

>In his previous role at NASA JPL, **Mr. French spent several years as an engineer working across various missions**, including the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission (for which he won the **NASA Honors Early Career Public Achievement Medal** for his work as **a lead system engineer**) **and** **helping to land the Curiosity Rover on Mars**. After moving into **a managerial role in the Space Technology Mission Directorate at NASA HQ, and then JPL’s Space Technology Office**, he made significant contributions in implementing public-private partnerships with companies like Blue Origin, Astrobotic Technology, and Made in Space, and helped stand up NASA’s first start-up accelerator program with Techstars.

>(...)

>“Richard’s extensive experience at NASA and his work on commercial and government partnerships made him the obvious choice to lead government services at Rocket Lab,” says Lars Hoffman, Senior Vice President – Global Launch Services. “Rocket Lab is proud to offer frequent, reliable, and streamlined launch services to small satellite operators, and I’m looking forward to seeing Richard expand on Rocket Lab’s premium experience for our government customers.”

>Mr. French says: “I’m excited for the opportunity to continue enabling government agency space missions, but this time from the industry side and with the leading dedicated small satellite launch provider. I’m looking forward to building on the already impressive capabilities of Rocket Lab for government missions and working with government agencies to better support the expansion of commercial space.”

To the Ones Sleeping on RKLB,"A few months ago I stumbled upon RKLB and it was hella low… but I never pulled the trigger. As of late it’s been moving and so naturally i’ve been looking into it more and more and wanted to get a feel for how it stacks up against the competition (This is just for people who are relatively new… very obvious info). Rocket Lab is up against companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and some smaller guys like Astra and Firefly Aerospace.
 
Obviously Musk is the big dawg of the commercial space sector, with a $210 billion valuation. They dominate the industry with cheap rideshare missions for small satellites, which is bad news for Rocket Lab since they’re targeting the same market. Pretty much…. SpaceX’s scale and success are the biggest threats to Rocket Lab, hands down…. especially with the funding they just pulled too.

Blue Origin, while worth around $12 billion because they have Bezos running the show, the company is absolute dogwater for now and 0 threat. They are yet to surpass a suborbital launch lmao.

Now, Astra and Firefly are smaller but focused on launching small satellites at low costs. They’re not doing as many launches as Rocket Lab, but they could be disruptive by offering cheaper alternatives in the future but for now it's nothing crazy.

One company in this whole commercial space industry that kinda made me pause was Virgins Orbit. To really understand Rocket Lab’s position, I started looking into Virgin Orbit’s story. Basically for some background, they were another promising company in the small satellite market, valued at around $200 million before going bankrupt in 2023. This got me thinking though… was Virgin Orbit ever worth more? Turns out, at its peak, Virgin Orbit was valued at around $3.7 billion because of the hype around their air-launch system.

That’s when I started to feel a little nervous. If Virgin Orbit, a company once worth billions, could go bankrupt, what about Rocket Lab? With a current valuation of $5.5 billion, it’s not that far off. Given how tough the space industry is (super high costs, tons of competition, substantial loss when things go bad, etc), it’s a fair question to ask if Rocket Lab could face a similar fate.

After digging deeper (GPT search is goated for this), I found some key reasons Rocket Lab is way more robust and unlikely to follow in Virgin Orbit’s footsteps:

* Unlike Virgin Orbit, which struggled with consistent operations and reliability, Rocket Lab has a proven record of successful launches. As of now, Rocket Lab has completed dozens of successful Electron launches, building customer confidence and expanding its market share. Looking at Virgin Orbit…. Basically they had only completed a handful of launches and faced way more technical issues. Rocket Lab's reliability in delivering payloads on time and at a competitive cost is a significant advantage over the difficulties Virgin Orbit experienced.  
* Rocket Lab is not solely dependent on launch services. It has successfully diversified into spacecraft design, satellite components, and satellite management services, which provide additional revenue streams. This strategic diversification helps mitigate the risks associated with relying solely on launch operations, which was one of Virgin Orbit’s weaknesses. Virgin Orbit primarily focused on air launch technology.  
* Rocket Lab has future projects like the development of the Neutron rocket, which will allow it to compete in the medium-lift launch market, giving it access to larger payloads and way more lucrative contracts. At this point… Virgin Orbit was still trying to establish itself in the smaller payload market when it encountered financial troubles (so they weren't even able to get past logistics). . Additionally, Rocket Lab has been working on reusability with Electron, which could further reduce costs and increase profitability over time, a significant factor that Virgin Orbit lacked.  
* Rocket Lab has raised significant capital and managed its finances well, with plans to grow its business strategically. Virgin Orbit, despite its initial $3.7 billion valuation, faced liquidity issues and struggled to raise funds, eventually leading to bankruptcy. Rocket Lab’s revenue has been growing steadily, and while it is not yet profitable, the company's long-term plans for increasing revenue through more launches, satellite services, and new rocket developments give it a clearer path to profitability than Virgin Orbit ever had.  
* The demand for small and medium satellite launches is growing due to the rise of satellite constellations for communications, earth observation, and defence. Rocket Lab is well positioned to capitalise on this, having established itself as a trusted provider. Virgin Orbit’s limited ability to scale and capture a significant portion of this growing market played a role in its downfall.

In response to the bears (aka the liberal arts bull case for RKLB),"A few days ago I had an exchange with a guy who posted various pics Archimedes vs Raptor rockets.   A link to the thread ( https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/s/HOahYRJsur ), but the guy’s comments were deleted either by himself or the mods(?).  

In any event, it started out as just one of any number of posts going on about space x being so far ahead that nobody can compete.  I think the poster was a provocateur but also argued in good faith.  I found him to be broadly representative of a demographic of investor whose biases (technical snobbery and industry experience) are commonly found in arguments against Rocket Lab.  I think that those points are worth further discussion. 

I’m NOT an engineer (and this poster snidely pointed this out, in response to my comment that I don’t care about Archimedes looking like a wiry mess compared to Raptor).  I’m also not a quant of any type.  I focus on soft factors - culture, broad market structure, political and social movements.  I am a liberal arts shit head investor, and am proud to be one.  I was on NVIDIA in early 2022 (after many techies, yes,  but still before the market as a whole) because I read some novels about AI and read about GPT 3.  Not to toot my own horn, but focusing on soft factors like “how will other people perceive this technology?” and “where are the potential bottlenecks in developing it?” and “what companies are critical to this but have relatively low overall public awareness?” were critical to pointing me to Nvidia.  Much of the same analysis points me to Rocket Lab.

“Rocket Lab is technically inferior to Space X”.  Nobody disputes this. I take it as a given.  There is a wide gulf.  But does it matter?  Only if the technological gap cannot be overcome in the long run.  Why would Space X have an insurmountable technological moat?  It could only be one of three reasons:

1. The tech is too hard to replicate
2. The talent for developing the tech will only be at Space X
3. Space X will drive its competitors out of business before they can attain technological parity. 

As to 1, this is not true.  Saturn V rockets have existed for like 50 years.  Building rockets is hard but it does not require any significant breakthrough in fundamental science to match Space X.  I think this is not controversial.  It’s a question of scaling, money, processes, quality control, not fundamental scientific knowledge. 

As to 2: the commenter argued something to the effect that given space X’s advantage, no engineer would want to work for RKLB. This , frankly , struck me as prime Boomer Logic.  We have seen time and again that top talent wants to take risks and get exposure to upside.  Yes many engineers like to work for a more established company, but many will simply want the challenge, glory, and financial rewards associated with working for start up (or in RKLBs case, a mature start up with room to run).  

As to 3: Beck himself often rightly points out that monopolies usually do not last in the long run.  While this is less true in extremely capital intensive industries , he is generally correct and his point is buttressed by 2 additional facts.  A) space is a national security issue and B) Space X is and must remain a privately held company ( if it is to continue to pursue its mars goal).

I asked the poster to tell me who controlled airplane manufacturing during World War 2.  He responded a small number of companies incestuously subcontracted with each other and later consolidated into a handful of mega contractors due to government intervention. He made my point for me.  Vital national defense concerns are never run by pure monopoly; oligopoly is the rule.  This is because the market is artificial.  The government cannot tolerate a single company having a chokehold on vital capacity such as launch and space systems manufacture.  It requires somewhat competitive bidding.  It requires redundancies.  It also requires its contractors to satisfy national security laws regarding sourcing, supply chain, secrecy, clearances, etc.  Rocket Lab has come farther than any of its direct competitors (other than, obviously, Space X) in terms of being able to satisfy the governments requirements and delivering a product that works as advertised.  At minimum, Rocket Lab can deliver components for other launch providers ; the best case is that it can be one of 3-4 major government contractors in terms of taking payloads into orbit. 

The private vs public structure is also quite important.  Public companies are subject to disclosure laws that do not apply to private companies.  Control is dispersed, not concentrated in one person or small group.  This is a superior governance structure for the purposes of winning public confidence and political support.  Space X cannot go public in the near term because its stated goal of going to Mars will be severely compromised by introducing any form of outside governance.  I do take Musk at his word; mars is THE objective. Thus, it must remain in the hands of an idiosyncratic billionaire with many political enemies.  All the more reason for US and world governments to foster competition and incubate alternatives. 

None of this is to say that rocket lab will come out as one of the favored group of competitors- it is still a long, hard road with a lot of risk.  But I do not buy the thesis that SpaceX is untouchable and I do believe that RKLB is one of the top contenders.",104,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1g8mmdo/in_response_to_the_bears_aka_the_liberal_arts/

SpaceX recently earned a large contract with the Department of Defence for $775 million.  However in the same article the DoD confirmed that Rocket Lab (as well as others) are expected to bid for future launches.  

From prior news releases, we all know Rocket Lab appears to have a good working relationship and recognizes it’s a major future business as they created a dedicated National Security subsidiary.

Phase 3 Lane 1 - Damn that’s some JUICY launch money ,"https://spacenews.com/spacex-secures-new-contracts-worth-733-5-million-for-national-security-space-missions/

Any newbs out there that don’t know this, RocketLab last year had had to punt being on boarded because they no longer had a credible path to launch in 2024.

I think it’s pretty obvious right now that a path to launch in 2025 is extremely credible and in a years time they should be scoring some of these contracts.

These are yearly awards, so for shit and giggles let’s say Neutron scores half these launches.

4 launches at probably 70 to 80 million (DoD are extra juicy compared to a standard 55 million dollar launch.) That revenue is what RocketLab has made this entire year so far. 

I get distracted dreaming about MSR and the current stock price, but Neutron scaling is such a big deal. So much Cheddar.

"All these posts about how RKLB is ""overvalued"".","I'm seeing so many posts about RKLB being overvalued. How it's not worth $5B today because it doesn't have the revenues to support that valuation. These posters are missing the point. You, I, analysts, pundits, space enthusiasts, or market experts don't decide what a stock is worth. Only the market decides what stocks are ""worth"". And currently it's saying that RKLB is worth 5B today not because of what it's actually intrinsically worth, but because that the chance of it being worth 25, 50, 100B+ in a few years is becoming more and more likely.

A lottery ticket is a piece of paper worth nothing intrinsically. You don't buy it for the value of the paper. You buy it because it comes with the opportunity for it to later actually be worth a large amount of money.

It's fine if you want to trade RKLB and try and call the tops and bottoms. Honestly I do that with about 5% of my position, it keeps me engaged with the stock price and I don't feel like I'm missing out on taking some profits. But I'm holding 95% of my position long term, because I know this stock will eventually start running and not slow down. RKLB is doing everything right and has proven itself over and over in the past. The general public is just starting to catch on.

Trade RKLB if you want, but know that you're risking the guaranteed bag that's sitting right there if you simply buy and hold.",86,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1g6i4u5/all_these_posts_about_how_rklb_is_overvalued/

Why companies like $RKLB succeed in G2M even though existing players have the stronger balance sheet,"Large companies often fail in emerging markets due to their inability to adapt to changing technologies, consumer preferences, or market conditions. Of the original 12 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in 1900, only two have survived. **U.S. Leather** dissolved in 1911, as the demand for leather declined with the rise of synthetic materials and changing manufacturing needs​. Similarly, **Tennessee Coal & Iron** was acquired by U.S. Steel during the Panic of 1907, as it struggled with financial instability and competition​.

**American Cotton Oil**, which later became part of Unilever, shifted focus from cotton oil to food and consumer products, but it initially failed to capitalize on emerging industrial and chemical trends​. **American Tobacco** lost its dominance due to anti-trust laws that split the Tobacco Trust in 1911, reducing its market share and power​.

**Distilling & Cattle Feeding** was a major player in alcohol production, but Prohibition in 1920 crippled the company, forcing it to pivot to chemicals and eventually become Millennium Chemicals, losing its original market​. **National Lead** shifted from lead production to titanium dioxide, but its failure to keep pace with environmental regulations and new technologies saw it lose relevance​.

Tbh. that news is shocking. BlueOrigin spend billions of dollars and years of development (development started in 2011, was announced in 2014, first launch in January 2024) and right now they need 10 days to produce 1 engine?  
RocketLab started development of Archimedes in 2021, as a ox rich cycle in September 2022.  
We won't come by exact production numbers, but my educated guess is that they are currently producing about 1 engine per month.

In the Q2 earnings presentation they wrote that engine 2 were coming off the production line. 5 more were in production. And as Peter Beck wrote in context with the recent Archimedes video, engine number 3 already should fix the copper issue.

SpaceX has been so far out in front that one would think they wouldn’t be afraid of competition but they clearly are.  This is an actual filing by SpaceX.  It is clear that their CEO thinks they should be the only game in town.  Why would he care what ASTS stock has done when TSLA stock was one of the best from 2010-2020?  He basically burned $34B buying Twitter  which is over 6X the market cap of Rocket Lab or ASTS.  He could have probably tried to buy both by way overpaying and he still would have done better than buying Twitter.  For some people it is never enough I guess to win…it’s about trying to make sure others lose.

"If Trump wins, I'm selling.","I started thinking about the election and How it could affect Rocket Lab. And it dawned on me. Trump and Elon are best buddies. Of course Elon is going to use a Trump administration to kill off competition. Trump will direct every mission, NASA and DOD to SpaceX. He could even use the EPA to deny launch permits to any other company (who cares if it's BS, this is Trump world). This could kill Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, Axiom, Sierra, Relativity and any company that could compete with SpaceX in the future. This would be a tragedy for the whole industry that is just getting started. ULA will probably survive because they have been around the longest and have their own friends on capitol hill. But it will just be those two around SpaceX and ULA under Trump, that's my prediction.

On the Flip side if Kamala gets in I think they will actively divest from SpaceX wherever they can, due to Elon dislike. They'll be stuck using Dragon for a while because it's the most proven vehicle in the US (RIP Starliner). But I could see Dream Chaser getting another look from NASA.

A revelation I’ve come to realise,"One of the biggest unknowns we’ve had about Neutrons commercial success, is how well it will actually compete with Falcon 9. I for example, have always been hopeful, but a bit unsure about the fact that Neutron can only put 13 Tons into LEO in reusable configuration, compared to a much higher offering from Falcon 9.

Until the penny dropped that Falcon 9 is a mature design that’s been in production and service for well over a decade, and has seen many iterations and evolutions over it’s life.

I searched it up, Falcon 9s first ever iteration “v1.0” could only put 9 tonnes into LEO, and it wasn’t reusable. The second iteration “v1.1” could put 13 tonnes into LEO, and wasn’t reusable. It wasn’t until v1.2 came about in 2015 that it could then put 18.5 tons into LEO in reusable configuration and 22.8 Tons into LEO as an expendable rocket. It then later got refined into its next iteration “Block 5”, but it’s payload capacity stayed the same, and the en you’ve got Falcon Heavy which obviously has the higher capacities again.

So when you compare this to Neutron, it’s starting out brilliantly already. Considering Neutron is a foetus and Falcon 9 is a fully matured vehicle by now, and even so, F9 in its current state can only put 5.5 more tons into orbit than Neutron can (with both in LEO reusable configuration respectively). 

It’s safe to assume that as Neutron and Archimedes go through the development process and receive updates/iterations as it goes through its life and matures, that Neutron will be a very strong contender to Falcon 9. I mean, we already know that Archimedes in it’s current stage of life, will be operated at pretty low stress levels. And even at low stress levels, it’s starting considerably further ahead than where Falcon 9 started its life. Over the years of neutron being in service, when Rocket Lab refine and improve on their base design of neutron, when they learn more about Archimedes and how far they can push it whilst still being reliable to launch again and again and again, it seems safe to assume that Neutrons payload capacity will see decent payload improvements.

But my main point to realise is that Neutron is starting its life, leaps and bounds ahead of where Falcon 9 started its life, in terms of payload capacity and the fact that it will be reusable right from the outset. Obviously, this isn’t all down to Peter Beck masterclass, it’s been over a decade since F9 came to life, and technology has moved on since then. Still though, with this in mind, I feel a lot more confident about the argument of “How will Neutron compete with Falcon 9”. 

Will we see a neutron heavy? I doubt it but I’d love to be proven wrong in 5-10 years time. But with this in mind, not even taking into account that certain clients may pick rocket lab purely because it’s the only option that isn’t Elon Musk, AND the fact that Rocket Lab will offer end to end space services unlike SpaceX, AND the fact that Rocket Lab missions are tailored to their customers better and have a more precise orbit insertion, I think it’s pretty reasonable to assume that Neutron will at the very least, give Falcon 9 a good run for their money. 

The only thing that does still worry me slightly is that Falcon 9 has more than paid off for it’s self by now, so SpaceX will be able to price gouge/undercut Rocket Lab as much as they want (within reason), and Rocket Lab can only lower their prices so far to match it, after all, they have years of neutron service ahead of them to pay off the development costs.",59,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fttb0l/a_revelation_ive_come_to_realise/
Huge component of the business not yet factored into share price,"I wanted to point out something that others have mentioned before, particularly Vince is Bullish:

Peter Beck has said more than once that Rocket Lab is aiming to launch 50% of their rockets for customers and 50% of their rockets for themselves. This is because one of the primary purposes of their business is to create some sort of space infrastructure akin to SpaceX’s Starlink - some type of constellation that provides a service with high value for customers and high profit margins for Rocket Lab.

SpaceX’s valuation ballooned (almost doubled) to $200B since Starlink has come online.

When ASTS simply mentioned their constellation contract with AT&T, their market cap 10x’d in 3 months (before they had put anything into space).

Rocket Lab is fully vertically integrated (ASTS had to use a SpaceX rocket to get their first 5 satellites for AT&T into orbit). Once Rocket Lab is ready to begin building their own constellation, they’ll be able to do it at significantly lower cost than ASTS.

The only reason Rocket Lab’s price hasn’t moved on these repeated announcements of Peter Beck’s 50/50 plan for the company is that they haven’t announced exactly what their constellation will be yet.

But anyone that knows this company can pretty safely assume it’ll be a success that drives huge profits.

Remember, ASTS moved 10x on news of a constellation. Rocket Lab has announced a constellation too but there’s been zero movement (recent movement is due to other reasons like Neutron progress and price upgrades).

Once they announce the purpose of their constellation and provide a roadmap with more details, the stock could easily 2-5x in a handful of months. This will almost certainly occur simultaneously with the first successful flight of neutron or shortly after (6-12 months).

Thoughts on this?",57,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1ftnz5f/huge_component_of_the_business_not_yet_factored/
RKLB Short Term Bear Thesis (Long Term Bull),"The intention of this post is to outline why I consider RKLB to be an outstanding company with an overvalued stock price. I’ve been lurking on this sub for quite some time, and I frequently see people making bold price projections for RKLB’s future stock price with little to no substance backing up their estimates. That being said, I would like to provide a detailed breakdown for why I believe RKLB’s fair value is approximately $6 per share right now. This is a short term (1 year or less) projection, not a long term projection. I look forward to hearing your feedback and seeing where we differ in opinion.

*Let’s start with the good stuff. This encapsulates basically everything but the stock price.*

**Strong Leadership**
Peter Beck is exactly the right person to be running this company. He has the perfect blend of intelligence, charisma, and modesty to make the company as successful as it has been. The track record of successful launches that RKLB has achieved is a tremendous achievement for someone that, unlike his main competitors (Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, Elon Musk), does not have more money than god. I also see no concerning loss of senior talent, and I've seen an ability to attract new talent in recent months. Quality leadership is the most important thing I look for in an investment, and RKLB appears to have that in spades.

**Successful Track Record**
As mentioned earlier, the track record RKLB has achieved with Electron has been spectacular. 53 launches with minimal failures speaks volumes about the quality of the engineering talent at RKLB. Unlike many other people that have a negative take on RKLB, I actually don’t think that Neutron will struggle to reach a successful track record of launches and profitability. The recent hot fire test of the Archimedes engine was impressive, and it appears RKLB is on track to meet their goals with Neutron.

**Positive Catalysts**
There are several catalysts which I believe could completely annihilate my expectations for RKLB’s stock to decline in the near to mid term. First, an overall increased interest in the space industry from the market as a whole. Markets are always looking for the next hot thing, and it’s entirely possible space could be that. Just like artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, SPACs, etc., the space industry at large could see a significant uptick in investor interest. This could lead to an increase in RKLB’s multiple and stock price without necessitating an increase in revenue or profitability. Secondly and tangentially, an IPO of SpaceX could greatly increase RKLB’s visibility in the market. I believe a SpaceX IPO would cause a rising tide that raises all ships in the space industry, and RKLB would benefit. Lastly, I believe RKLB has a substantial amount of “meme stock” potential. The company’s name has been spreading within the forums of people that invest in meme stocks, and it’s possible RKLB could be the next big one as many of those speculators lose faith in GME, AMC, etc.

*Now let’s talk about the negatives.*

**Revenue/Profitability**
I believe it is fairly easy to project out RKLB’s likely profitability over the next 1-3 years, and I don’t expect to see many positive surprises on either top line revenue or bottom line earnings. Revenue is rising, but predictably, and I don’t see any significant catalysts for revenue to surprise on the upside. The revenue isn’t explicitly a negative as revenue growth has been strong, but the stock price relative to revenue is beginning to become unsustainable. 

RKLB became public in 2021 through a SPAC so we can’t too far back with their financials. In 2020 with seven Electron launches, RKLB had $35MM in revenue or about $6MM per launch.  In 2021 with six launches, RKLB had about $62MM in revenue or about $10MM per launch. In 2022 with nine launches, RKLB had $211MM in revenue or about $23MM per launch. In 2023 with nine launches, RKLB had about $244MM in revenue or about $27MM per launch. For the last 12 months (June 2023-June 2024) across twelve launches, RKLB had about $326MM in revenue or about $27MM per launch. These numbers show strong growth in launch count, total revenue, and revenue per launch. As we all know, most of RKLB’s revenue is outside of launch services, but their ability to launch successfully is critical for their future ability to generate revenue and profitability across all their business lines. For the first half of 2024, RKLB had about $200MM in revenue and they are projecting about $100MM in the third quarter. For the full year, I am assuming they settle in around $400MM in revenue for the year. Very solid revenue growth compared to 2023.

That’s all positive, but the stock price as compared to that revenue is overheated, from my perspective. Based on most recent valuations, it appears the market leader in RKLB’s industry is currently valued at about 23x 2023 revenue or 15x projected 2024 revenue. Obviously, SpaceX is a private company that is valued differently than in the public markets, but this multiple seems reasonable for the industry’s profit margins and growth expectations. I’m aware that RKLB’s business lines aren’t identical to SpaceX’s, but I believe Wall Street will utilize similar logic when establishing an appropriate multiple for RKLB. However, given SpaceX’s dominance in the industry and the significant amount of execution risk remaining in RKLB’s growth trajectory, it would be appropriate to apply a lower multiple to RKLB to account for this risk. At a stock price of $10 or a market cap of about $4.9BB, RKLB is trading at a 20x multiple on 2023 revenue or 12x expected 2024 revenue. From my perspective, this is not a large enough discount compared to SpaceX. I believe that RKLB’s multiple should be no more than half of SpaceX’s - 11.5x 2023 revenue or 7.5x projected 2024 revenue. This would equate to a market capitalization of $2.8BB to $3.0BB. This range of market capitalizations would equate to a stock price of $5.50 to $6.00 per share.

**Psychological $10 Barrier**
As previously mentioned, RKLB IPO’ed through a SPAC merger back in 2021 at about $10 per share. After experiencing a large but short-lived pump in the share price, the stock quickly dove down to the $4-$5 range where it stayed for years. Investors that entered a RKLB position at IPO or in the immediate run-up post-IPO are finally seeing an opportunity to exit the shares of a company that has done nothing for them for years as the S&P, Dow and Nasdaq have hit record highs. That being said, I think $10 will be a very difficult barrier to break both for practical and psychological reasons. The vast majority of companies that IPO’ed via a SPAC are still trading below their IPO price today. Increases in the share price above $10 are likely to be short-lived as we saw on September 30th, the first trading day after public confirmation of the successful hot fire tests of the Archimedes engine. 

**Conclusion**
In summation, I believe RKLB’s share price is experiencing a short term pump above what I’d consider to be a sustainable market capitalization based on their current and future revenue expectations. I expect the shares to return to $6 range before year end. I do not expect the shares to return to the $4 range. In the spirit of disclosure, I should mention that I previously worked for a private equity company that still holds a substantial stake in RKLB and SpaceX, but I was not directly involved in the private equity arm of the company so I had no special access to their investment theses or MNPI. I do still own approximately $50,000 in equity shares of my previous company. As it relates to more direct RKLB-related investments, I have a number of November 2024 put options with a $7 strike price that I paid approximately $.20 per share for. In the event my investment thesis plays out as I expect, I intend to convert the profits from the put options into an equity stake in RKLB with a holding period of 5+ years.

Why I think RKLB is a hold ,"I'm seeing a lot of new people popping up in this sub talking about gainz for ants. Y'all shortsighted motherfuckers. Look at the macro picture: 

1. US/China space race heating up. China is seen as a ""pacing challenge"" by the US military. Last time this shit happened during the Cold War, NASA spending reached 4.5% of federal budget. 

2. NO to monopoly. National security shit is not allowed to have a monopoly. Spacex will never be the only player. And it's valued at 200 bil, almost 50x what rklb is worth.

3. The huge TAM of space services in general. Lunar exploration, mars, LEO sats, spy sats, LEO experimental medicine, low gravity manufacturing etc. A lot of it is speculative you say? Well that's what investing in tech is about aye? You're looking for the NEXT BIG THING, not the last big thing. You might as well do GEICO and Coca Cola if you're of that bent. 

4. Actual working rocket and workable path to another big ass rocket. How many other companies you know put their money where their mouth is and can execute to a high level. Shit, even bezos is fking up with blue origin. I have more confidence in someone who has actually made a rocket fly, than some shit that's still on the pad. 

5. A good underpromise over deliver CEO. Sir Beck doesn't shoot his mouth off. Wanna know what that means? It means if he's anything like Musk, share price would be a multiple of what it is with hype. And I'm all for execute first hype later. 

6. Improving macro environment. Last time we had a massive reduction in rates after 08, there's a boom for 10 years. 2011 to 2021 were some of the best times in the market. Now with lower rates, you bet your ass the rotation into small and mid caps is gonna happen. Not least because lower rates make capital raising and debt obligations a lot more manageable. 

7. In other words, I fking love the stock. Positions: 
16326 shares @ 4.04 and 69 Jan 2025 calls.

RKLB has high variance in possible outcomes in terms of return, hence by Jensen's inequality it must be overpriced currently.

RKLB is clearly in technological revolution category and while it may rise a lot in the near future, once it integrates into the economy and shifts from idiosyncratic to system risk, it may all deflate in the end.

Cash and equivalents after reaching $8.04,"Thanks to u/wfriedma for the reminder, that with the price over $8.04, the capped calls Rocket Lab purchased a while ago should now be relevant again.

This is all from memory, and from my understanding of things, so take it with a grain of salt, but I think the current share price should now mean that Rocket Lab has about $700 million in cash and equivalents (rather than the ~$500 million they had at the end of Q2).

This is because the convertible notes that Rocket Lab issued were for about 69 million shares with a conversion price of $5.13. So that was to raise about $350 million dollars, that they will eventually have to settle either with cash or the 69 million shares (or some combination of the two).

To try to reduce the possibility of the full amount of dilution needing to happen to settle/redeem the notes, Rocket Lab also bought call options capped at $8.04.

The idea with those call options was that they would allow Rocket Lab to settle the convertible notes entirely with cash, without needing to pay more than the original ~$350 million principal amount, and without needing to issue any shares, up to the point of the share price being $8.04. Any higher than that and they'd need to either issue shares as well to completely settle the notes, or pay more cash beyond the original ~$350 million plus the proceeds from the call options.

In other words, the point of the capped calls was to allow Rocket Lab to pay back ""for free"" to the holders of the notes the difference between $5.13 and $8.04 per share for ~69 million shares (obviously not actually for free, the capped calls cost something like $50 million), if the share price happened to be at $8.04 when the notes were due.

So by my understanding, that works out to a maximum of about $200 million in proceeds from the capped calls, which should have been available to Rocket Lab as soon as the share price was above $8.04, i.e. today.

Saying that ~$200 million will now be added to their balance sheet is not taking into account whatever value the calls had on their balance sheet at the end of Q2 though, so I would expect my $200 million number here could be a bit too high, but it should be in the ballpark.

But the main point is, Rocket Lab should be in a significantly better cash position now, because of this latest surge in the share price.",30,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fpih3t/cash_and_equivalents_after_reaching_804/

Anyone here holding LUNR and RDW aswell as RKLB?,"I’ve finally pulled the trigger and put some money in the space stocks, and I’ve gone for RKLB, LUNR and RDW, with RKLB being the biggest holding of the 3.

My train of thought was, the more these companies grow and develop, get more cash behind them, capture more share of the growing space market etc, that these 3 combined will be absolutely raking the contracts in. RKLB for launch and end to end space services, Redwire for development and construction of higher end speciality space tech (their space 3d printing will be a huge bread winner imo, and then all their general high quality infrastructure like their solar cells, robotic arms, cameras, sensors, RF transmitters, in space manufacturing, their space greenhouses etc), and LUNR could/will be the go to company for getting your things on to the moon surface which is essential and they’re one of the only ones offering actual payload delivery to the moon surface (can’t see many commercial avenues for this currently but now space is more accessible than ever, I predict that america will want to have some amount of control over the moon surface, before China gets there first, I’d imagine establishing moon dominance will become a bit of a strategic/geopolitical thing)

Obviously this is all wildly speculative and a very, very high risk play. But in the long run (im thinking 15 years +), if these 3 are still around by that point, they’ll be space giants and there’ll always be one of the three receiving a contract for something. Obviously spacex will be hoovering up contracts too, but I still think that in the long term, these 3 will be consistentently winning more and more contracts and are probably positioned to be giants in the market when it inevitably consolidates.

What does the next year look like for Rocket Lab?,"Hi all,

Despite having owned RKLB shares for a few years now (bought around $10 in 2021 alas) when the stock went down and ended up in the 'forget about it for a few years' corner of my portfolio I, well, forgot about it and took my eye off the ball.

I have been aware over the past several months the stock has done well, and I remain a keen supporter, but would anyone mind giving me an idea as to catalysts etc over the next year? 

I'm looking to buy some in my secondary portfolio at some point soon, but I am hoping to get in nearer $6 if I can. Is this realistic?

I've been in ASTS as long as I have RKLB, so I'm well used to the volatility, and is why I'm assuming RKLB is likely to experience a pull back when attention drifts away from the space sector

3 Millionaire-Maker Space Stocks

Historically, space exploration and putting satellites into orbit has been within the purview of government-funded agencies like NASA.

That's changing, though. For-profit corporations can handle this work at least as cost-effectively as government-run organizations can. Elon Musk's SpaceX recently facilitated the world's first-ever private citizen spacewalk, for example, while Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is mainstreaming space tourism. Blue Origin's newest rocket will even soon be launching two Mars probes for NASA.

This is only the beginning of privatized work in outer space, now that technology not only allows for it, but necessitates it. Market research outfits Polaris and Precedence agree that launch services alone will be roughly a $50 billion-per-year business within a decade. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley and Citi both predict that the entirety of the science, technology, and services businesses linked to space will be worth on the order of $1 trillion by 2040.

Connect the dots. There's real investment opportunity here.

The top opportunities, however, aren't likely to be the obvious names. The potential millionaire-making space stocks are likely to be the lower-profile stocks that could even be considered a little off the radar. Here's a closer look at three of your better bets among such prospects.



Rocket Lab USA

It may not be a household name, but Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ: RKLB) has been very busy for quite some time now. Since its very first launch in May 2017, this company has put over 190 satellites into orbit. Its technology (like software, solar panels, radios, etc.) is also found inside more than 1,700 different satellites, as well as the James Webb Space Telescope. The two aforementioned Mars probes will also be flying with Rocket Lab tech on board.

While there's a clear market for satellite launches, Rocket Lab's been at it for a while. For any ticker to offer real millionaire-making potential, the company must mostly be undiscovered. That, or it needs to be doing something new that most investors don't yet fully appreciate. In this case it's the latter.

To date, all of this company's launches have utilized its so-called Electron rocket. It's perfectly fine for putting small satellites into orbit, but it's not powerful enough to lift larger satellites, exploration craft, or people into space.

That's coming, though. The Neutron rocket expected to start flying next year will be a so-called medium-lift vehicle capable of carrying bigger machinery. In fact, it will even be able to provide the initial liftoff for missions to Mars and Venus. The Neutron rocket will also be reusable, making it cost-effective for the company as well as its customers. Perhaps most important, the soon-to-launch Neutron rocket will provide real competition to SpaceX, which currently dominates the medium-lift market.

And interest is definitely firming up even before its first commercial flight. The U.S. Space Force has already provided funding to co-develop an upper stage of Rocket Lab's Neutron rocket as part of the Department of Defense's efforts to ensure it's able to secure and defend the United States wherever and however it needs to.



AST SpaceMobile

AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ: ASTS) isn't nearly as far along as Rocket Lab USA is on the commercialization front. In fact, the company only recently launched its first-ever commercial satellites. These certainly won't be the last, however, now that the underlying technology has been proven and perfected.

It's not an apples-to-apples comparison. Whereas Rocket Lab designs tech for others' satellites as well as a means of putting them into orbit, as the name implies, AST SpaceMobile offers mobile broadband connectivity via satellites rather than cellphone towers. This tech is capable of connecting anyone to the worldwide web regardless of where they are -- no physical infrastructure (other than a functioning, web-capable phone) required.

At first blush, it seems like a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. You likely don't have any trouble connecting to the web, whether that be with your phone or a computer. That's not necessarily the norm, however, and that line of thinking underestimates a growing challenge.

See, as the world becomes increasingly connected -- including our cars -- our telecom infrastructure is being pushed to its limits. Much of the developed world is now running low on radio frequencies to assign to mobile phones and cell towers. Offloading this data traffic to fiberoptic connections has certainly helped, but handling such constant switchovers en masse can be technically complex as well, and still won't fully meet future needs.

There's also the not-so-small matter that such connectivity frameworks are vulnerable to power outages and other sorts of disruption.

Satellite-based connectivity, however, sidesteps many of those problems. It's not exactly a new idea, either. Even if not always practical or affordable for the average consumer, satellite-driven mobile phone connectivity has been around since the 90s.

Now that it's practical as well as affordable, Polaris Market Research believes this market is poised to grow at an average annual pace of 18% through 2032. AST SpaceMobile is smack-dab in the middle of this mainstreaming movement.


Intuitive Machines

Last but not least, add Intuitive Machines (NASDAQ: LUNR) to your list of space-related stocks that could turn out to be millionaire makers.

In some ways, Intuitive Machines is the riskiest of the three stocks in question simply due to its small size and young age. Its market capitalization is a mere $375 million, and while it's now producing annual revenue in the same ballpark following its founding in 2013, it's also still operating in the red with only a little over $30 million worth of cash in the bank.

In other ways, though, Intuitive Machines is arguably the least risky of these three stocks just because it's also operating the most practical, currently marketable business. Simply put, this company is helping for-profit organizations and government agencies get back to the Moon. Whether that's drones that land on the Moon to map it or a means of putting communication satellites in a lunar orbit, Intuitive Machines has a solution.

It's prescient, too, given that the Moon has moved back into focus as the world's next space-exploration point of interest, perhaps as a place to mine or colonize, or perhaps as a test run for a manned mission to Mars.

Indeed, NASA's Artemis rocket designed specifically to return mankind to the Moon is still slated to do so sometime in the latter part of 2025 or 2026. This voyage will partially be made possible with the help Intuitive Machines has already provided and will provide in the future. The company recently announced a $117 million contract to deliver six different payloads to the Moon for NASA.

This is still just the beginning. Analysts believe growing interest in Moon trips will drive enough revenue growth for Intuitive Machines to push it out of the red and into the black by 2026. Reaching that milestone could easily send this stock on a rocket ride, so to speak.

Blue Origin New Glenn,"Imo this is the only major near term challenge for RKLB in terms of stock price. Per management, Blue is targeting 10 launches in 2025 and 20+ in 2026. Now that's obviously optimistic but given that New Shepherd has been successful (suborbital), it seems likely that Blue has the ability to reach orbit successfully. Whether it's 2025 or 2026, at some point pretty soon they'll be launching NG at decent cadence. Different from Stoke or Relativity which are doing interesting things but hasn't proven to to be able to go orbital which is as hard as making an engine (or harder). Most of these launches will be for Kuiper now and going forward so there's plenty of business left for Neutron. I'm not worried about that. But I do think that the probable success of New Glenn is a potential overhang on RKLB stock price appreciation. Thoughts?",9,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fj7arb/blue_origin_new_glenn/

Why I am staying put through the end of year in Rocketlab,"We are reaching the end of quarter. There is one more launch this week. With that being successful, we meet all expectations. Even this launch fails it's not a big deal. We have seen both failures and resilience in Electron launches. Resilience is always rewarded.

  
Having said that, we are going to next quarter with strong tailwinds and no headwinds.

1. Increase in backlog or positive commentary on future launch opportunities 
2. These will be, well choreographed presentations. Very little risk
   1. Stage 1 static fire
   2. Stage 2 static fire
   3. Final Integration
   4. Wet Dress Rehearsal

Any positive announcement would be a catalyst for the stock to take off. **Optimism** is also a catalyst to drive higher.

HASTE price tag?,"The other day Adam Spice mentioned the HASTE missions are the quickest growing stream in the electron portfolio.  I find this to be a very difficult business stream to get info on (I recognize many of the missions are confidential which may be why).  Does anyone know:
1) how much rocket lab charges for HASTE missions?  I’m guessing more than the $8.2m per launch for a standard electron rocket. 
2) exactly what the purpose of these missions is? It doesn’t seem like they’re payload missions deploying satellites for clients. I see many times they are defense-oriented but does anyone know exactly what that means? Are they ultimately going to be used as hypersonic missiles?  Testing for missile defense?  Don’t understand the use case for HASTE from the client side.

Question,"I live in Korea and in Korean sites, a number of people are concerned about RKLB because Trump said he will appoint Elon as ‘government efficiency commission’ if he becomes president.

Basically, they are worried because according to them(Koreans) Peter allegedly said that Elon is trying to suppress competitors like Rocket Lab in this field and that he is interfering w RKLB’s foothold in the industry by doing things such as lowering the launch price of the small-mounted vehicles etc.

As a result, Koreans w RKLB stocks are concerned about Trump being president since if Elon Musk takes up the government position, there is a very high possibility that he will use legal methods to push Spacex and suppress the competitions like Rocket Lab (according to them).

I want to ask if this is substantiated or just over-speculation/conspiracy by Koreans since I haven’t seen people in this Sub talk about this(or maybe you guys did and I didn’t see it).

Idk a lot of Koreans seem to be focusing on how to debate would affect the stock market, especially with Tesla and Elon related stocks and I’m curious if it’s a reasonable thing to do.",56,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fe7pcs/question/

The Intangibles are important - and its looking better for Rocket Lab,"I kinda feel sorry for SpaceX lately.  They have done some fantastic engineering and I’m sure have a lot of great people but their CEO and 50% owner has become a huge distraction.  The new private space race is in its infancy so a good head start isn’t enough.  Maintaining superiority in an industry over decades is difficult.  Do you know how many auto manufactures didn’t make it?  If you want to see what negative publicity can do to a superior product, go read the story of Preston Tucker or watch the movie.  

If Musk had just kept the problem to X, it would probably be fine but now he is using Starlink to defy the Brazilian Government.  I know that their government involved Starlink first but instead of backing down he is doubling down.  This could have long term ramifications if worldwide governments think Musk has no respect for their laws and start to put laws in place to limit his power in their countries.  I can guarantee these discussions are happening.  

The other problem for SpaceX now is their CEO decided to bet on one horse instead of just remaining neutral.  If his horse loses, there is no way he will see support from a Harris/Walz administration.  Musk is posting pictures of Harris as a Russian General…such a dumb move if you really want government contracts. I’m sure there are people in SpaceX that have left or are thinking of leaving because they don’t want to work for Musk anymore.  Again….that will benefit Rocket lab and Blue Origin and maybe a few of the other startups looking to scale quickly.

Blue Origin and Rocket Lab are poised to take advantage of these missteps by Musk.  That is why you see nothing about the election from Bezos and Beck because they are much smarter and know that to overtake SpaceX at this point you just put your head down and do the work.  There isn’t any need to attack Musk…he is lighting himself on fire.",207,25,https://i.redd.it/y80va2ienlmd1.jpeg

With a market cap of sub 30 mm this would not be an expensive acquisition. Mynaric cannot and will not go out of business as they are extremely important to SDA.

Is this time different? (Dramatic positive price action followed by sell off),"I have watched profit bleed away several times on this stock. Over 25k on separate moves IF I sold and bought back (below my current 4.62 average). 

I haven’t sold and have simply kept adding. Up to 4475 shares now.

Seeing profit drift away is obv lame.

I haven’t sold because I was looking for a special company. I think I found it in rocket lab. 

I am tempted to sell now as I’m sure so many of us are. 

I’m not selling because Rocket Lab will be worth 20bil eventually. I have no doubt. I don’t think it’s going straight there now, but someday far in the future 40$ shares is fully reasonable (if the company realizes ambitions).

I have read absolutely everything there is to know about the company and people (many of the board members, especially like Beck as a person and Spice is also nice- he was CFO for Qualcomm (I believe, please correct me if I’m wrong, but he does have experience in the semi / chips industry and space chips (even if only for solar cells (which I don’t think they are). I think they are making and developing chips for satellite operation / control and other various space craft in future))

Regardless of the semis / chips, the other aspects of the company are all notably exceptional. There are 4 ish various space craft at the moment (see video where Beck introduces the new names, it is funny) 

YouTube search “Rocket Lab Spacecraft Family” link: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AxEMnB9m-uw

 They have small launch fairly nailed, but more valuable and fully overlooked / not priced in is the “space systems” sector. Space companies that operate just satellites (like Iridium and ASTS) have market caps that dwarf Rocket Lab. Rocket Lab does what they do too… 

A little personal background…
Rocket Lab is 5% of my investment $ (in addition to a teacher’s pension). I have 215k in a tax deferred annuity that collects 7% fixed return. 24% of my pay goes directly into the annuity. RKLB is a 20k$ investment with money iI don’t spend every couple weeks. RKLB is very high risk I am not looking with rose colored glasses. There are many risks (Not worried about losing it all because I have the fixed return account…

Anyway, i can’t pull myself to sell this time or after any rise in share price (will sell 1000 shares at 28.50.  now, I could take 11k profit…. That just isn’t why I’m here. 

Say less, I know.

Rocket Lab Owns 2/3 of the U.S. Launch Market -- That Isn't SpaceX,"https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/rocket-lab-owns-2-3-120000860.html

When Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB) reported second-quarter earnings last week, it ignited a multiday rally that sent its stock price soaring as much as 18%. And no wonder.

Sales at the small space rocket manufacturer soared 71% year over year, beating analyst forecasts. The per-share loss for the quarter was $0.08 -- not great -- but still better than the $0.10 loss that Wall Street forecast.

A historic quarter

In fact, Chief Executive Officer Peter Beck said Q2 was Rocket Lab's ""highest revenue quarter in company history"" -- no great surprise given that each succeeding quarter shows revenue growth. But Beck also said that Rocket Lab is seeing ""strong and growing demand for our launch services and space systems products,"" such as the Electron rocket, Photon kick stage spacecraft, and satellites built for the U.S. Space Force. The company is also making progress on new products to power profit in the future.

First and foremost among these are the new Neutron rocket, a medium-lift rocket that, in a unique twist on traditional design, encapsulates its second stage within a reusable first stage with an integrated (and also reusable) payload fairing.

In last week's press release, Rocket Lab highlighted the recent successful first hot fire test of the Archimedes engine, nine of which will be used to power Neutron's first stage. Four days later, Rocket Lab posted a ""how it started, how it's going"" photo comparison on X first showing CEO Beck standing next to a mockup of the then-just-announced Neutron concept vehicle, side by side with a completed half-fairing for a real-life Neutron rocket.

What's more, just one day earlier, Rocket Lab announced its 10th mission so far this year, the launch of a Capella Space satellite to orbit atop an Electron rocket. Crucially, this was the first launch for Capella since September 2023, when an anomaly in an Electron rocket's second stage resulted in a loss of the payload. The fact that Capella maintained its faith in Rocket Lab -- and that faith was vindicated with a successful launch over the weekend -- has to come as happy news for Rocket Lab shareholders.

SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and ULA -- in that order

So yes, it's been a busy few days for Rocket Lab, and jam-packed with good news. Now here's some less good news.

According to Beck, Rocket Lab's Electron has become ""the most frequently launched small rocket globally."" And so far this year, Rocket Lab is responsible for ""64% of all non-SpaceX orbital U.S. launches in 2024 to date."" That sounds impressive, but it comes with a big caveat. SpaceX orbital U.S. launches already number 79 (and probably more by the time this article publishes). Meanwhile, Rocket Lab's 64% amounts to only 10 launches total.

That actually gives you a better idea of the distance between No. 2 rocket launcher Rocket Lab and No. 3 United Launch Alliance (ULA has launched four times this year, making up about 28% of non-SpaceX orbital U.S. launches), than of how close Rocket Lab is to overtaking SpaceX.

Hint: It's not even close. For the foreseeable future, the great American space race is going to remain with SpaceX as No. 1, then a big gap with everybody else.

The race for No. 2

Investors also need to be aware that Rocket Lab faces some serious competition even in the race to remain No. 2 to SpaceX.

Don't get me wrong. Rocket Lab is accelerating its launch cadence. Its revenue is accelerating. And there's a very real chance Rocket Lab will turn profitable in the next year or two. Still, now that United Launch Alliance has its new Vulcan rocket operational, it's moving quickly to regain its traditional role as one of America's leading launch companies. As I pointed out earlier this month, ULA currently has 23 Vulcan rockets in various stages of construction, and ULA CEO Tory Bruno is promising investors he will launch 20 times next year, and 25 times in 2026.

With 10 launches under its belt already in 2024, and more on the way, Rocket Lab could still out-launch ULA, and remain America's No. 2 launch provider in the future. But ULA is definitely going to try and give Rocket Lab a run for its money.",155,13,https://i.redd.it/h1c1fwpaemkd1.jpeg

FAQ for RKLB For new WSB people (fixed) thanks chatGPT,"**What do they sell?**  
Rockets, satellites, hardware, and software.

**How were they listed?**  
SPAC. They had a peak at $18.

**Who is the CEO?**  
Sir Peter Beck.

**Wait, the CEO is knighted?**  
Yes, he's a New Zealander.

**Wait, the CEO of a significant aerospace company is a New Zealander?**  
Yeah, that's why it's unusual. It shows his intelligence in achieving something no one expected.

**Who are their competitors?**  
SpaceX, Blue Origin, Firefly, Stoke, and technically Astra.

**Wait, I only know two of those.**  
Two have never launched, and two haven't launched for ages.

**Wait, didn't one of those companies also get listed and then delisted?**  
Astra did that, and Virgin Orbit too, until they filed for Chapter 11.

**Ok, cool. What are Rocket Lab's competitive advantages over SpaceX and Blue Origin?**  
With Electron, smaller satellites that need to be launched sooner and to closer locations can be cheaper and more profitable over time compared to delays.

**Wait, why does their revenue recognition change so often over quarters?**  
Revenue for launches can only be recognized at launch, with 90% paid by launch day.

**How many launches are needed on Electron per year to be profitable?**  
Around 21.

**Wait, they didn’t launch that many per year.**  
First, consider revenue recognition. Delays are primarily on the client side.

**What is Neutron?**  
A significant new rocket that can lift up to 13 metric tons.

**How much does R&D for this cost?**  
It's supposed to be around $300 million. It might cost more.

**Wait, that’s a lot.**  
Yes, but relatively speaking, it's cheap. The Falcon 9 cost around $390 million in 2011.

**When will it launch?**  
Mid next year.

**How far along are they in development?**  
They've tested the engine.

**What about their other business activities?**  
Are they doing recovery?  
Soon.

**I’m glad you asked about satellites and space systems. These are high-revenue lines, profiting under SolAero and Sinclair, and selling carbon composites.**

**What do those do?**  
Star trackers, ion propulsion, solar panels, separation systems, and solar panels.

**How did they acquire these companies?**  
M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions).

**Wait, that’s like shopping for companies?**  
Yes, it's hinted that they may buy something for a new constellation.

**Who are their customers?**  
NASA, DOD, Space Force, and commercial customers.

**Wait, the financial statements say they’ve got convertible notes.**  
Yes, they have debt that can become shares.

What many people miss about Rocket Lab,"I have seen a lot of posts on here and WSB that only discuss the launch side of Rocket Lab.

Rocket Lab is not just a launch company. They are way more than that. They are an end to end space company.

Take a look at these scenarios below.

Company X( basically all companies that need something in space to operate. Use ASTS for example): These companies design and build something that operates in space, but rely on another company to get their equipment there.

SpaceX: launch provider with an emphasis on launching their own constellation with further goals in space. We all know they can launch themselves.

Rocket Lab: started as a launch only company with Electron but have heavily diversified their business into space systems. Their business offers the ability to design, build, launch and operate a customers satellites or space craft or maybe their own constellation someday. This is why it is called end to end. Their business is not launch, launch is only one of their tools to more effectively do business in space. Neutron will not make or break this company. They do not rely in its success to make them profitable. They could stop development today and still be profitable in the future due to the way they have positioned themselves in the industry through their space system business segments. This type of position is going to be huge in the future as more people move their business into space.

I have followed this company for 3 years and they continue to impress me. Though launch is a very exciting part of this business, since it is really the only one we can see, I encourage every investor here to start viewing this company as an all around space company instead of just a launch company.

Rocket Lab Acquisition / Constellation Analysis,"# Hey r/RKLB, just wanted to share some analysis I've been doing on potential acquisition targets.

Rocket Lab's track record with acquisitions follows a fairly well-defined pattern. Let's take a look at the companies they have purchased thus far:

* **SolAero Technologies** - $80m - Dec '21 - Provider of high performance solar panels - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-space-solar-power-products-company-solaero-holdings-inc/)
* **Planetary System Corp (PSC)** - $42m + 1.7m shares - Dec '21 - Provider of separation systems - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-space-hardware-company-planetary-systems-corporation/)
* **Advanced Solutions Inc (ASI)** - $40m - Oct '21 - Flight software, mission sim, and guidance + nav software - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-acquires-space-software-company-advanced-solutions-inc/)
* **Sinclair Interplanetary** - $ Unknown - Apr - '20 - Satellite components (reaction wheels, star trackers, etc) - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-satellite-hardware-manufacturer-sinclair-interplanetary/)

Here is a section of an interview with CEO Peter Beck explaining the methodology behind Rocket Lab's acquisitions: [https://youtu.be/T\_\_1ubfs\_iE?t=1313](https://youtu.be/T__1ubfs_iE?t=1313)

* ""If the supply chain can not provide us the surety to deliver what we need, then we’ll go and vertically integrate""
* “If it’s too expensive and it’s too slow, generally we need to own it because we can make it cheaper and faster”
* ""Is this going to be strategically important to us in the future for stuff that we think we're going to do""

To summarize, Rocket Lab's acquisitions have all been vertical integration plays; bringing some aspect of their supply chain in house to either reduce lead times, unit cost, or both. Peter has mentioned in multiple interviews that all of these companies have scaled and integrated successfully into Rocket Lab's business.

Note how most of these acquisitions support the production and manufacturing of satellite **buses**. A quick review: satellites can be described as being comprised of a **bus** and a **payload.**

**Bus** - the main structure and infrastructure of a satellite, providing the necessary support systems for the payload to operate effectively. It includes power, structure, solar panels, propulsion, thermal control, attitude control, communication, and on-board computer systems.

**Payload** - the primary instrumentation or equipment on a satellite that performs the specific mission or function, such as sensing, communication, or experimentation, and is the reason the satellite is launched into space.  
  

Rocket Lab can currently produce satellite buses quickly, cost effectively, and at scale. Payloads? Not so much. 

# I think Rocket Lab's next acquisition will be a payload company. A company that specializes communications equipment, imaging/sensors, etc.

It's been clearly communicated by leadership that Rocket Lab plans on building a LEO constellation. If/when they do announce an acquisition of a payload company, we will be able to make some pretty big assumptions about the type of constellation they will build.

I do not think Rocket Lab will build out a direct to consumer mega constellation a la Starlink or Kuiper based on the following:

* Starlink's original estimated cost to design, build and deploy was $10 Billion  [source](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/05/block-5-spacex-increase-launch-cadence-lower-prices/)
* Amazon reportedly invested $10 Billion in the Kuiper project in 2020 [source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/fcc-authorizes-amazon-to-build-kuiper-satellite-internet-network.html)
* Comments from CFO Adam Spice :

>""the broadband from space application that SpaceX targeted with Starlink, that's probably not what we will be going for just given the amount of capital required"" [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=1059)

>""but there's lots of very interesting applications that required dozens or hundreds of satellites not 40 thousand satellites"" [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=1070)

While it's possible they could pursue a smaller 5G constellation similar to AST SpaceMobile, I think AST's tech moat is wide enough that other opportunities make more sense.

# I think it's likely that we see a smaller 100-200 satellite constellation purpose built and marketed towards military applications.

These satellites could provide access to a suite of sensors, communication systems, radar, antennas, etc., and deliver tailored services to DoD customers. A few points supporting that:

* Rocket Lab is prime DoD contractor as of Dec '23, acting as prime for the $515m SDA Tranche 2 Transport Layer - Beta contract. According to Adam Spice this:

>""opens up a lot of opportunities for us"" .. ""we think it's a huge enabler to grow that government exposure"".  [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=515)

* Sitting Board member Nina Armagno, among many other things, **was the first director of staff of the United States Space Force** and was responsible for helping to establish the organizational framework, policies and procedures, building relationships with other branches, etc.  [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/about/team/)
* The business is already heavily focused on gov customers. SDA, ESCAPADE, HASTE, CAPSTONE, TROPICS, etc, all make up a huge chunk of rocket lab's revenue already.

# Ok. So if it's likely that the acquisition is a payload company, and it's likely that the payload would be for a constellation built for servicing DoD customers, I think I know where to look...

# [Here is a list of subcontractors that Rocket Lab selected to help fulfill the SDA contract](https://spaceimpulse.com/2024/05/07/rocket-lab-selects-subcontractors-for-sda-satellite-constellation/#:~:text=The%20selected%20subcontractors%20include%20CesiumAstro,Redwire%20Space%2C%20and%20Parsons%20Corporation)

What do you know, a bunch of **payload** companies (mostly).

* **CesiumAstro** - $260-390m [source](https://app.dealroom.co/companies/cesiumastro) - will provide its Vireo active electronically scanned array (AESA) radio frequency (RF) communications payload, known as the first multi-beam-capable Ka-band communications system for SDA’s PWSA.
* **Mynaric** - $93m Mkt Cap - will supply CONDOR Mk3 optical communication terminals, enhancing free space optical communications for air, space, and mobile applications.
* **Redwire Space** - 450m Mkt Cap - has been chosen for its expertise in antennas and RF hardware.
* **Parsons Corp** - 10b Mkt Cap - will provide the NEBULA Operations – Vendor Architecture (NOVA), serving as Rocket Lab’s ground system for the operational management of its 18 satellites.
* **SEAKR Engineering** - Acquired by Raytheon - will offer its Tactical Satellite Communications (TACSATCOM) Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Network Encryption System (NES).
* **Collins Aerospace** - Acquired by Safran Group -  is set to deliver the waveform necessary for the SDR, essential software and firmware for TACSATCOM’s transmission and reception.

# Cash Situation

Rocket Lab's current Cash and Equivalents and marketable securities etc is $546.8m ([source - slide 37](https://s28.q4cdn.com/737637457/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/FINAL-Rocket-Lab-Q2-2024-Earnings-Presentation.pdf))

All the previous acquisitions have been in the $40-80m range (Sinclair likely less)

Adam Spice gave guidance in the Q2 '24 earnings call that capex for Neutron R&D was expected to tick up in the in the second half of 2024 [source](https://youtu.be/lE9SPN_bIhc?t=3634)

Adam Spice on whether they would do another cap raise - ""Right now we don't see anything that would cause us to go back to capital markets"" but did provide a caveat that for the right opportunity, it's a possibility [source](https://youtu.be/lE9SPN_bIhc?t=5751)

So it's not likely they would raise capital for an acquisition, but it's also not off the table.

Obviously the last three subcontractors on the list aren't an option, and $450m for Redwire seems a bit steep given the cash on hand. **Mynaric** and **CesiumAstro** both fit the profile and around the price range we are looking for.

Do I think one of these companies will be acquired by Rocket Lab? **I don't know**.

Do I think a company *like* Mynaric or CesiumAstro will be acquired by Rocket Lab? **Yes.**

Here's a few predictions:

* I think the first constellation Rocket Lab builds will be less than 200 satellites
* I think it will be purpose built to serve the DoD, possibly partnering with a branch to actually fund the first tranche of satellites
* If there is an acquisition, I feel very confident that it will be a payload company
* Without a cap raise, I think $100m is the most we could afford to spend on an acquisition (assuming no Neutron delays etc)

# TL;DR I don't know if/who they will acquire but wrote this as a framework to (hopefully) start a discussion anchored around the type and size company I think fits the bill.",101,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1evtjur/rocket_lab_acquisition_constellation_analysis/

Some thoughts ,"Hi RKLB family,

I've decided to buy some stock after doing research. I won't be buying a lot due to limited funds (poverty)

Given the recent price jump, likely due to hype and FOMO I plan to wait for a potential dip in the coming days before investing. Hopefully, I won't end up buying at a high price like $10.

I believe in Rocket Lab's potential in the space industry but also want to be cautious about when I enter my position. Honestly, one thing that I realized that it would be wise in the future to hold some stock so when the hype train arrives I could sell some and then buy more after it mellows out.",22,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1euo8d4/some_thoughts/
Everyday Astronaut video about New Glenn,"This post is actually about Rocket Lab & Neutron, not a Blue Origin advertisement.

I really highly recommend watching Everyday Astronaut’s latest YouTube video with Jeff Bezos & New Glenn Factory. It confirmed three things I’ve personally thought are Rocket Labs clear advantages with Neutron.

1. Carbon composite gives you best performance and is clearly the best material choice. Downside to this is iterating the rocket design is not realistic so you have to get it right with the first design. Rocket Lab already did exactly this with Electron.

2. Reusable fairings attached to the 1st stage are an excellent idea to reduce cost.

3. If you can make the 2nd stage cheap enough, you will never have to deal with the problems that a reusable 2nd stage will have. Blue Origin is also attempting this. They’re (in parallel) designing a reusable 2nd stage and another ”as cheap as possible” expendable 2nd stage. Bezos said if they can make the expendable 2nd stage very cheap, then it doesn’t make economical sense to attempt to reuse it. 

What are these 2nd stage problems I mentioned? Look at what Starship has to deal with on re-entry. Combine that with the extra weight of the stainless steel, fuel, heat shielding that is required to make it reusable. That’s weight that could be used to deliver extra payload to orbit. (I know I know, Starship is designed for interplanetary travel etc. so re-entry is a requirement)

Rocket Lab is purely going for a 2nd stage that is as cheap and as light as possible. I think this will prove to be the right choice. There’s a lot of reasons why and are mostly related to economics and performance of the overall vehicle.

For example the empty weight for the 2nd stage of a Falcon 9 is 3900kg. Peter Beck has stated the 2nd stage of Neutron is roughly the same weight as a Harley Davidson motorcycle so around 300-400kg. That’s a big difference.

After watching the video I have a lot more respect for Jeff Bezos & Blue Origin. On a related note, Blue Origin is scheduled to launch two spacecraft built by Rocket Lab to Mars next month (unless there’s a delay)",49,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1eufya5/everyday_astronaut_video_about_new_glenn/
Do you think Starship will leave enough space for RKLB to prosper?,"I've been following spacenews for some years now and decided I would like to invest in RKLB. I agree with probably all of you here that RKLB is the strongest competitor for Nr 2 spot for biggest space company atm. What got me kind of concerned is just how big Starship might get. Do you think that a fully reusable rocket might just take up too many potential orders? It is a huge step from partial reusability to full reusability. Any thoughts?

Edit: Thanks for all the Insight y'all",10,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1eurds2/do_you_think_starship_will_leave_enough_space_for/
Simple DD for Newcomers.,"RKLB builds satellites and rockets currently it has operational Electron small launch rocket with over 50 launches. They are working on a big rocket called Neutron which will be Reusable. As well as a suite of various satellites.

What is a reusable rocket and why is it important?

Most rockets ever to exist have been expendable, meaning they get destroyed or become museum peices. Imagine the cost of an airplane ticket if you had to build a 747 airplane fly across the world and trash the 747 every time. That's basically what humanity did until SpaceX proved it was possible to land rockets with Falcon 9. The concept has been proven. Rocket Lab along with a few others are chasing this dream. Since SpaceX landed Falcon 9 and became reusable no one has been able to duplicate this and the company is now worth 210 billion market cap, they are in first place a huge leap ahead of everyone.

Furthermore, Rocket Lab builds the satellites for many of the launches, satellite components and has a huge space systems division and sells a service, which means they scoop up way more profit margin. They are far ahead all others (excluding SpaceX) and plan to launch the first Neutron mid 2025 and will become profitable shortly after. 

Neutron will be designed to be reusable from day 1 where Falcon 9 was not which will give them a big advantage in design. 

RKLB is only valued around 3.2 billion to SpaceXs 210 billion. Pennies on the dollar and most agree it is wildly undervalued right now. 

So, proof of concept has been established by SpaceX, Rocket Lab has tons of space and launch experience with their Electron Rocket being the second most frequently launched rocket. They have hundreds of millions in cash reserves to finish the development, the Archimedes engine that powers Neutron has just fired up for the first time recently after 3 yesrs of hard work and engines are the longest lead time in building a rocket. No other company is in a more perfect position to become and remain the #2 space company in the world. Once Neutron is successful and launching, this company should easily be worth 20-50 billion dollars ($45-$100 stock price) fair value still a fraction of SpaceX, they will be able to launch their own mega satellite constellations.

The CEO and Founder Peter Beck is an absolute genius, self taught rocket scientist and has been regarded as such by many influential people in the industry.

The meme potential is fun and could be nice, the fundamental potential... the sky is the limit.

Will RKLB's share price double this year? - Re-revisiting my post from 2024/04/29,"Today, on 2024/08/16, RKLB reached $7.10, more than doubling from its YTD low of $3.47 on 2024/04/16. Hell yeah!

  
[My old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cfjtco/will_rklbs_share_price_double_this_year/) from 2024/04/29 follows below:

RKLB share price has a history of doubling from its low during the summer and then falling down to repeat the process next year. So far, it has happened every and each year since its listing on the stock market:

* **2021: $9.5 to $21.34 from 2021/08/27 to 2021/09/09**
* **2022: $3.53 to $7.15 from 2022/06/30 to 2022/08/12**
* **2023:** **$3.76 to $8.05 from 2023/05/09 to 2023/07/19**

The 2024 low has been reached on 2024/4/16 at $3.47. What has changed from previous years besides the company's increased performance is that **the reported short interest YTD has increased by 161% from 22m to 58m shorted shares**. This huge increase right before the summer may cause a bound of a violent volatility once the 2024 doubling commences.

RKLB trades so cheaply and it is so heavily shorted that all that may be needed to revalue its stock is a shift in sentiment. Right now the stock is pricing in the most bearish of bearish outcomes. Delayed Neutron development, increased R&D costs and Electron's obsolescence. But Rocket Lab is the only space company dedicated to being a one stop shop for space applications. Suppose over this year, the management can craft a narrative that Neutron is really coming this year/early next year and with it a significant decrease in R&D costs and the growth and capture of launch and space system markets. Such sentiment shift may take time but I don't know, there are so many unusual factors with Rocket Lab that I could see it happening rapidly.

I am not betting that Rocket Lab is going to stage the most epic growth of all time. I am just betting on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06).
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year.

Peter Beck and Rocket Lab have an opportunity…and seem to be playing it right.,"This isn’t to get too political…it’s about business but also how politics plays an important role in the success of space focused companies.  Everyone here knows that Space X is the current leader in the industry.  They have a solid infrastructure, some good engineers, and have done a great job so far.  They got an early lead and were well on their way to being the leader for decades to come.  Something similar could be said for Tesla.  However, in the early stages in a new industry, big mistakes can be extremely costly.  In the case of Tesla, the focus on the cybertruck and electric semi’s has cost a fair amount of Cap ex and no revenue.  Cybertrucks are sitting on lots and in fields and if you follow the Reddit r/cyberstuck you can see that they are basically hot garbage.  Teslas were incredibly successful at first but the constant price decreases and increases have turned some people off from buying again.  On top of that, and more importantly, Musk himself has alienated his largest consumer base with his anti-California, anti-lgbtq, etc…nonsense.  If there is one thing most successful CEOs will say is keep your loyal customers happy.  Tesla’s share of EV sales has dropped from 75% in 2022 to just under 50% in 2024.  

But, this is about Rocket Lab.  Space companies are going to continue to rely on government contracts along with the private sector.  For U.S. contracts, the company has to be based in the U.S. and meet specific security requirements.  There are only a couple of companies that can do that.  Over the next decade, the space industry should see phenomenal growth.  One company will not provide all the services.  The contracts will be split between multiple companies.  When it comes time to award those contracts, ability and consistency will play a huge role and also reputation.  Beck has done a fantastic job of being politically neutral.  He just gets the job done.  Musk on the other hand has decided to back one horse whole-heartedly and there will be a price to pay for that.  If his candidate loses, along with the trepidation congress already feels about how much power and influence he already has, it could be an opportunity for Rocket Lab to grow with huge contracts.  They just have to get Neutron to be successful.  If Kuniper turns out to have better technology then Starlink and if ASTS technology takes market share since a lot of people just want their phone to work in remote areas and not carry around an entire dish, then that could slow Starlink growth.  Space X will continue to be successful due to Starship but they are not guaranteed the top spot forever now.

Post-Neutron profitability ,"Given that Space X and Blue Origin either have or are developing larger rockets than Neutron, I wonder if Rocket Lab will need to start developing a larger rocket than Neutron in order to compete.

Rocket Lab Stock Soars. Space Has Momentum.

Commercial space company Rocket Lab RKLB 12.58% posted stronger quarterly sales Thursday evening, sending shares soaring. Rocket Lab, like Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has space launch and satellite-building capabilities. SpaceX, of course, is dominant, launching almost 80 times so far in 2024. Rocket Lab has launched nine times. Investors don’t get regular quarterly updates from Musk’s privately held space company. That isn’t the case with publicly traded Rocket Lab. For the second quarter, Rocket Lab reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, of negative $21 million from sales of just over $106 million. Wall Street was looking for an Ebitda loss of $26 million from sales of just under $106 million. Better cost control, resulting in a smaller-than-expected loss, is a positive. So are higher sales. Rocket Lab’s second-quarter sales grew about 15% compared with the first quarter and more than 70% year over year. The results sent Rocket Lab shares up about 12.6% in Friday trading to $5.37 apiece. The S&P 500 SPX 0.47% and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA 0.13% gained 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively. Following the report, Stifel analyst Erik Rasmussen wrote that launch demand remains strong and that sales should jump higher in the fourth quarter following relatively flat third-quarter sales of between $100 and $105 million. Rasmussen projects $121 million in fourth-quarter sales, up more than 100% year over year. He projects 2025 sales of about $576 million, up 36% from expected 2024 sales. Rasmussen projects positive Ebitda for the company in 2026, after sales hit almost $1 billion. He rates Rocket Lab shares Buy and has a $9 price target for the stock. Through Friday trading, Rocket Lab shares were down about 4% year to date.Shares of space start-up Virgin Galactic SPCE 2.16% are down about 87% this year, despite a 14% jump on Thursday. The company reported second-quarter sales of $4.2 million on Wednesday evening. Wall Street was looking for $3.4 million. Galactic focuses, of course, on space tourism. While better-than-expected sales are positive, ramping up capacity has been harder than the company expected. Rocket Lab has had more success providing launch services for companies looking to deploy small satellites into low-earth orbit. Coming into Friday trading, Galactic’s market capitalization was below $200 million. Rocket Lab’s was north of $2.3 billion. SpaceX dwarfs them both. It’s valued at some $200 billion in private markets.

_____________________________________________________

Rocket Lab had another successful launch this morning.   Just watched them successfully deploy the Capella satellite.  I think we see $10 by the end of the year.  I also think there might be more consolidation in the space industry.  Everyone knows that to compete with Musk you have to grow as fast as possible.  I wouldn’t be surprised to see more U.S. government contracts announced for Rocket Lab.  Boeing has really dropped the ball with leaving the astronauts stuck in space.  They are not getting any contracts until they bring them home unless one of their paid servants in congress really pushes for more money for Boeing.  If two of the big companies don’t combine in the next 12 months I’ll be surprised.  ",98,48,https://i.redd.it/rgqb4oh2o1id1.jpeg

"Manifest Space interview with Andy Lapsa, Stoke Space CEO (2024-07-25)","As another up and coming potential competitor to Rocket Lab, I thought people might find this interview from a couple of weeks ago worth listening to:

https://open.spotify.com/episode/3IpviNvEIcPEIQr6mrFIoB?si=IDhsKoiHR8mzJ0HN1i7r_Q

Given Stoke are aiming to be a launch only company at this point, I don't think the threat from these guys is too much at this point in time, although Andy did make a comment in the interview that I took as a bit of a sign that they're aiming to progress beyond launch, once they've got launch itself nailed down.

For those who don't know, Stoke are the company aiming to create a fully and rapidly reusable medium lift rocket (on the lower side of medium lift) called Nova. That might sound unlikely for a startup to achieve, but I've got a huge amount of respect for this company and the founders already.

First of all because they just sound like they know what they're doing, but also and probably more importantly because:

- They've already built and started testing a full flow staged combustion cycle engine in just a couple of years since first funding (an insane achievement)
- They've got an actual (and innovative) plan for how to make their second stage reusable, with a novel engine and actively cooled heatshield design
- On top of that they've also been testing development hardware already (doing hop tests) for that second stage

They are privately funded, not a public company to invest in, but I definitely think they're one to keep an eye on, if for no other reason than to keep an eye on as a Rocket Lab competitor (though they seem to be doing an awesome enough job that I'm just interested in seeing what they do anyway).

They aim for first launch at the end of 2025, so around the same time as Neutron.",34,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1ep33m5/manifest_space_interview_with_andy_lapsa_stoke/
First time RKLB has ever reported a net increase in Current Assets,"I'm sure a good amount of you caught this, but in all the excitement around record revenue/growth, the successful hot fire, the neutron infrastructure updates, etc, I missed something.

Except they did last quarter. This really surprised me, I expected to see a similar quarter over quarter decrease typical to any quarter since the SPAC merger.

Total current assets as well as cash & equivalents + marketable securities combined are slightly higher this quarter than last.

Is this the start of a trend? I'm skeptical for now. CFO Adam Spice mentioned an increase in capex through the next 3-4 quarters tapering off in Q2 '25 as the first neutron launch approaches. That mixed with the lower expected launch revenue in Q3, I wouldn't be too surprised to see the downtrend resume, at least in the near term.

I still found this encouraging and thought it was worth a share.

I have done some analysis on potential acquisition targets, let me know if that's something you'd like to see, happy to share.

My point is not that we will 6x from here, nor that we are guaranteed to succeed. I am also not dismissing the fact that most hyper-growth companies that failed had investors saying such things. 

However, in all the FOMO we keep experiencing, I just want everyone to remember that ASTS bulls suffered for years before seeing these monstrous gains. Yet, even in the steady bleeding, they maintained the thesis and profited greatly.

My point is this: if you find yourself genuinely convinced that the market will, as with ASTS, “not only price in current potential, but also expected future potential,” then do not lose heart. ",20,17,https://i.redd.it/lofaao1x7jgd1.jpeg

Possible hot fire at NASA Stennis - analysis with NASA firms data.,"Firms (=Fire Information Resource Management System) uses satellites to determine potential wild fire locations. They do that by detecting abnormal heat signatures. It is near real time - about 3 hours delayed.

And the location of a fire at Stennis could not be more precise, it was right at the RocketLabs Stennis test stand. There was a fire detected on the 18th of July. Check out the link below.

The SPAC = bad argument...,"Some people argue that all SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) are bad or risky investments.  
  
While they have a point, they're missing the bigger picture. SPACs offer an easy way for companies to access public markets quickly and with less scrutiny. Naturally, this path attracts some questionable companies. However, what these critics overlook is that there are solid companies that have gone public via SPACs because it was a general trend, not because they are shady.

An interesting point to note is that the median return of the entire stock market is negative, with almost every sector, from healthcare to energy, following this trend (with the exception of finance, which has a neutral median return). Only a few stocks contribute to an overall positive average return. (Source: [https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/average-is-not-the-same-as-median](https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/average-is-not-the-same-as-median))

Therefore, SPACs failing or delivering negative returns isn't extraordinary; it's the norm.   
  
Most SPACs are in a worse position than when they went public, often having attempted and failed to launch their projects since their listing. 

However, this isn't the case with RocketLab.   
When RocketLab went public via a SPAC in August 2021, they had already launched 21 times in 4 years, had an annual revenue of $60 million, and their space systems side was just getting started. Now, they launch over 15 times per year, aim for over $400 million in annual revenue, secure constellation-level contracts and $0.5 billion satellite contracts, and we can see their Neutron hardware taking shape.

-> RocketLab is in a significantly better position than when they were listed. The share price does not show it, but the company got fundamentally better.

This is not financial advice, just a few thoughts I had when I saw a graphic about median stock returns.

Whitepaper for the reaction wheel manufacturing line,"Some interesting parts illuminating how RocketLab is saving manufacturing costs.

-""Multiple automated stations are used to burn in the electronics, assemble the rotors, wind the stators, and test the final assembled product""

-"" The reaction wheel has been designed with injection moulded parts""

- ""An automated piece of equipment has been developed which **undertakes a measurement of unbalance**, calculates the required material removal at discrete intervals, **and undertakes this removal**. The process can be iterated as required to achieve the required unbalance specification.""

With 100 reaction wheels per size per decade (Sinclair delivered a total of 360 reaction wheels to orbit before they got the big contract), you do not design and order an injection mold- you just CNC it because its cheaper.  
And you do not built a machine to automatically balance the rotors.

"Implied Volatility (IV) Skew for RKLB, unified for three approaching option expiration dates: August 2, August 9, and August 16","**Implied Volatility (IV):** IV is a measure of the market's forecast of a likely movement in a security's price. It often rises in bearish markets and falls in bullish markets, as higher IV corresponds to higher expected risk or uncertainty.

**IV Skew:** This shows the difference in IV across different strike prices for option contracts. Different IVs for different strikes reflects the market's expectations of the likelihood of different outcomes.

This skew is showing that the market is *positioning* and *hedging* for a large potential move up OR down within the coming weeks.

To be clear, this is to be taken with a grain of salt, the option chain is just one of many data inputs that investors should consider. But for what its worth, alongside the IV skew, **open interest** and **put/call volume** on the option chain are also quite bullish.

How to accelerate Rocket Lab's growth,"Rocket Lab has correctly positioned itself as a vertically-integrated player in the rapidly growing New Space economy. From components to systems, spacecraft, constellations, and through to launch, on-orbit operations, and space-based application solutions, Rocket Lab has built up the capability to “do what it says it’s going to do.” More importantly, as it has built up these capabilities, it’s done so with a success rate that approaches 100%. Rocket Lab does not fail, or at least hasn’t failed so far. As Beck is heard to say in Wild Wild Space, ""I’m not built to build shit.”

Yet there are tradeoffs to be made between organic growth and growth gained through acquisitions. Yes, building up capabilities in-house at a place like Rocket Lab ensures that the results meet and often exceed immediate and long-term requirements. Whereas the challenges of an acquisition include cultural fit and other integration challenges as well as inevitable product evolution to meet internal requirements. The biggest expense of internal development is the opportunity cost. Though an acquisition costs actual cash, you’re buying a capability that’s closer to market already.

While Rocket Lab has **capabilities**, it has limited **capacity**. The New Space economy is growing so fast that Rocket Lab doesn’t have enough time to hire the number of top-flight team members needed to grow their business from the inside. But the company’s anemic market cap makes it nearly impossible to acquire top-flight technologies to keep up with requirements, opportunities, and capacity.

As I see it, there are 4 possible scenarios that will allow the company to optimize growth and fully realize its potential:

1. The market must respond to Rocket Lab’s potential to such an extent that the market cap grows by multiples.
2. An outside equity investor must be found to invest $1 billion or more to fund acquisitions, but diluting existing investors in the process.
3. Rocket Lab must merge or even be acquired by another company with compatible capabilities/capacity and access to significant capital.
4. Rocket Lab can continue to grow organically with the opportunities and challenges it currently faces.

The market may give greater recognition to Rocket Lab once Neutron reaches orbit. But the stated scale up of launch cadence is incremental, spanning several years before it can deploy a constellation like the Falcon 9 is doing for StarLink. Even with a 70% annual growth rate, it’ll take many years to reach the scale implied by Peter Beck’s vision.

RKLB Share Price vs. Short Interest - Latest Update,"NASDAQ released the latest short interest in RKLB just a short while ago (dated 11/29/2024 when the SP was at the ATH of >$27).  Below is a graph showing plots of RKLB short interest (obtained from NASDAQ) overlaid with the corresponding day's share price (obtained from Fidelity) covering the previous 1 year and 15 days. The earnings call was the main driving force for the share price rocketing up.  Shorts were caught napping and they desperately had to scramble to cover their positions which probably drove the share price up even more to the new ATH of >$27. As a result, short interest decreased dramatically (\~20%) from the previous month. Short interest was still high at \~49.28 million shares short or \~13% of the float as of 11/29/2024. I think new shorts have since then opened new short positions (this is how shorts typically react after a massive price spike) and they’re heavily shorting the stock which is partially causing the downtrend in the share price.  The other reason for the downtrend in the share price is probably due to profit taking.  My thinking is that we will see share price consolidation in the $20 - 22 range at least in the near term.  What do y’all think?  Please share here.

Additionally, is there a clear timeline or roadmap for their future beyond the development of the Neutron rocket?",50,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1hb9gio/what_is_rocket_labs_secret_sauce_for_competing/
Actual Rocket Lab MSR Proposal Abstract,"I was curious about what Rocket Lab proposed to NASA that made them change their minds on giving them the study contract so I eventually dug enough and found the actual proposal abstracts doc here: https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=1007866/solicitationId=%7BBB8B4EA2-C11B-259D-65E7-E0ADFA57CE11%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/RASMSR24%20Abstracts_revised%208-27-24.pdf


I attached the relevant RKLB proposal abstract for the community’s easy access.

My read on this suggests me that RKLB really thought this through and proposed actual specific ideas and strategy whereas many other companies just threw buzzwords around.

I realize this is many years down the road, but for the long term share holders among us, RKLB is poised to take advantage of SBSP. I’m not necessarily saying they will have their own constellation, but after the CHIPS act allowing for their increased solar manufacturing capacity they will probably be providing solar cells for these projects.

Preferential treatment of SpaceX under Trump presidency,"Hi there,

I was analyzing my portfolio and was wondering what the effect of a trump presidency would mean for RKLB, since I would imagine SpaceX will absorb most of the government contracts due to Elon musk being in close ties with Trump. I'm thinking this will push RKLB to push for a more commercial approach and less relient on government contracts. 

What do you think? I will say that I believe since RKLB is a fair bit smaller than SpaceX at this point. I doubt anything will really happen in terms of competitivity from SpaceX, but I'm wondering how you see RKLB in this situation. It might as well be that this presidency opens up new opportunities in terms of Space exploration.

Space Systems Potential,"Spinning off a comment, on a post that may get deleted, I thought an interesting discussion might be had on the potential of the Space Systems side of Rocket Lab.

From one of the recent articles on the CHIPs award of $23.9 million to expand manufacturing capacity of space grade solar panels. 

“Polaris Market Research to estimate that the global satellite solar cell materials market size will grow to $111.46 billion by 2032 at a compound annual growth rate of 13.2%.“

**Edit: the Zack’s/Yahoo Finance article says billions, but I’ve been informed the actual Polaris Market Research says $111.46 million. I found other sources that say $1.1 billion for space solar by 2030. Either way, nowhere near the above do I edited this post. However, I still believe space systems as a whole will be a multi-billion dollar revenue stream in the coming years, just with less of that from solar than theorized above.**

We are all excited for the Neutron launch and joining the medium lift market, the increased revenue, the increased margin with reusability. And the fact it opens up the Space as a Service market with a constellation launched by Neutron… I definitely am.

However, I think Space Systems is too often ignored in the future potential for Rocket Lab. Space systems, the manufacturing side of the business with space grade solar panels, reaction wheels, separation systems, satellite manufacturing, spacecraft manufacturing, etc… access to that market is going to be absolutely huge over the next several years imo, and is going to be a huge revenue driver for Rocket Lab. The bad inherited contracts from the Solaero acquisition are pretty much done with, the company just received a CHIPs award to expand manufacturing capacity, and alongside the other parts of space systems, I really see this side of the company driving it into multi-billions of revenue pre-constellation revenue. It has an absolutely massive potential imo and could really crank revenue through the roof as the market grows over the next couple years. The Constellation for space as a service will just be the cherry on top at that point.

Thoughts?

I wouldn’t be surprised if SpaceX was worth more on the public markets than for the private investors.  Look how much the market has driven up Tesla and Nvidia on future earnings that are several years away.

Why I'm Holding till 2030 at least. My RKLB DD post.,"# Introduction

I’ve been following Rocket Lab since 2019, before it SPAC-ed in 2021. Having already known the company, I aped in following the SPAC announcement in the range of $12-$15. Slowly averaged down the cost through the SPAC-pocalypse. Average price probably in the range of $8-$10 not $4.78 as I changed brokers.

[Current position \~168,000 shares. \(\~140,000 shares are mine, the rest are held for family\) Have only trimmed \~10&#37; of shares in the recent run up as part of risk management, portfolio was 100&#37; in RKLB.](https://preview.redd.it/vn1prfwdko3e1.jpg?width=1093&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af5f6ad220bd27de3e600e6edb768f1ac71a63ae)

With the increase in stock price over the last few months and the increase in newcomers asking price target questions and new posts every time it hits a new round number, people asking if they should take profit as they expect a pull back to happen, there hasn’t been a proper DD post in awhile and I feel that many are not capturing the point that Sir Peter Beck's end goal for Rocket Lab is to be an **END-TO-END Space Company.** In my opinion it will be impossible to attribute a price target for $RKLB just simply because the industry is still in its infancy stage, instead, what is important is to see just how much of the growing space industry Rocket Lab could possibly capture in the next 5-10 years.

This is my own DD post and is not financial advise, I will attempt to cover and break down Rocket Labs business segments and why I will hold be a shareholder till 2030 and beyond.

[Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, spacecraft, satellite components, and on-orbit management - 2024 Q3 Earnings Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/xjvg1d975p3e1.jpg?width=1257&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fd1ccef8c9bea2cbd8d74e37fac398b64680181)

Although in the name, Rocket Lab is not just a launch provider, but an end-to-end space company providing, not just the launch service but also complete spacecraft design, manufacturing, satellite components and on-orbit management. Eventually, the company intends to use the experience to deliver and provide their own service from space through its own **satellite constellation**.

# Business Segments

**1. Electron**

[Electron is the only reusable orbital-class small rocket. Capturing and reflying Electron’s first stage enables higher launch frequency without expanding production and lowers launch costs.](https://preview.redd.it/okycitpk5p3e1.png?width=1345&format=png&auto=webp&s=453be91a7aad8274d7fef195c42eeb1daf48add2)

Electron is a two-stage, small-lift launch vehicle that is able to carry around 300kg to Low-Earth Orbit. Its Rutherford engines are the first electric-pump-fed engine to power an orbital-class rocket. Electron is often flown with a kick stage or Rocket Lab's Photon spacecraft. 

Proven Reliability – Electron has already flown 14 times this year, achieving record cadence, over the 10 times flown in 2023. Electron is now the 3rd most frequently launched rocket globally in 2024. 54 launches (50 successes, four failures \~ 92.5% success rate)

Responsiveness – Electron can launch from three launch pads across two hemispheres, from LC1 A/B in New Zealand, Rocket Lab’s privately owned launch pad or from LC2 in Wallops, Virginia. This has been demonstrated recently with a HASTE launch in LC2 and an electron launch within 24 hours on Nov 24/25.

[🚀 Literally to the Moon - Electron's Capstone Mission](https://preview.redd.it/hq5mcset5p3e1.png?width=1786&format=png&auto=webp&s=dee6c94313ff18c3c7a9c27bc28a84338d2094ac)

Small but powerful – On June 28, 2022, Rocket Lab launched a CubeSat to the Moon - a pathfinding mission to support NASA’s Artemis program which will land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon.

**Electron’s existential crisis, or not?** – While Electron has limitations in terms of carry capacity of 300 kg to LEO and the threat of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 Transporter Rideshare missions, Electron’s reliability and responsiveness together with its tailor-made missions have continued providing strength in demand evident from the signing of multi-launch agreements with its customers (Synspective, Capella Space, Blacksky etc.) Many discuss the threat of Electron being replaced by larger rockets, such as SpaceX’s Transporter rideshares or even Neutron cannibalising Electron in the future. However, just like taking an Uber directly to your destination or the bus somewhere near but not quite your destination, Electron together with its kick stage provides unrivaled accuracy, hitting target orbits with pinpoint accuracy.

**Why Capella Space chose Electron over Rideshare** 

“Instead of burning propellant to raise altitude, it’s far easier to simply be dropped off at a higher orbit by the launch vehicle. Being able to go higher than available rideshare missions was a major factor in Capella’s decision to pull Capella-9 from its planned launch and procure a dedicated ride from Rocket Lab for Capella-9 and Capella-10, which were launched in March 2023 on an Electron rocket to a targeted 600 km. This was also a major motivation behind the follow-on contract for four dedicated launches on Electron rockets for Acadia-generation satellites, the first of which launched to a targeted 640 km in August 2023”

[Continued Strong Demand for Electron](https://preview.redd.it/9hfpllwg6p3e1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=89128d9ce6e6660cdcb992ff6f3fdf0609146069)

The demand for Electron is also seen to be strong with the Average Selling Price increasing to what was $7.5 million to now $8.4 million. Furthermore, many of Electron’s direct competitors, mostly small launch ‘aspirational’ space companies have now been eliminated from the market. 

[ Astra Space Rocket 3 \(Dead\), Virgin Orbit LauncherOne \(Dead\), ABL Space RS1\(Dead\), Relativity Terran 1 \(Dead\), Firefly Alpha \(Dead Soon?\) ](https://preview.redd.it/57p1sfxr6p3e1.png?width=1795&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7b46dc23f26f9abd7236e9fd03fdbffc8789f8f)

It is NOT Rocket Science. Can’t really say that in this industry. Entrants to the small launch space have not fared well, many attribute it to a lack of demand as some pivot to larger launchers but in truth it seems that Electron has cemented its place as THE small launch provider.

**2. Haste**

https://preview.redd.it/v3l86x177p3e1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=30266164d98e447732f8e430c99bb58d3a4b887c

HASTE is a suborbital testbed launch vehicle derived from Rocket Lab’s heritage Electron rocket. HASTE provides reliable, high-cadence flight test opportunities needed to advance hypersonic and suborbital system technology development. Hypersonic speed is at least five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5 and above

From air-breathing and glide payloads to ballistic and future technologies, HASTE is a cost-effective and responsive hypersonic testbed that enables precision payload delivery for every mission.

[Leidos was awarded $334M air-breathing hypersonic system contract](https://preview.redd.it/rzpb8vfp8p3e1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=4995acc3b4ce982c65204c7969cc708a73981ec1)

Rocket Lab has had two HASTE missions so far, with the first HASTE mission on 17 June 2023 for Leidos. Leidos was awarded [$334M air-breathing hypersonic contract](https://www.leidos.com/insights/leidos-awarded-334m-air-breathing-hypersonic-system-contract) in 2022.

Russia has already demonstrated its use of the Khinzal hypersonic missile in Ukraine and the Pentagon’s warning to the congress that China already possesses the world’s leading hypersonic arsenal, the United States still does not possess its own arsenal of hypersonic missiles. As the US plays catch up, Rocket Lab stands to win, with at least another 3 HASTE missions for Leidos for 2024/2025  as part of the MACH-TB (Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed program.

Instead of highlighting how large the Total Addressable Market hypersonics could be, it would be more useful to highlight the innovation of Rocket Lab and also management’s ability to understand its technologies to adapt and create new use cases.

**3. Space Systems**

[We Don't Just Build Rockets in this Lab](https://preview.redd.it/03v1c2fk9p3e1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=27f2b92571ecd7eb36c692bb14caf370aa86db7b)

While rockets are really nice to look at, it is important to understand that launch business makes up only 20-30% of revenue of Rocket Lab, with Space Systems making up the majority of revenue contribution. Rocket Lab’s expansion into Space Systems through in-house capabilities or through acquisition is what seems to be most under-rated by investors/analysts.

**THIS IS WHERE I AM REALLY BULLISH. RECURRING REVENUE. MORE STUFF IN SPACE = MORE RECURRING REVENUE**

Starlink satellites have a lifespan of about five years. After which it will re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere and be destroyed. Satellites need replenishing, and companies are heading towards mega constellations to provide their services, Rocket Lab will either manufacture, provide components, flight software or even deploy them with Neutron. With the space economy projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030, and $1.8 trillion by 2035. Rocket Lab’s position as an end-to-end space company seems like a no-brainer as long as the company is able to capture a portion and with more than 1,700 satellites launched to orbit with Rocket Lab technology already, it seems to be on the right path. Some highlights of Rocket Lab’s space systems.

**a. Reaction Wheels**

[Love that we now ship pallets of reaction wheels to constellation customers. - Peter Beck](https://preview.redd.it/fofd4136bp3e1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=26d87d2a06b834269b21f22762292abb2dd2e37a)

A satellite typically needs at least three reaction wheels to control its movement along the X, Y, and Z axes. However, satellites often have four reaction wheels for redundancy

Deal already signed with a [single confidential mega constellation customer ](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/24/rocket-lab-reveals-big-supplier-deal-with-mystery-mega-constellation-customer/#:~:text=In%20its%20data%20sheet%20on,the%20base%20price%20at%20%24100%2C000)for thousands of reaction wheels per year. If you’re wondering who it could be… [Amazzz](https://www.youtube.com/live/wmmNuU8-Tr8?si=xpO2MeoKJ2KyHw5F&t=1218)

Amazon’s Kuiper constellation will have an initial 3,236 satellites Which likely will need replenishing every five years as well. That’s a good stream of recurring revenue for reaction wheels alone.

[\~4,000 to 5,000 satellites launched annually in 2030 - McKinsey](https://preview.redd.it/lmb1i4tmcp3e1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e5378628bdb2ce794333f878b8f54c530979638)

McKinsey anticipates in the base case, 27,000 active satellites in orbit by the end of 2030, almost a four-fold increase from today. To maintain that number at the assumed lifespan, there would need to be 4,000 to 5,000 satellites launched per year. In the high-demand scenario, in which nearly all proposed constellations materialize, McKinsey would expect to see more than 65,000 satellites, including many heavier ones, on orbit by 2030.

**b. Space Grade Solar**

[In 2022, Rocket Lab acquired leading satellite solar power producer SolAero Technologies. ](https://preview.redd.it/boenu4xrdp3e1.png?width=921&format=png&auto=webp&s=35bc3927f9baa504c4f498ec3ffddf844c274cd2)

Satellites need power. With the acquisition of Sol Aero, Rocket Lab is now one of the few space grade solar providers. Already there are more than 1,100 satellites in space powered by Rocket Lab solar products. The company has also been [awarded $23.9million](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-11-25/us-finalizes-awards-to-bae-systems-rocket-lab-for-semiconductor-chips) to boost the company’s production of solar cells by 50% over the next three years.

**c. Separation Systems**

[No separation anxiety - Example of Rocket Lab’s Separation System](https://preview.redd.it/i8s75ussep3e1.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a75dda0512efd875bab92e6f01da9ca86fee5d96)

In 2021 Rocket Lab acquired Planetary Systems Corporation which has designed, built, and delivered separation systems for more than 20 years with a 100% success rate - no product has ever failed to operate in flight. With the scale and resources of Rocket Lab behind the team, we are now making separation systems available globally at scale.

**d. Space Software**

[In October 2021, Rocket Lab acquired Advanced Solutions, Inc \(ASI\), a Colorado-based aerospace engineering firm delivering mission proven space software, mission simulation, and testing solutions.](https://preview.redd.it/quczg7jyep3e1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=98c4593cdd1a44f7e5e3377c5ea0b8be3c21a571)

As part of the end-to-end service, Rocket Lab also provides software and operation for customer satellites.

The vertically integrated and end-to-end space service Rocket Lab provides will allow customers who are looking to provide a service from space do so without any knowledge of building and operating spacecrafts.

Right now companies like Varda are still space companies applying pharmaceutical and life science applications, and even have outsourced [Rocket Lab will to conduct in-space operations](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-completes-second-spacecraft-for-varda-space-industries-advancing-in-space-manufacturing/), reentry positioning maneuvers, and deorbiting to recover Varda’s capsule while they attempt to develop the own in-house solutions. However, Rocket Lab's end goal as THE end-to-end space provider, is for companies with no knowledge of building or operating spacecrafts contracting Rocket Lab for its services.

**4. Catalysts**  
Written so much and I have not even covered Neutron, Space Race, Possibility with Mars Sample Return, NSSL Neutron On-ramping, SDA Contracts, Human rated Neutron launches. I'll point over to [Dave G Investing's video](https://youtu.be/rt4_g87TxL8?si=PHAi9oegs_13u0AL) on the potential nearer term catalysts, I think he covers it in great detail.

[Dave G Investing - Potential Catalysts](https://preview.redd.it/xvnfaef9jp3e1.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=540f11194cebd49866ceb72b3b7a7e6e628b4a0c)

Further term growth opportunities include Neutron signing more commercial launches to deploy constellations or even taking on some contracts to help deploy Kuiper if any of their launch providers for their 83 launches fail to deliver. Also as SPB mentioned, Neutron’s success will then allow for Rocket Lab to develop its own constellation. These catalysts really show the uncapped potential of the company, which makes valuing the company today extremely difficult, which is why I will be holding my shares, at least a good amount of it till 2030.

**5. Conclusion**

[This guy doesn't build shit](https://preview.redd.it/wqzjk4zmjp3e1.png?width=1505&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5b3ab591beb4426ff8223a327fa6c41f8e14b44)

Trust in SPB. He knows Rockets. Watch Wild Wild Space on HBO for those who haven't.

Rocket engineer at heart, he developed Electron with less than $100 million compared to rockets like Virgin Orbit's LauncherOne estimated to be over $1 billion and still failed.

Let's talk MSR and competing proposals...,"MSR. So hot right now. For better or worse, I wanted to share my opinions on the likelihood RKLB gets the MSR mission.

I realize we only have the abstracts for the proposals, but it should be enough to tell us who is taking this seriously. I'm honestly flabbergasted at some of the proposals, and I've attempted to summarize the abstracts even further below. You'll quickly see that it's a two, MAYBE three horse race... and RKLB is in it.

* Rocket Lab: ""We put a lot of effort into this proposal, and intend to show you just why we are the perfect choice. We can and have done nearly everything you're asking a company to do, we have a proven track record and a reliable path to mission success, and we can do it faster and cheaper than anyone else.""

* Lockheed Martin: ""Sure, we can do it for your max budget and.... sometime... before 2040. We have lots of experience with this stuff, dude. We've partnered with you before and we sure liked all the cash you filled our coffers with. Give us the contract and we will do the bare minimum to meet any of your needs. But we're pals, man! Like, our relationship goes WAY back... and don't forget the lobbying money we spend! So... can we have the money now? kthx""

* Blue Origin: ""So you're already building SLS and HLS, so...let's like... leverage those options, and then you won't even need to worry about how many samples you can return! *SLAPS 4 BILLION DOLLAR ROCKET* This baby can fit SO MANY mars samples inside of it!! We can't talk about schedule because uh.... that's kind of on you (wink wink) but uh.... we think by using these options you might be able to accelerate your schedule? But listen to THIS... we've got a couple of super brainy Ph.D.'s leading a ""team"" of EXPERTS looking into all of this, and they have a whole 50 years of combined experience on mars missions! So uh.... pick us, and then we might actually take any of this seriously.""

* Quantum Space: ""We develop spacecraft. Or.... I guess... we're trying to. We haven't had any success at all, but we're smart cookies who think outside the box!! We think we came up with a novel but quite difficult approach to trajectory and spacecraft needs by basically doing a lunar orbit rendezvous and hand off of the samples to another vessel before returning to Earth. Sure, we know you're probably going to call this bullshit, be we prefer to call it a ""disruptive concept"""".

* Aerojet Rocketdyne: ""We're smart cookies and we take this seriously. We've already identified areas where we can reduce the mass of the theoretical MAV and SRL, and that would allow us to use existing technologies to get the lander on the surface. We've been doing this a long time and have a lot of success, and we've already started to figure out which propulsion technologies would fit into a mission like this or which would need to develop further. We really want to use the skycrane to land the MAV, and will likely concentrate all efforts on that front since it would speed things up considerably. The reduced mass MAV and SRL will allow us to return plenty of samples.""

* Northrop Grumman: ""So we are like, quite competent in propulsion, and we've been doing this stuff for like, a really long time. We will do some uh.... engineering.... and uh, we want some government money so we can keep developing our solid rocket motors. And then you can use them for this mission!! :D""

* SpaceX: ""Uhh... we're already going to mars. We don't know when, but.... we can just pick up your samples for you while we're there, and then charge you a shit ton of money for the privilege :) Sit back and relax!""

* Whittinghill Aerospace: ""We're a cutting-edge tech firm out of the Midwest, awaiting imminent patent approval on the next generation of ~~radar detectors (D2D)~~ MON hybrid rocket motors that have both huge military and civilian applications. Now, right now John, our stock trades over the counter at $0.10.... but we..... oh shit.... wrong number.""


So, alright then. We have some serious proposals, and we have some jokers. I think there are a few that you can remove straight off the bat. Whittinghill and Quantum Space. One is an engineering company, and the other makes spacecraft. Lots of companys do both, these companies do just the one, and are both quite small and not in a position to handle such an important contract. That widles us down from 8 to 6.

This is where it gets a little tricky, since we don't know what's actually in the proposals... all we have are the abstracts. But taking things at face value, there are a few additional proposals that don't really seem to be taking it seriously, or don't really offer any value to NASA by choosing them. Those options are Lockheed, BO, and Northrop. Yes, THOSE BIG THREE. Why? Lockheed is basically ""max budget, max timeline"". What incentive does that provide? BO relies on SLS sticking around AND on HLS sticking around.... which kinda feels like a complication of.... the SpaceX option? And Northrop can just pound sand. Their abstract is one of the worst in the whole bunch outside of Whittinghil and Quantum IMO. 

So... that leaves THREE actual ""competitors"" IMO. Let's dig into those. Rocket Lab, SpaceX, and Aerojet Rocketdyne, so let's start with Rocketdyne. They've put in the effort here, and have the company heritage to execute on their claims. They want to leverage existing technologies, while developing their rocket motors further so they can reduce the weight of the MAV. Smart cookies here, but no real promise on a timeline. Just vague talks of being able to 'accelerate' the timeline if they CAN leverage the skycrane the way they want. Solid choice, reasonable value to NASA. I give this option a B+.

Now let's talk about SpaceX. It's not so much a 'proposal' for a 'mission' as it is like, ""Hey Jim, I'm running to the store anyways. Want me to bring you back anything? Oh...no... I'm not going now. I'm going in like... 5-9 years... or something?"". It's not a BAD proposal, but without knowing the financials it's hard to say how likely NASA would be to choose this option. They're relying on HLS anyways, so if Starship is gonna be a thing, this could make sense. But they lose a lot of control, and who knows if their proposal is for a $9B budget and a return date in 2038? They don't say, and I don't think NASA will like losing that much control and influence on the mission. I give this option a C-. Feasible, but probably not NASA's best actual choice, since it really strips them of their autonomy.

And finally.... Rocket Lab. They can do it for under $2B on a fixed-price contract WAY earlier than NASA's requirement of 2040. They've built spacecraft, sent spacecraft to the moon using multiple trajectory burns, they've engineered and built spacecraft busses, reaction wheels, solar panels, navigation and guidance systems, rocket engines and rockets themselves, and they've even returned a capsule to earth that had samples inside of it already. They can do the entire mission, end-to-end, for 18.1% of NASA's budget, and get the samples here almost a DECADE earlier than required. Even IF NASA choose RKLB and they didn't deliver as promised, NASA would have SO much damn cash left to pursue other avenues (and presumably, almost a decade to do it...) that it would seem almost criminal for them not to select the RKLB proposal. RKLB could fail and they'd still be likely to succeed ""Hey Elon... grab us some samples on your next 2038 Mars mission... here's $5B"". Cool. NASA still got the samples back before 2040 and for $7B. I give this proposal an A-. The only thing keeping me from an A or an A+ is that Neutron isn't flying yet.

So, those are my big three that have a chance, but I personally think it boils down to Rocket Lab and Aerojet Rocketdyne. SpaceX is going to mars anyways, and like I mentioned above, we could just pivot to having them bring us back some samples a decade from now if things don't otherwise work out. For that reason, I give the SpaceX proposal a 15% chance of being selected, the Rocketdyne proposal a 40% chance of being selected, and RKLB a 45% chance of being selected. I'm assuming all the proposals I 'eliminated' earlier have a 0% chance, but that's likely not true. However, I wanted to simplify this.

So, from my seat, RKLB is actually the MOST likely proposal to be selected for MSR? Why? Execution, cost, and timeline PLUS the ability to NASA to pivot to SpaceX in the 2030's if necessary. Rocketdyne a close second.

I'd love to hear what you guys think of my analysis. Happy turkey day!",70,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1h248x8/lets_talk_msr_and_competing_proposals/
Diversifying in space stocks beyond RKLB,"Out of the main space stocks im aware of (RKLB, LUNR, ASTS, RDW), RKLB is my favorite but I have done some research on it and watched a lot of YouTube videos and it is currently about 50% of my portfolio. 

Wondering what you guys think about diversifying into other space stocks like the others I mentioned, to not have too much money invested in one company. 

If you do invest in other space stocks, what are they and why do you hold them instead of just adding to RKLB?

For my very little research in the other 3 companies, LUNR stands out to me as possibly being the one I would consider adding next, but if I did it would be a much smaller amount compared to RKLB. Maybe 1/20th-1/10th of the ammount I have in RKLB.

An Observation ,"I’m sure we’re all excited about another monster trading session after a surreal run up.  I’m probably not the only one wondering each week if, and when, the eventual pull back is going to happen..  only to see the stock go higher.

I thought I’d share a quick story of an interaction earlier today to give some context to what many of us wrestle with.

I went to PT this morning, and we were shooting the breeze about life when she asked what I was up to.  We’re pretty good friends at this point, and the conversation drifted towards investing since it’s something I’m passionate about.  Naturally, Rocket Lab came up, and she was genuinely curious so I spent some time sharing the bullet points about the company, Peter Beck, the sector, etc.  The other two providers that were nearby joined in the conversation since they didn’t have clients at the time, and so I talked to them about it too.

What was absolutely fascinating to me was that none of them had ever heard of Rocket Lab.  These are intelligent, accomplished, capable medical professionals.  

People like to joke about you know it’s time to sell when you over hear Uber & Lyft drivers talking about a stock.  I think the opposite is true as well.  Anecdotally, outside of this sub, WSB, and X/twitter, there is practically no one in my professional or personal spheres that has heard of this company - unless I’ve personally told them about it.  

My point is..  the recent run up as been incredible, and while there is a very real possibility of a drawback in the near future, especially for some unforeseen news or black swan event, this company is still one of the best kept secrets.  

Of course I could be wrong, and there is a lot of risk ahead and plenty that could go badly..  However, I think this is still just the initial wave crashing upon the shoreline.  Once more people clue in, it’s going to be interesting.

I’d be very curious how many folks on this sub have had anyone tell them about RKLB, and not the other way around.

TLDR:  we are just getting started.

Powerful endorsement yesterday by Blackrock for both ASTS and RKLB,"i am pretty sure no one posted this on this sub, so here goes:

Tony Kim, Head of Technology Investing at BlackRock, discusses AST SpaceMobile and Rocket Lab at the Deutsche Bank Global Space Summit 2024.

“In the public market, I think there are two companies that are over $5B and they have been a recent resurgence, but it has been 20 years of hell. But there has been a recent resurgence of two companies that crossed $5B of market cap …. And the two are not posterchilds of profitability. What they are is that they represent leadership. The power log ?
In the case of one company regarding potentially unlocking direct communications and the other one , the alternative to SpaceX on launch. So those are the two. They’re not really profitable yet, but they have the market valuation. The rest, they are mired in small subset of valuations? So yes, profitability is of course important, but I think more important is, are you a viable business with scale. Are you one of the companies that will achieve scale. And with scale comes profitability.”

Should You Buy $RKLB After the Big Run-Up? Here’s a Litmus Test,"Hey everyone,

I’ve noticed a lot of posts lately asking, “Should I buy $RKLB now after the huge price increase?” Here’s a litmus test to help guide your decision:

First, ask yourself: If you already owned the stock, would you sell it now? If the answer is no because you think the price will continue to rise, then why wouldn’t you buy more now? If you believe in the company’s long-term future, the recent run-up shouldn’t deter you.

Remember, investors are in it for the long haul. Traders are the ones making short-term moves. And if you’re asking a biased community for financial advice, it’s probably a sign that you’re not the best trader. Timing the market is notoriously difficult, and most people don’t get it right.

So instead of focusing on short-term fluctuations, ask yourself if Rocket Lab’s long-term vision aligns with your investment goals. Don’t try to time the market—make decisions based on your confidence in the company’s future.

As always, do your own research and assess your personal financial situation.

Neutron and a constellation isn't the end of the story,"While discussing planning a trip to VA to watch the first Neutron launch with my 12 year old son (who is very interested in space and investing), he asked an interesting question. He asked me ""What comes after Neutron and Rocket Labs constellation? What's next? Do they just stop there and run Neutron like a satellite school bus from then on?""

I don't know the answer, but the first thought that came to mind was ""Peter Beck will figure that out when the time comes.""

Neutron and a mega constellation, along with a thriving space systems business, is a ways away. That's the carrot at the end of the stick. Even so, that can't be the end of the story. I find it difficult to believe that is as far as it goes.

Do you think that is as far as the story goes, or are there chapters unwritten beyond? ",91,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1gt6t97/neutron_and_a_constellation_isnt_the_end_of_the/
Space operations and management constellation?,"With the imminent retirement of the NASA ""Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System"" (TDRS), I have been wondering if some sort of space operations and management constellation might be a good candidate for Rocket Lab's first space services constellation?

First some background courtesy of Chat GPT:

**What is the TDRS?**

The *Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System* (TDRS) is NASA's communication network used to support real-time data and command transmission between Earth and spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO), such as the International Space Station and the Hubble Space Telescope. Operating since 1983, TDRS consists of multiple geostationary satellites and ground stations, providing near-continuous coverage.

The system facilitates telemetry, tracking, and data transfer, enabling critical operations for various NASA missions. NASA is transitioning to commercial services as TDRS ages.

**What is the CSP?**

The *Communication Services Project* (CSP) is a NASA initiative aimed at transitioning from government-owned satellite communication systems, such as the TDRS, to commercially operated services. The CSP involves partnerships with private companies to develop and demonstrate advanced communication capabilities for space missions. These capabilities include satellite relay, ground-to-space communications, and data transmission, ensuring reliable and cost-effective support for NASA's future needs. The project is a cornerstone of NASA's strategy to leverage private-sector innovation for space infrastructure.

**What is SSA?**

*Space Situational Awareness* (SSA) refers to the ability to track and understand the behavior of objects in space, including active satellites, debris, and other spacecraft. SSA involves monitoring their positions, predicting potential collisions, and assessing risks to space operations. It is crucial for satellite operators, governments, and military organizations to ensure safe and sustainable use of Earth's orbits, particularly as space becomes increasingly crowded with new satellites and debris. SSA data is gathered using ground-based and space-based sensors, radar, and optical systems.

**What is a SON?**

*Satellite Operations Network* (SON) refers to the integrated system of ground stations, communication links, and software infrastructure used to manage, monitor, and control a satellite or a constellation of satellites. The SON ensures the execution of mission commands, monitors telemetry data, and facilitates two-way communication between satellites and operators. Advanced SONs often include automation, real-time data analysis, and tools for handling large-scale constellations with minimal human intervention.

**What is STM?**

*Space Traffic Management* (STM) refers to the planning, coordination, and execution of operations to ensure the safe and sustainable use of Earth’s orbital environment. It encompasses tracking space objects (satellites, debris), avoiding collisions, managing orbital slots, and coordinating launches. STM combines policy frameworks, technical systems (like SSA), and international cooperation to mitigate risks from space congestion and orbital debris, ensuring efficient and safe space operations for both public and private entities.

**What would you call a combined SSA, SON and STM system?**

A combined system integrating *Space Situational Awareness* (SSA), *Satellite Operations Network* (SON), and *Space Traffic Management* (STM) could be called an *Integrated Space Operations and Management System* (ISOMS) or *Unified Orbital Management Network* (UOMN).

Such a system would unify tracking, operational control, and traffic management functions, ensuring seamless coordination between monitoring orbital environments, controlling satellite constellations, and preventing collisions or other orbital conflicts. This integration would enable efficient and secure satellite operations in increasingly congested space environments.

Thanks Chat GPT!

I'm not suggesting that Rocket Lab will join other commercial entities participating in the CSP, there are already plenty of big names there including Kuiper and Starlink. Perhaps Rocket Lab may partner with some of them. But it occurs to me that if you want to build an end-to-end space company, that designs, builds and operates customer constellations, you'll need some of the same functionality that the TDRS provides NASA - and you may not want to rely on other commercial CSP entities to provide it.

Back over to Chat GPT:

**Describe a UOMN constellation? How many satellites? How many ground stations? What orbits required?**

A *Unified Orbital Management Network* (UOMN) constellation would likely require a combination of LEO (Low Earth Orbit) and MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) satellites to cover both tracking and communication needs. The number of satellites would depend on coverage requirements, but a network of 30–50 satellites could be sufficient for global tracking and communication.

Ground stations would be strategically placed worldwide, with at least 5–10 ground stations for redundancy and global reach. The system would also need robust inter-satellite links, especially for real-time traffic management and command/control capabilities.

Thanks Chat GPT!

OK so Rocket Lab would need some help with ground stations, and whilst they have their own RF space radios, they may also want to pick up some space optical expertise. With $300M in the Mergers & Aquisitions kitty, perhaps there are some targets?

Rocket Lab Q3 Earnings Highlights!,,21,2,https://youtu.be/_SmjFc6wzbQ?si=Mzy7BCrrpUZ1g4rd
Valuation ,"I keep seeing comments that RKLB is cheap and SpaceX is overvalued. Or other commentary that sounds like it is based on faith and not thought out metrics. Full disclosure I'm bullish on both. 

Morgan Stanley has probably one of the most publicly available in-depth analysis of SpaceX value. They note that 60% of the value is in Starlink. That would make SpaceX rocket side about a $75B valuation. Given their launch revenue was estimated to be $5.5B for 2024 that is a revenue multiplier of 13.6x. Apply that to Rocket lab and you get a valuation of $10b on $245m of revenue and you have a revenue multiplier of 40.8x. 

RocketLab's launch business is three times more expensive to buy than SpaceX's right now. Not sure SpaceX is overvalued (on launch).  Starship is arguably a much bigger leap than Neutron (new model vs providing a launch alternative to existing model). So, not sure how SpaceX can be called overvalued and at the same time saying RocketLab has room for another 150% gain ($50 share).

If this is correct (and it was quick and sort price analysis), does RKLB benefit from IPO access and demand for the sector that cannot be easily accessed via SpaceX? Is there something else driving the multiplier difference? Yes both companies do more than launch, but one has turned that into revenue while the other is just starting down that path. And that portion of the valuation is pulled out of SpaceX in the above analysis and assumed to be $0 for RKLB. 

Maybe that's the difference. That the market is already valuing the non-launch business at even more astronomical multipliers than SpaceX's non-launch business.",60,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1gs6fmx/valuation/
SpaceX Encourages Competition,"SpaceX’s President and COO encouraged competition in space, emphasizing that the market is enormous and that it’s unlikely SpaceX alone can service the entire market. Especially in space broadband, she described the opportunity as huge with room for plenty of competition. Basically, the tide is ready to lift all boats and they don’t see their construction of a luxury super yacht as holding anyone else back from getting rich in the new space economy…

On launch, it also appears they are willing to make trade offs in medium launch to capture the most profitable end of heavy launch in pursuit of their long term goals. That seems to leave the door wide open for Rocket Lab. Interesting comments:

“Starship is really a replacement. It obsoletes Falcon 9 and the Dragon capsule. Now, we’re not shutting down Falcon, we are not shutting down Dragon — we’ll be flying that for six to eight more years,” she said.

“But ultimately, people are going to want to fly on Starship: It’s bigger, it’s more comfortable, it will be less expensive,” Shotwell added.”",70,23,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/15/spacex-gwynne-shotwell-starlink-competition.html

Confidential Customers?  Expect more of them and why I’m accumulating shares.,"First of all I screwed up buy reducing my shares after it gained 200%.  I was buying at $3.5 - $6 and after a healthy increase I sold some around $10.  I still have a good amount and I’m accumulating again and here is why…

This latest launch was by a “confidential customer” and the new contracts for neutron are also from a “confidential customer.”  I knew they would beat earnings since the new customer wasn’t factored into the earnings forecast during the Q3 presentation so I bought a bunch more and calls just before earnings.  Be prepared to see “confidential customer” a lot from Rocket Lab in the future.  A lot of developed countries, especially in Europe, do not see Trump as an ally and now that Leon is part of the government they want to distance themselves from him and SpaceX.  If Trump installs large tariffs then you can easily predict a trade war.  The faster these other countries get up their own internet satellite systems the better.  Not only do they not want to rely on Starlink for secure communications, they don’t want to rely on SpaceX to put up their satellites.  This is where Rocket Lab will be taking full advantage of having non-U.S. based launch facilities.  For those that have been here awhile there were rumors of Rocket Lab acquiring a constellation builder in the U.K.  I fully expect that to happen now to service their European and Asian customers and be fully integrated from build to launch.   I bet we get news of that before the 4th Quarter earnings in February.  Several people that are very Pro SpaceX / Leon  won’t read this far and you will see responses from them below calling this bullshit and how SpaceX is far and away the only real private company option for other countries….just watch.

My prediction is RKLB between $35 - $50 by the end of 2025 unless there is a black swan event.

The rate to borrow on [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rklb) for tomorrow is 3.3% APR. Now that's not really HIGH but it is much higher than it was the past week because the fee goes up when more people want to short it (read about it [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-loan-fee.asp)).  So more shorts interested in us.  The more shares short, the more downward pressure on the stock. 

I still see blanket 10M shares available short but I don't know where that info came from or if it's the 2 week lag that is often placed on the public info (and I don't have a subscription to the services that update it).  IBKR shows shares still available but that likely won't update until 7am EST tomorrow as well. 

There's too many brokers out there but if you are long the stock and you don't want your shares leant out (to be paid a portion of that 3.3% because brokers take their cut of course), you should google: ""\[insert your broker\] opt out of securities lending"". 

All the brokers think this is a good thing - [RH](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/stock-lending/), [Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/securities-lending), [Ally](https://www.ally.com/invest/self-directed-trading/securities-income-program/), [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/fully-paid-lending), etc. - Likely your broker has it too. They all ""want you to earn interest"" but to read up a bit more on [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitieslending.asp).. but they summarize to this:

[Aug 2023] Buying Rocket Lab is like sending money up in smoke : Jim Cramer,,37,38,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt1VXmn_6Eo
Positive press for Firefly and its posture for competition against Neutron and others…,"What are your thoughts on the the heavy recent investment in Firefly? They appear to be targeting similar market segments to both Rocket Lab and Intuitive Machines - anyone here concerned about the potential for their medium launch vehicle to outcompete Neutron or otherwise siphon market share? 

From the article:
“In the hierarchy of launch vehicles, these one-ton-class rockets fit in between a class of heavier rockets, such as those from SpaceX, United Launch Alliance, and Blue Origin, and smaller launchers like Rocket Lab's Electron. Rocket Lab is the clear leader in the lighter launch segment, while Firefly is well ahead of its cohort in the one-ton launcher race. Like Firefly, Rocket Lab is also working on its own medium-class rocket called the Neutron…”

“NASA has awarded Firefly three task orders under the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. Firefly will soon ship its first Blue Ghost lunar lander to Florida for final preparations to launch to the Moon and deliver 10 NASA-sponsored scientific instruments and tech demo experiments to the lunar surface. NASA has a contract with Firefly for a second Blue Ghost mission, plus an agreement for Firefly to transport a European data relay satellite to lunar orbit.

Firefly also boasts a healthy backlog of missions on its Alpha rocket. In June, Lockheed Martin announced a deal for as many as 25 Alpha launches through 2029. Two months later, L3Harris inked a contract with Firefly for up to 20 Alpha launches. Firefly has also signed Alpha launch contracts with NASA, NOAA, the Space Force, and the National Reconnaissance Office. One of these Alpha launches will deploy Firefly's first orbital transfer vehicle, named Elytra, designed to host customer payloads and transport them to different orbits following separation from the launcher's upper stage.

And there's the Medium Launch Vehicle, a rocket Firefly and Northrop Grumman hope to launch as soon as 2026…”",6,20,https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/firefly-aerospace-rakes-in-more-cash-as-competitors-struggle-for-footing/

RKLB Backlog,"RKLB ended Q3 of 2024 with $1.05 Billion in backlog, this is a decrease of $17,000,000 from their backlog at the end of Q2 which stood at $1.067 Billion.

Value of the Mahia spaceport?,"One thing that is occasionally brought up in the financial analyses is RKLB’s ownership of the Māhia launch complex.  

It’s obviously a boon to the company to own and operate its own spaceport but I’m wondering if it should get more play in discussing Rocket Lab’s uniqueness as an investment.  It seems to me that as time goes on, it’s going to become even more difficult to procure sites for launch - certainly in the US it’s not easy, and you have to fight a mountain of regulations (which may or may not go away under Trump).  Owning a launch site in a developed country with low levels of international air traffic seems to be a major strategic win and another big point in favor of rocket lab’s moat. 

Is there a legal/regulatory reason that Mahia is limited to electron launches?  Is this ITAR stuff (build neutron in the US, can’t ship that tech out of the US?).

Does anyone understand or can point to a source that explains the exact relation between Apple, Globalstar, MDA and RKLB ?

The way I understand it is Apple contracts Globalstar to operate a constellation to provide direct to cell services which then contracts MDA to build the spacecraft, MDA then subcontracts RKLB for most of the design / satellite bus

Sounds like the reaction wheels contract could maybe be for a Apple constellation rather than Kuiper

How do you see it and then what percentage of the 1.5 Billion can we execpt to subcontract its way to RKLB and maybe be announced at earnings next week ?

Advice to small investors on RKLB - Stay away from buying options for a while.,"This is an advice to small investors who are entering the market from an experienced investor who did lose money playing options.

Options are very tempting at the moment given the run RKLB had this quarter. Every stock will have pullback. When it does, time value eat away potential profits.

Your best bet through earnings is to buy the stock and sell out of the money covered calls for November end. The money you make from the covered calls, you can put it back into RKLB to increase your share count. Don't despair if your options are called. Do it again.

Consider buying options when RSI goes below 40 and MACDs are in negative territory. This is where technical analysis will help you.

If the options you bought are expiring worthless, you giving free money to whales. A $1000 from you pocket may not seem much. But a hundred players like yourself giving free money to whales every week is Big Whale Money.

Here's my take on Apple's $1.5 billion investment and the impact it could have on RKLB,"***\\!/ This is not financial advice \\!/***

For those who aren't aware already, Apple has just announced on Friday a $1.5 billion satellite investment with Globalstar to improve space-based communications for iPhones. The deal is expected to close on Nov. 5.

Here is all the information I could find in order to form a realistic expectation on the effects such a deal could have on RKLB.

First things first, Globalstar is the company with which Apple has been partnering with since 2022 to offer emergency services on its latest iPhones when terrestrial networks are unavailable. Globalstar is managing the constellation Apple uses to provide that service. It is specified in the deal that Apple will make cash payments of $1.1 billion to help Globalstar fund the new network of satellites but, it is also said that SpaceX is expected to begin launching those new satellites next year. It is important to note that Globalstar's constellation is in LEO (low-earth orbit) and that  their network does not \*yet\* provide more bandwidth-hungry services such as voice and broadband as of today.

**Back to 2022's subcontract with MDA:**

RocketLab is directly involved in Globalstar's ""old"" constellation because in 2022, RKLB was awarded a subcontract by MDA ""to lead the design and manufacture of 17 spacecraft buses for Globalstar’s new Low Earth Orbit satellites"". MDA is the company that initially got the contrat to build those 17 new satellites. Rocket Lab is also developing the Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC) for the constellation. The Globalstar SOCC includes a continuous satellite control and monitoring using Rocket Lab’s MAX GDS, a constellation-class ground software solution that provides complete spacecraft command and control. What is also important to note is that the telemetry and control radio for all spacecraft will also be a C-band variant of Rocket Lab’s Frontier Satellite Radio (Frontier-C). Rocket Lab's Frontier Satellite Radios are Software-defined radio (SDR). SDRs are a radio communication system where components that conventionally have been implemented in analog hardware (e.g. mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, etc.) are instead implemented by means of software on a computer or embedded system. 

**What are spacecraft buses?:**

Spacecraft buses can be referred to as satellite platforms which are the support on which to mount instruments and the infrastructure for the mission such as power, communications to the ground and navigation. A spacecraft bus consists of everything needed to transport, protect, and operate the payload. In our case, RKLB was in charge of the manufacturing of the satellite platforms in the 2022 contract and MDA was in charge of the payload which is the primary function of the satellite's mission. 

**MDA's new Aurora satellites:**

MDA announced their new Aurora satellite line in March 2024. Aurora is a new software-defined satellite product line which is basically a transition from analog to digital satellite technology. MDA has also made new partnerships with new companies to supply components for Aurora. 

Here's a list of a few partnerships I could find: 

1. Aerospacelab announced July 8, 2024 that it will provide more than 200 battery charge regulators for MDA Space’s Aurora satellites over a three-year period starting in 2026. These components are used to manage power distribution and battery charging in satellite systems. 
2. Airbus will supply more than 200 Sparkwing solar arrays that will be built on a designated line at Airbus' high-capacity production facility in Leiden, the Netherlands.
3. Switzerland’s Huber+Suhner was selected to supply more than 60,000 multi-channel radio frequency (RF). 

The list above refers to components that are used in the manufacturing of a satellite platform/satellite bus. If MDA was still using RKLB's satellite platforms, why would they buy components which are generally used for the making of the satellite platform and not the payload? 

Also, SDR setup involves an RF front-end connected to a computer that will perform the conversions from analog to digital. In other words and from my understanding, multi-channel radio refrequency (RF) is a component used in the making of a Software-defined radio (SDR). If MDA was still using RKLB's SDRs, why would they buy multi-channel frequency systems from another supplier? 

Obviously, I'm not an aerospace engineer or anywhere near that job industry, but prior to the launch of their new Aurora line, I personally think MDA needed RKLB's SDR to actually make their precedent satellite line ""Software-defined"". Since they've now developed their own fully software-defined satellite line, it doesn't seem like they'd still use RKLB's components. Also, the latest contracts for Aurora satellites do not mention any partnership with RKLB. In fact, MDA's press release in August 2023 about their contract with Telesat briefly mentions a new line of satellite and a transition from analog to software-defined satellites. It also seems like, by the recent partnerships MDA made for Aurora's components, that MDA is now making their very own satellite buses also. 

**From all the information above, here's what I think:**

1. It doesn't seem like RKLB is going to be the launch provider since SpaceX is already slated to begin launches in 2025. 
2. In November 2023, MDA received an Authorization to Proceed (ATP) contract from an undisclosed customer to start work on a new Non-Geostationary Orbit (NGSO) satellite constellation (valued at $180 million). The definitive contract for the full constellation (valued at around $750 million) is expected in 2024. We can hope for the unnamed customer to be linked to Apple's new investment since the contract and the constellation' valuations both make sense, price wise, with the total investment made by Apple's and the $1.1 billion payments that will be made to Globalstar in order to help them fund the new constellation. The timeline between the ATP with MDA and Apple's announcement for their new investment also both make sense. However, if that contract actually turns out to be tied to Apple's new investment, I'm not really optimistic on the fact that Rocket Lab is still involved in the spacecraft bus manufacturing.
3. Because Apple's main objective with their new investment is to improve space-based communications for iPhones, I see this new investment as an extension to their first partnership with Globalstar back in 2022. That being said, I think it would make sense if Globalstar continues to use Rocket Lab's constellation-class ground software for their new satellite constellation because from my understanding, the new constellation's purpose is to act as a complement to the one currently operated. 
4. Globalstar didn't want to elaborate on the upgrades their new constellation would bring to space-based communications on iPhones. By looking at RKLB's old press releases about the 2022 contract, I've found this very precise sentence: ""These new satellites and SOCC will augment Globalstar’s existing constellation delivering reliable mobile satellite voice and data services from space."" However, Globalstar's current constellation does not \*yet\* provide more bandwidth-hungry services such as voice and broadband as of today. Is it possible that the new satellites partly built by RKLB would provide such an upgrade to GlobalStar's currently offered services? 

I'd like to know what you guys think and feel free to share your opinion!

MSR is likely the biggest near term upside catalyst to RKLB alongside Neutron it uses so this increasing competitive pressure for US to avoid a new ""Sputnik moment"" is relevant.

New Zealand And UK Agree Blueprint For Satellite Removal And Servicing Missions,"This news has gotten less attention. As some estimate LEO can handle of the order of 100,000 satellites before elevated risk to the Kessler effect, servicing, replacing and removal of satellites will become an ongoing big market.

Since there is a constellation gold rush to LEO with Starlink, Kuiper, OneWeb, IRIS, Chinese 30k cluster, Globalstar, PlanetLab, ASTS, ICEYE, SDA,  BlackSky, E-Space, Kineis, etc. it will be very busy up there.

And as the New Zealand orbital rocket company list is not very long, especially with dedicated small launch and Victus Haze mission type LEO precision rendezvous skills, this UK NZ deal is worth mentioning as an example of things (read: RKLB business) to come.

Not astrology! Promise!!!  Just sharing what I have been watching on the latest uptrend…,"Not an astrologer.

(Post is) Not really a conversation starter or anything too noteworthy, but sharing because it does display strength and accumulation. 

Nfa though. I’m sharing something that reinforces my thesis. Rocket Lab will be 100$ a share and it won’t be a pump and dump (long time from now, but it’s happening).

This is how I know.

Connecting the chart / daily price action, and the accumulation that has happened on this uptrend... 

When share price has dipped to the low end of a range (chart flattens out for a week or so), I have noticed large scale orders spike (not retail buys, massive buys). Noticed the same thing when the candles trade sideways on each step of the staircase on this last rise. The large orders hit the tape on the lower end of the price range. Then, share price takes the next step up.

Like I said, nothing noteworthy. What it displays though can give you, us dumb money retail investors, a little more confidence in holding your shares. You selling isn’t going to really do anything to the price, not trying to sell you on my thesis…. but maybe it will help you not bail on an opportunity to change your financial situation without doing anything… Don’t get scared out of your position. 

The spikes on the price cost distribution chart display consolidation / institutional buying in at the low end of the trading range / building positions. 

To connect the images simply…

First image displays the daily chart, each candle is 1 day. The sideways price action is accumulation and is directly correlated to the spikes on the “cost distribution chart in second image. Then the last image displays the order flow for today. Notice the large scale orders. That is not retail investors. That is institutional buying and they hold their shares for a very long time. This allows share price to keep going up. Gradually, and not without dips.

Blackrock owned 4.9% of the company (just under disclosure requirements / 13 g). They bought another 1.1% of the company (disclosed last week, think they have 15 -30 days to file the 13). Yes they own everything, but a ~6% position is not to be ignored.

More institutions will follow. Current institutional ownership is just over 57%. Has increased steadily since the decrease in inst ownership when Kholsa distributed shares / lock-up ended. That was when price was ~ 4.50. 

If something negative happens (news / launch failure) look at the spike on the price cost distribution chart below the one we are at now. That is what stock astrologers call support levels. Buy more then. Usually takes another negative event to break that one.

This is the easiest money I have ever made. I’m just a science teacher. Money for nothing is welcomed. 

You do you, but hope you make money. There is plenty to go around. Would hate to see institutions make that money instead of you all reading Reddit posts on a Thursday night.

RKLB MSR odds increased due to Elon’s recent actions. ,"I firmly believe that all of Elons recent shenanigans (getting very political very quickly, paying for votes, claims he’s talking to Putin, etc.) are only going to help RKLB. NASA administrator Nelson believes that these claims about Elon should be investigated and I believe there’s a growing anti-monopoly mindset around SpaceX right now in this industry. 

Therefore, I think that NASA is more likely to choose RKLB over SpaceX for MSR due to wanting to help get other launch providers up to a near-SpaceX level quicker. 

But they won’t just do this out of kindness, I also cannot see any other realistic candidate with RKLBs interplanetary track record. The only other real competitor (other than SpaceX) is BO and they just don’t have the resume for this. Unless their application was joint with many other organizations, I just don’t see them getting MSR. 

We should be thanking Elon for his stupidity. 

Fingers crossed we get this…

Mars Sample Return Mission Abstract - Rocket Lab's (former NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory) Richard French,"Everyone here has heard about the NASA Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission for which Rocket Lab is carrying out a study, which may lead to a NASA contract for either a full mission or some parts thereof. 

Let's take a look at Richard French, the Rocket Lab's man who is mentioned in the MSR studies abstracts of selected proposals published by NASA. Mr. French was mentioned in the Rocket Lab's news article of 2024/09/05 as a decorated NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) lead system engineer who, among other achievements, helped land the Curiosity Rover on Mars:, before moving to a managerial role at NASA HQ and later JPL's STO:

>Rocket Lab, the global leader in dedicated small satellite launch, has appointed Richard French to the role of Director – Global Government Launch Services. Joining Rocket Lab **following 12 years at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)**, Mr. French’s new role will see him focus on providing launch and on-orbit solutions for United States civil space customers such as NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as international civil space customers.

>In his previous role at NASA JPL, **Mr. French spent several years as an engineer working across various missions**, including the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission (for which he won the **NASA Honors Early Career Public Achievement Medal** for his work as **a lead system engineer**) **and** **helping to land the Curiosity Rover on Mars**. After moving into **a managerial role in the Space Technology Mission Directorate at NASA HQ, and then JPL’s Space Technology Office**, he made significant contributions in implementing public-private partnerships with companies like Blue Origin, Astrobotic Technology, and Made in Space, and helped stand up NASA’s first start-up accelerator program with Techstars.

>(...)

>“Richard’s extensive experience at NASA and his work on commercial and government partnerships made him the obvious choice to lead government services at Rocket Lab,” says Lars Hoffman, Senior Vice President – Global Launch Services. “Rocket Lab is proud to offer frequent, reliable, and streamlined launch services to small satellite operators, and I’m looking forward to seeing Richard expand on Rocket Lab’s premium experience for our government customers.”

>Mr. French says: “I’m excited for the opportunity to continue enabling government agency space missions, but this time from the industry side and with the leading dedicated small satellite launch provider. I’m looking forward to building on the already impressive capabilities of Rocket Lab for government missions and working with government agencies to better support the expansion of commercial space.”

To the Ones Sleeping on RKLB,"A few months ago I stumbled upon RKLB and it was hella low… but I never pulled the trigger. As of late it’s been moving and so naturally i’ve been looking into it more and more and wanted to get a feel for how it stacks up against the competition (This is just for people who are relatively new… very obvious info). Rocket Lab is up against companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and some smaller guys like Astra and Firefly Aerospace.
 
Obviously Musk is the big dawg of the commercial space sector, with a $210 billion valuation. They dominate the industry with cheap rideshare missions for small satellites, which is bad news for Rocket Lab since they’re targeting the same market. Pretty much…. SpaceX’s scale and success are the biggest threats to Rocket Lab, hands down…. especially with the funding they just pulled too.

Blue Origin, while worth around $12 billion because they have Bezos running the show, the company is absolute dogwater for now and 0 threat. They are yet to surpass a suborbital launch lmao.

Now, Astra and Firefly are smaller but focused on launching small satellites at low costs. They’re not doing as many launches as Rocket Lab, but they could be disruptive by offering cheaper alternatives in the future but for now it's nothing crazy.

One company in this whole commercial space industry that kinda made me pause was Virgins Orbit. To really understand Rocket Lab’s position, I started looking into Virgin Orbit’s story. Basically for some background, they were another promising company in the small satellite market, valued at around $200 million before going bankrupt in 2023. This got me thinking though… was Virgin Orbit ever worth more? Turns out, at its peak, Virgin Orbit was valued at around $3.7 billion because of the hype around their air-launch system.

That’s when I started to feel a little nervous. If Virgin Orbit, a company once worth billions, could go bankrupt, what about Rocket Lab? With a current valuation of $5.5 billion, it’s not that far off. Given how tough the space industry is (super high costs, tons of competition, substantial loss when things go bad, etc), it’s a fair question to ask if Rocket Lab could face a similar fate.

After digging deeper (GPT search is goated for this), I found some key reasons Rocket Lab is way more robust and unlikely to follow in Virgin Orbit’s footsteps:

* Unlike Virgin Orbit, which struggled with consistent operations and reliability, Rocket Lab has a proven record of successful launches. As of now, Rocket Lab has completed dozens of successful Electron launches, building customer confidence and expanding its market share. Looking at Virgin Orbit…. Basically they had only completed a handful of launches and faced way more technical issues. Rocket Lab's reliability in delivering payloads on time and at a competitive cost is a significant advantage over the difficulties Virgin Orbit experienced.  
* Rocket Lab is not solely dependent on launch services. It has successfully diversified into spacecraft design, satellite components, and satellite management services, which provide additional revenue streams. This strategic diversification helps mitigate the risks associated with relying solely on launch operations, which was one of Virgin Orbit’s weaknesses. Virgin Orbit primarily focused on air launch technology.  
* Rocket Lab has future projects like the development of the Neutron rocket, which will allow it to compete in the medium-lift launch market, giving it access to larger payloads and way more lucrative contracts. At this point… Virgin Orbit was still trying to establish itself in the smaller payload market when it encountered financial troubles (so they weren't even able to get past logistics). . Additionally, Rocket Lab has been working on reusability with Electron, which could further reduce costs and increase profitability over time, a significant factor that Virgin Orbit lacked.  
* Rocket Lab has raised significant capital and managed its finances well, with plans to grow its business strategically. Virgin Orbit, despite its initial $3.7 billion valuation, faced liquidity issues and struggled to raise funds, eventually leading to bankruptcy. Rocket Lab’s revenue has been growing steadily, and while it is not yet profitable, the company's long-term plans for increasing revenue through more launches, satellite services, and new rocket developments give it a clearer path to profitability than Virgin Orbit ever had.  
* The demand for small and medium satellite launches is growing due to the rise of satellite constellations for communications, earth observation, and defence. Rocket Lab is well positioned to capitalise on this, having established itself as a trusted provider. Virgin Orbit’s limited ability to scale and capture a significant portion of this growing market played a role in its downfall.

So yeah, while I had some initial concerns comparing Rocket Lab to Virgin Orbit’s downfall, it’s clear that Rocket Lab is in a much stronger spot

In response to the bears (aka the liberal arts bull case for RKLB),"A few days ago I had an exchange with a guy who posted various pics Archimedes vs Raptor rockets.   A link to the thread ( https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/s/HOahYRJsur ), but the guy’s comments were deleted either by himself or the mods(?).  

In any event, it started out as just one of any number of posts going on about space x being so far ahead that nobody can compete.  I think the poster was a provocateur but also argued in good faith.  I found him to be broadly representative of a demographic of investor whose biases (technical snobbery and industry experience) are commonly found in arguments against Rocket Lab.  I think that those points are worth further discussion. 

I’m NOT an engineer (and this poster snidely pointed this out, in response to my comment that I don’t care about Archimedes looking like a wiry mess compared to Raptor).  I’m also not a quant of any type.  I focus on soft factors - culture, broad market structure, political and social movements.  I am a liberal arts shit head investor, and am proud to be one.  I was on NVIDIA in early 2022 (after many techies, yes,  but still before the market as a whole) because I read some novels about AI and read about GPT 3.  Not to toot my own horn, but focusing on soft factors like “how will other people perceive this technology?” and “where are the potential bottlenecks in developing it?” and “what companies are critical to this but have relatively low overall public awareness?” were critical to pointing me to Nvidia.  Much of the same analysis points me to Rocket Lab.

“Rocket Lab is technically inferior to Space X”.  Nobody disputes this. I take it as a given.  There is a wide gulf.  But does it matter?  Only if the technological gap cannot be overcome in the long run.  Why would Space X have an insurmountable technological moat?  It could only be one of three reasons:

1. The tech is too hard to replicate
2. The talent for developing the tech will only be at Space X
3. Space X will drive its competitors out of business before they can attain technological parity. 

As to 1, this is not true.  Saturn V rockets have existed for like 50 years.  Building rockets is hard but it does not require any significant breakthrough in fundamental science to match Space X.  I think this is not controversial.  It’s a question of scaling, money, processes, quality control, not fundamental scientific knowledge. 

As to 2: the commenter argued something to the effect that given space X’s advantage, no engineer would want to work for RKLB. This , frankly , struck me as prime Boomer Logic.  We have seen time and again that top talent wants to take risks and get exposure to upside.  Yes many engineers like to work for a more established company, but many will simply want the challenge, glory, and financial rewards associated with working for start up (or in RKLBs case, a mature start up with room to run).  

As to 3: Beck himself often rightly points out that monopolies usually do not last in the long run.  While this is less true in extremely capital intensive industries , he is generally correct and his point is buttressed by 2 additional facts.  A) space is a national security issue and B) Space X is and must remain a privately held company ( if it is to continue to pursue its mars goal).

I asked the poster to tell me who controlled airplane manufacturing during World War 2.  He responded a small number of companies incestuously subcontracted with each other and later consolidated into a handful of mega contractors due to government intervention. He made my point for me.  Vital national defense concerns are never run by pure monopoly; oligopoly is the rule.  This is because the market is artificial.  The government cannot tolerate a single company having a chokehold on vital capacity such as launch and space systems manufacture.  It requires somewhat competitive bidding.  It requires redundancies.  It also requires its contractors to satisfy national security laws regarding sourcing, supply chain, secrecy, clearances, etc.  Rocket Lab has come farther than any of its direct competitors (other than, obviously, Space X) in terms of being able to satisfy the governments requirements and delivering a product that works as advertised.  At minimum, Rocket Lab can deliver components for other launch providers ; the best case is that it can be one of 3-4 major government contractors in terms of taking payloads into orbit. 

The private vs public structure is also quite important.  Public companies are subject to disclosure laws that do not apply to private companies.  Control is dispersed, not concentrated in one person or small group.  This is a superior governance structure for the purposes of winning public confidence and political support.  Space X cannot go public in the near term because its stated goal of going to Mars will be severely compromised by introducing any form of outside governance.  I do take Musk at his word; mars is THE objective. Thus, it must remain in the hands of an idiosyncratic billionaire with many political enemies.  All the more reason for US and world governments to foster competition and incubate alternatives. 

None of this is to say that rocket lab will come out as one of the favored group of competitors- it is still a long, hard road with a lot of risk.

SpaceX recently earned a large contract with the Department of Defence for $775 million.  However in the same article the DoD confirmed that Rocket Lab (as well as others) are expected to bid for future launches.  

From prior news releases, we all know Rocket Lab appears to have a good working relationship and recognizes it’s a major future business as they created a dedicated National Security subsidiary.

Phase 3 Lane 1 - Damn that’s some JUICY launch money ,"https://spacenews.com/spacex-secures-new-contracts-worth-733-5-million-for-national-security-space-missions/

Any newbs out there that don’t know this, RocketLab last year had had to punt being on boarded because they no longer had a credible path to launch in 2024.

I think it’s pretty obvious right now that a path to launch in 2025 is extremely credible and in a years time they should be scoring some of these contracts.

These are yearly awards, so for shit and giggles let’s say Neutron scores half these launches.

4 launches at probably 70 to 80 million (DoD are extra juicy compared to a standard 55 million dollar launch.) That revenue is what RocketLab has made this entire year so far. 

I get distracted dreaming about MSR and the current stock price, but Neutron scaling is such a big deal. So much Cheddar.

"All these posts about how RKLB is ""overvalued"".","I'm seeing so many posts about RKLB being overvalued. How it's not worth $5B today because it doesn't have the revenues to support that valuation. These posters are missing the point. You, I, analysts, pundits, space enthusiasts, or market experts don't decide what a stock is worth. Only the market decides what stocks are ""worth"". And currently it's saying that RKLB is worth 5B today not because of what it's actually intrinsically worth, but because that the chance of it being worth 25, 50, 100B+ in a few years is becoming more and more likely.

A lottery ticket is a piece of paper worth nothing intrinsically. You don't buy it for the value of the paper. You buy it because it comes with the opportunity for it to later actually be worth a large amount of money.

It's fine if you want to trade RKLB and try and call the tops and bottoms. Honestly I do that with about 5% of my position, it keeps me engaged with the stock price and I don't feel like I'm missing out on taking some profits. But I'm holding 95% of my position long term, because I know this stock will eventually start running and not slow down. RKLB is doing everything right and has proven itself over and over in the past. The general public is just starting to catch on.

Why companies like $RKLB succeed in G2M even though existing players have the stronger balance sheet,"Large companies often fail in emerging markets due to their inability to adapt to changing technologies, consumer preferences, or market conditions. Of the original 12 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in 1900, only two have survived. **U.S. Leather** dissolved in 1911, as the demand for leather declined with the rise of synthetic materials and changing manufacturing needs​. Similarly, **Tennessee Coal & Iron** was acquired by U.S. Steel during the Panic of 1907, as it struggled with financial instability and competition​.

**American Cotton Oil**, which later became part of Unilever, shifted focus from cotton oil to food and consumer products, but it initially failed to capitalize on emerging industrial and chemical trends​. **American Tobacco** lost its dominance due to anti-trust laws that split the Tobacco Trust in 1911, reducing its market share and power​.

**Distilling & Cattle Feeding** was a major player in alcohol production, but Prohibition in 1920 crippled the company, forcing it to pivot to chemicals and eventually become Millennium Chemicals, losing its original market​. **National Lead** shifted from lead production to titanium dioxide, but its failure to keep pace with environmental regulations and new technologies saw it lose relevance​.

We won't come by exact production numbers, but my educated guess is that they are currently producing about 1 engine per month.

In the Q2 earnings presentation they wrote that engine 2 were coming off the production line. 5 more were in production. And as Peter Beck wrote in context with the recent Archimedes video, engine number 3 already should fix the copper issue.

"If Trump wins, I'm selling.","I started thinking about the election and How it could affect Rocket Lab. And it dawned on me. Trump and Elon are best buddies. Of course Elon is going to use a Trump administration to kill off competition. Trump will direct every mission, NASA and DOD to SpaceX. He could even use the EPA to deny launch permits to any other company (who cares if it's BS, this is Trump world). This could kill Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, Axiom, Sierra, Relativity and any company that could compete with SpaceX in the future. This would be a tragedy for the whole industry that is just getting started. ULA will probably survive because they have been around the longest and have their own friends on capitol hill. But it will just be those two around SpaceX and ULA under Trump, that's my prediction.

On the Flip side if Kamala gets in I think they will actively divest from SpaceX wherever they can, due to Elon dislike. They'll be stuck using Dragon for a while because it's the most proven vehicle in the US (RIP Starliner). But I could see Dream Chaser getting another look from NASA.

A revelation I’ve come to realise,"One of the biggest unknowns we’ve had about Neutrons commercial success, is how well it will actually compete with Falcon 9. I for example, have always been hopeful, but a bit unsure about the fact that Neutron can only put 13 Tons into LEO in reusable configuration, compared to a much higher offering from Falcon 9.

Until the penny dropped that Falcon 9 is a mature design that’s been in production and service for well over a decade, and has seen many iterations and evolutions over it’s life.

I searched it up, Falcon 9s first ever iteration “v1.0” could only put 9 tonnes into LEO, and it wasn’t reusable. The second iteration “v1.1” could put 13 tonnes into LEO, and wasn’t reusable. It wasn’t until v1.2 came about in 2015 that it could then put 18.5 tons into LEO in reusable configuration and 22.8 Tons into LEO as an expendable rocket. It then later got refined into its next iteration “Block 5”, but it’s payload capacity stayed the same, and the en you’ve got Falcon Heavy which obviously has the higher capacities again.

So when you compare this to Neutron, it’s starting out brilliantly already. Considering Neutron is a foetus and Falcon 9 is a fully matured vehicle by now, and even so, F9 in its current state can only put 5.5 more tons into orbit than Neutron can (with both in LEO reusable configuration respectively). 

It’s safe to assume that as Neutron and Archimedes go through the development process and receive updates/iterations as it goes through its life and matures, that Neutron will be a very strong contender to Falcon 9. I mean, we already know that Archimedes in it’s current stage of life, will be operated at pretty low stress levels. And even at low stress levels, it’s starting considerably further ahead than where Falcon 9 started its life. Over the years of neutron being in service, when Rocket Lab refine and improve on their base design of neutron, when they learn more about Archimedes and how far they can push it whilst still being reliable to launch again and again and again, it seems safe to assume that Neutrons payload capacity will see decent payload improvements.

But my main point to realise is that Neutron is starting its life, leaps and bounds ahead of where Falcon 9 started its life, in terms of payload capacity and the fact that it will be reusable right from the outset. Obviously, this isn’t all down to Peter Beck masterclass, it’s been over a decade since F9 came to life, and technology has moved on since then. Still though, with this in mind, I feel a lot more confident about the argument of “How will Neutron compete with Falcon 9”. 

Will we see a neutron heavy? I doubt it but I’d love to be proven wrong in 5-10 years time. But with this in mind, not even taking into account that certain clients may pick rocket lab purely because it’s the only option that isn’t Elon Musk, AND the fact that Rocket Lab will offer end to end space services unlike SpaceX, AND the fact that Rocket Lab missions are tailored to their customers better and have a more precise orbit insertion, I think it’s pretty reasonable to assume that Neutron will at the very least, give Falcon 9 a good run for their money. 

The only thing that does still worry me slightly is that Falcon 9 has more than paid off for it’s self by now, so SpaceX will be able to price gouge/undercut Rocket Lab as much as they want (within reason), and Rocket Lab can only lower their prices so far to match it, after all, they have years of neutron service ahead of them to pay off the development costs.",59,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fttb0l/a_revelation_ive_come_to_realise/
Huge component of the business not yet factored into share price,"I wanted to point out something that others have mentioned before, particularly Vince is Bullish:

Peter Beck has said more than once that Rocket Lab is aiming to launch 50% of their rockets for customers and 50% of their rockets for themselves. This is because one of the primary purposes of their business is to create some sort of space infrastructure akin to SpaceX’s Starlink - some type of constellation that provides a service with high value for customers and high profit margins for Rocket Lab.

SpaceX’s valuation ballooned (almost doubled) to $200B since Starlink has come online.

When ASTS simply mentioned their constellation contract with AT&T, their market cap 10x’d in 3 months (before they had put anything into space).

Rocket Lab is fully vertically integrated (ASTS had to use a SpaceX rocket to get their first 5 satellites for AT&T into orbit). Once Rocket Lab is ready to begin building their own constellation, they’ll be able to do it at significantly lower cost than ASTS.

The only reason Rocket Lab’s price hasn’t moved on these repeated announcements of Peter Beck’s 50/50 plan for the company is that they haven’t announced exactly what their constellation will be yet.

But anyone that knows this company can pretty safely assume it’ll be a success that drives huge profits.

Remember, ASTS moved 10x on news of a constellation. Rocket Lab has announced a constellation too but there’s been zero movement (recent movement is due to other reasons like Neutron progress and price upgrades).

Once they announce the purpose of their constellation and provide a roadmap with more details, the stock could easily 2-5x in a handful of months. This will almost certainly occur simultaneously with the first successful flight of neutron or shortly after (6-12 months).

RKLB Short Term Bear Thesis (Long Term Bull),"The intention of this post is to outline why I consider RKLB to be an outstanding company with an overvalued stock price. I’ve been lurking on this sub for quite some time, and I frequently see people making bold price projections for RKLB’s future stock price with little to no substance backing up their estimates. That being said, I would like to provide a detailed breakdown for why I believe RKLB’s fair value is approximately $6 per share right now. This is a short term (1 year or less) projection, not a long term projection. I look forward to hearing your feedback and seeing where we differ in opinion.

*Let’s start with the good stuff. This encapsulates basically everything but the stock price.*

**Strong Leadership**
Peter Beck is exactly the right person to be running this company. He has the perfect blend of intelligence, charisma, and modesty to make the company as successful as it has been. The track record of successful launches that RKLB has achieved is a tremendous achievement for someone that, unlike his main competitors (Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, Elon Musk), does not have more money than god. I also see no concerning loss of senior talent, and I've seen an ability to attract new talent in recent months. Quality leadership is the most important thing I look for in an investment, and RKLB appears to have that in spades.

**Successful Track Record**
As mentioned earlier, the track record RKLB has achieved with Electron has been spectacular. 53 launches with minimal failures speaks volumes about the quality of the engineering talent at RKLB. Unlike many other people that have a negative take on RKLB, I actually don’t think that Neutron will struggle to reach a successful track record of launches and profitability. The recent hot fire test of the Archimedes engine was impressive, and it appears RKLB is on track to meet their goals with Neutron.

**Positive Catalysts**
There are several catalysts which I believe could completely annihilate my expectations for RKLB’s stock to decline in the near to mid term. First, an overall increased interest in the space industry from the market as a whole. Markets are always looking for the next hot thing, and it’s entirely possible space could be that. Just like artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, SPACs, etc., the space industry at large could see a significant uptick in investor interest. This could lead to an increase in RKLB’s multiple and stock price without necessitating an increase in revenue or profitability. Secondly and tangentially, an IPO of SpaceX could greatly increase RKLB’s visibility in the market. I believe a SpaceX IPO would cause a rising tide that raises all ships in the space industry, and RKLB would benefit. Lastly, I believe RKLB has a substantial amount of “meme stock” potential. The company’s name has been spreading within the forums of people that invest in meme stocks, and it’s possible RKLB could be the next big one as many of those speculators lose faith in GME, AMC, etc.

*Now let’s talk about the negatives.*

**Revenue/Profitability**
I believe it is fairly easy to project out RKLB’s likely profitability over the next 1-3 years, and I don’t expect to see many positive surprises on either top line revenue or bottom line earnings. Revenue is rising, but predictably, and I don’t see any significant catalysts for revenue to surprise on the upside. The revenue isn’t explicitly a negative as revenue growth has been strong, but the stock price relative to revenue is beginning to become unsustainable. 

RKLB became public in 2021 through a SPAC so we can’t too far back with their financials. In 2020 with seven Electron launches, RKLB had $35MM in revenue or about $6MM per launch.  In 2021 with six launches, RKLB had about $62MM in revenue or about $10MM per launch. In 2022 with nine launches, RKLB had $211MM in revenue or about $23MM per launch. In 2023 with nine launches, RKLB had about $244MM in revenue or about $27MM per launch. For the last 12 months (June 2023-June 2024) across twelve launches, RKLB had about $326MM in revenue or about $27MM per launch. These numbers show strong growth in launch count, total revenue, and revenue per launch. As we all know, most of RKLB’s revenue is outside of launch services, but their ability to launch successfully is critical for their future ability to generate revenue and profitability across all their business lines. For the first half of 2024, RKLB had about $200MM in revenue and they are projecting about $100MM in the third quarter. For the full year, I am assuming they settle in around $400MM in revenue for the year. Very solid revenue growth compared to 2023.

That’s all positive, but the stock price as compared to that revenue is overheated, from my perspective. Based on most recent valuations, it appears the market leader in RKLB’s industry is currently valued at about 23x 2023 revenue or 15x projected 2024 revenue. Obviously, SpaceX is a private company that is valued differently than in the public markets, but this multiple seems reasonable for the industry’s profit margins and growth expectations. I’m aware that RKLB’s business lines aren’t identical to SpaceX’s, but I believe Wall Street will utilize similar logic when establishing an appropriate multiple for RKLB. However, given SpaceX’s dominance in the industry and the significant amount of execution risk remaining in RKLB’s growth trajectory, it would be appropriate to apply a lower multiple to RKLB to account for this risk. At a stock price of $10 or a market cap of about $4.9BB, RKLB is trading at a 20x multiple on 2023 revenue or 12x expected 2024 revenue. From my perspective, this is not a large enough discount compared to SpaceX. I believe that RKLB’s multiple should be no more than half of SpaceX’s - 11.5x 2023 revenue or 7.5x projected 2024 revenue. This would equate to a market capitalization of $2.8BB to $3.0BB. This range of market capitalizations would equate to a stock price of $5.50 to $6.00 per share.

**Psychological $10 Barrier**
As previously mentioned, RKLB IPO’ed through a SPAC merger back in 2021 at about $10 per share. After experiencing a large but short-lived pump in the share price, the stock quickly dove down to the $4-$5 range where it stayed for years. Investors that entered a RKLB position at IPO or in the immediate run-up post-IPO are finally seeing an opportunity to exit the shares of a company that has done nothing for them for years as the S&P, Dow and Nasdaq have hit record highs. That being said, I think $10 will be a very difficult barrier to break both for practical and psychological reasons. The vast majority of companies that IPO’ed via a SPAC are still trading below their IPO price today. Increases in the share price above $10 are likely to be short-lived as we saw on September 30th, the first trading day after public confirmation of the successful hot fire tests of the Archimedes engine. 

**Conclusion**
In summation, I believe RKLB’s share price is experiencing a short term pump above what I’d consider to be a sustainable market capitalization based on their current and future revenue expectations. I expect the shares to return to $6 range before year end. I do not expect the shares to return to the $4 range. In the spirit of disclosure, I should mention that I previously worked for a private equity company that still holds a substantial stake in RKLB and SpaceX, but I was not directly involved in the private equity arm of the company so I had no special access to their investment theses or MNPI. I do still own approximately $50,000 in equity shares of my previous company. As it relates to more direct RKLB-related investments, I have a number of November 2024 put options with a $7 strike price that I paid approximately $.20 per share for. In the event my investment thesis plays out as I expect, I intend to convert the profits from the put options into an equity stake in RKLB with a holding period of 5+ years.

Why I think RKLB is a hold ,"I'm seeing a lot of new people popping up in this sub talking about gainz for ants. Y'all shortsighted motherfuckers. Look at the macro picture: 

1. US/China space race heating up. China is seen as a ""pacing challenge"" by the US military. Last time this shit happened during the Cold War, NASA spending reached 4.5% of federal budget. 

2. NO to monopoly. National security shit is not allowed to have a monopoly. Spacex will never be the only player. And it's valued at 200 bil, almost 50x what rklb is worth.

3. The huge TAM of space services in general. Lunar exploration, mars, LEO sats, spy sats, LEO experimental medicine, low gravity manufacturing etc. A lot of it is speculative you say? Well that's what investing in tech is about aye? You're looking for the NEXT BIG THING, not the last big thing. You might as well do GEICO and Coca Cola if you're of that bent. 

4. Actual working rocket and workable path to another big ass rocket. How many other companies you know put their money where their mouth is and can execute to a high level. Shit, even bezos is fking up with blue origin. I have more confidence in someone who has actually made a rocket fly, than some shit that's still on the pad. 

5. A good underpromise over deliver CEO. Sir Beck doesn't shoot his mouth off. Wanna know what that means? It means if he's anything like Musk, share price would be a multiple of what it is with hype. And I'm all for execute first hype later. 

6. Improving macro environment. Last time we had a massive reduction in rates after 08, there's a boom for 10 years. 2011 to 2021 were some of the best times in the market. Now with lower rates, you bet your ass the rotation into small and mid caps is gonna happen. Not least because lower rates make capital raising and debt obligations a lot more manageable. 

7. In other words, I fking love the stock. Positions: 
16326 shares @ 4.04 and 69 Jan 2025 calls.

Why would investing in RKLB be a good idea?,"""investing in technological revolutions is the least successful strategy""

Considering what is said in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZnVt\_CvL3k&ab\_channel=BenFelix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZnVt_CvL3k&ab_channel=BenFelix)

What are your counter arguments in support to holding RKLB long term (well beyond Neturon & profitability milestones)?

RKLB has high variance in possible outcomes in terms of return, hence by Jensen's inequality it must be overpriced currently.

RKLB is clearly in technological revolution category and while it may rise a lot in the near future, once it integrates into the economy and shifts from idiosyncratic to system risk, it may all deflate in the end.

Cash and equivalents after reaching $8.04,"Thanks to u/wfriedma for the reminder, that with the price over $8.04, the capped calls Rocket Lab purchased a while ago should now be relevant again.

This is all from memory, and from my understanding of things, so take it with a grain of salt, but I think the current share price should now mean that Rocket Lab has about $700 million in cash and equivalents (rather than the ~$500 million they had at the end of Q2).

This is because the convertible notes that Rocket Lab issued were for about 69 million shares with a conversion price of $5.13. So that was to raise about $350 million dollars, that they will eventually have to settle either with cash or the 69 million shares (or some combination of the two).

To try to reduce the possibility of the full amount of dilution needing to happen to settle/redeem the notes, Rocket Lab also bought call options capped at $8.04.

The idea with those call options was that they would allow Rocket Lab to settle the convertible notes entirely with cash, without needing to pay more than the original ~$350 million principal amount, and without needing to issue any shares, up to the point of the share price being $8.04. Any higher than that and they'd need to either issue shares as well to completely settle the notes, or pay more cash beyond the original ~$350 million plus the proceeds from the call options.

In other words, the point of the capped calls was to allow Rocket Lab to pay back ""for free"" to the holders of the notes the difference between $5.13 and $8.04 per share for ~69 million shares (obviously not actually for free, the capped calls cost something like $50 million), if the share price happened to be at $8.04 when the notes were due.

So by my understanding, that works out to a maximum of about $200 million in proceeds from the capped calls, which should have been available to Rocket Lab as soon as the share price was above $8.04, i.e. today.

Saying that ~$200 million will now be added to their balance sheet is not taking into account whatever value the calls had on their balance sheet at the end of Q2 though, so I would expect my $200 million number here could be a bit too high, but it should be in the ballpark.

But the main point is, Rocket Lab should be in a significantly better cash position now, because of this latest surge in the share price.",30,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fpih3t/cash_and_equivalents_after_reaching_804/

Anyone here holding LUNR and RDW aswell as RKLB?,"I’ve finally pulled the trigger and put some money in the space stocks, and I’ve gone for RKLB, LUNR and RDW, with RKLB being the biggest holding of the 3.

My train of thought was, the more these companies grow and develop, get more cash behind them, capture more share of the growing space market etc, that these 3 combined will be absolutely raking the contracts in. RKLB for launch and end to end space services, Redwire for development and construction of higher end speciality space tech (their space 3d printing will be a huge bread winner imo, and then all their general high quality infrastructure like their solar cells, robotic arms, cameras, sensors, RF transmitters, in space manufacturing, their space greenhouses etc), and LUNR could/will be the go to company for getting your things on to the moon surface which is essential and they’re one of the only ones offering actual payload delivery to the moon surface (can’t see many commercial avenues for this currently but now space is more accessible than ever, I predict that america will want to have some amount of control over the moon surface, before China gets there first, I’d imagine establishing moon dominance will become a bit of a strategic/geopolitical thing)

Obviously this is all wildly speculative and a very, very high risk play. But in the long run (im thinking 15 years +), if these 3 are still around by that point, they’ll be space giants and there’ll always be one of the three receiving a contract for something. Obviously spacex will be hoovering up contracts too, but I still think that in the long term, these 3 will be consistentently winning more and more contracts and are probably positioned to be giants in the market when it inevitably consolidates.

What does the next year look like for Rocket Lab?,"Hi all,

Despite having owned RKLB shares for a few years now (bought around $10 in 2021 alas) when the stock went down and ended up in the 'forget about it for a few years' corner of my portfolio I, well, forgot about it and took my eye off the ball.

Blue Origin New Glenn,"Imo this is the only major near term challenge for RKLB in terms of stock price. Per management, Blue is targeting 10 launches in 2025 and 20+ in 2026. Now that's obviously optimistic but given that New Shepherd has been successful (suborbital), it seems likely that Blue has the ability to reach orbit successfully. Whether it's 2025 or 2026, at some point pretty soon they'll be launching NG at decent cadence. Different from Stoke or Relativity which are doing interesting things but hasn't proven to to be able to go orbital which is as hard as making an engine (or harder). Most of these launches will be for Kuiper now and going forward so there's plenty of business left for Neutron. I'm not worried about that. But I do think that the probable success of New Glenn is a potential overhang on RKLB stock price appreciation. Thoughts?",8,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fj7arb/blue_origin_new_glenn/

3 Millionaire-Maker Space Stocks

Historically, space exploration and putting satellites into orbit has been within the purview of government-funded agencies like NASA.

That's changing, though. For-profit corporations can handle this work at least as cost-effectively as government-run organizations can. Elon Musk's SpaceX recently facilitated the world's first-ever private citizen spacewalk, for example, while Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is mainstreaming space tourism. Blue Origin's newest rocket will even soon be launching two Mars probes for NASA.

This is only the beginning of privatized work in outer space, now that technology not only allows for it, but necessitates it. Market research outfits Polaris and Precedence agree that launch services alone will be roughly a $50 billion-per-year business within a decade. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley and Citi both predict that the entirety of the science, technology, and services businesses linked to space will be worth on the order of $1 trillion by 2040.

Connect the dots. There's real investment opportunity here.

The top opportunities, however, aren't likely to be the obvious names. The potential millionaire-making space stocks are likely to be the lower-profile stocks that could even be considered a little off the radar. Here's a closer look at three of your better bets among such prospects.



Rocket Lab USA

It may not be a household name, but Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ: RKLB) has been very busy for quite some time now. Since its very first launch in May 2017, this company has put over 190 satellites into orbit. Its technology (like software, solar panels, radios, etc.) is also found inside more than 1,700 different satellites, as well as the James Webb Space Telescope. The two aforementioned Mars probes will also be flying with Rocket Lab tech on board.

While there's a clear market for satellite launches, Rocket Lab's been at it for a while. For any ticker to offer real millionaire-making potential, the company must mostly be undiscovered. That, or it needs to be doing something new that most investors don't yet fully appreciate. In this case it's the latter.

To date, all of this company's launches have utilized its so-called Electron rocket. It's perfectly fine for putting small satellites into orbit, but it's not powerful enough to lift larger satellites, exploration craft, or people into space.

That's coming, though. The Neutron rocket expected to start flying next year will be a so-called medium-lift vehicle capable of carrying bigger machinery. In fact, it will even be able to provide the initial liftoff for missions to Mars and Venus. The Neutron rocket will also be reusable, making it cost-effective for the company as well as its customers. Perhaps most important, the soon-to-launch Neutron rocket will provide real competition to SpaceX, which currently dominates the medium-lift market.

And interest is definitely firming up even before its first commercial flight. The U.S. Space Force has already provided funding to co-develop an upper stage of Rocket Lab's Neutron rocket as part of the Department of Defense's efforts to ensure it's able to secure and defend the United States wherever and however it needs to.



AST SpaceMobile

AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ: ASTS) isn't nearly as far along as Rocket Lab USA is on the commercialization front. In fact, the company only recently launched its first-ever commercial satellites. These certainly won't be the last, however, now that the underlying technology has been proven and perfected.

It's not an apples-to-apples comparison. Whereas Rocket Lab designs tech for others' satellites as well as a means of putting them into orbit, as the name implies, AST SpaceMobile offers mobile broadband connectivity via satellites rather than cellphone towers. This tech is capable of connecting anyone to the worldwide web regardless of where they are -- no physical infrastructure (other than a functioning, web-capable phone) required.

At first blush, it seems like a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. You likely don't have any trouble connecting to the web, whether that be with your phone or a computer. That's not necessarily the norm, however, and that line of thinking underestimates a growing challenge.

See, as the world becomes increasingly connected -- including our cars -- our telecom infrastructure is being pushed to its limits. Much of the developed world is now running low on radio frequencies to assign to mobile phones and cell towers. Offloading this data traffic to fiberoptic connections has certainly helped, but handling such constant switchovers en masse can be technically complex as well, and still won't fully meet future needs.

There's also the not-so-small matter that such connectivity frameworks are vulnerable to power outages and other sorts of disruption.

Satellite-based connectivity, however, sidesteps many of those problems. It's not exactly a new idea, either. Even if not always practical or affordable for the average consumer, satellite-driven mobile phone connectivity has been around since the 90s.

Now that it's practical as well as affordable, Polaris Market Research believes this market is poised to grow at an average annual pace of 18% through 2032. AST SpaceMobile is smack-dab in the middle of this mainstreaming movement.


Intuitive Machines

Last but not least, add Intuitive Machines (NASDAQ: LUNR) to your list of space-related stocks that could turn out to be millionaire makers.

In some ways, Intuitive Machines is the riskiest of the three stocks in question simply due to its small size and young age. Its market capitalization is a mere $375 million, and while it's now producing annual revenue in the same ballpark following its founding in 2013, it's also still operating in the red with only a little over $30 million worth of cash in the bank.

In other ways, though, Intuitive Machines is arguably the least risky of these three stocks just because it's also operating the most practical, currently marketable business. Simply put, this company is helping for-profit organizations and government agencies get back to the Moon. Whether that's drones that land on the Moon to map it or a means of putting communication satellites in a lunar orbit, Intuitive Machines has a solution.

It's prescient, too, given that the Moon has moved back into focus as the world's next space-exploration point of interest, perhaps as a place to mine or colonize, or perhaps as a test run for a manned mission to Mars.

Indeed, NASA's Artemis rocket designed specifically to return mankind to the Moon is still slated to do so sometime in the latter part of 2025 or 2026. This voyage will partially be made possible with the help Intuitive Machines has already provided and will provide in the future. The company recently announced a $117 million contract to deliver six different payloads to the Moon for NASA.

This is still just the beginning. Analysts believe growing interest in Moon trips will drive enough revenue growth for Intuitive Machines to push it out of the red and into the black by 2026. Reaching that milestone could easily send this stock on a rocket ride, so to speak.

Why I am staying put through the end of year in Rocketlab,"We are reaching the end of quarter. There is one more launch this week. With that being successful, we meet all expectations. Even this launch fails it's not a big deal. We have seen both failures and resilience in Electron launches. Resilience is always rewarded.

1. Increase in backlog or positive commentary on future launch opportunities 
2. These will be, well choreographed presentations. Very little risk

-“if we get to 2 launches per month that the sweet spot for electron, where we’re really get north of that 40% gross margin “

-“ I think we can get there (50% gross margin) without reusablity, before I had my doubts, but if we’re doing 30 launches a year I think we can pretty safely get their without reuseable “

-“I think reuseable probably add about 5% of margin improvements “

-“recover actually takes about 40kg worth of payload “",126,14,https://i.redd.it/b45807kdvfod1.jpeg
HASTE price tag?,"The other day Adam Spice mentioned the HASTE missions are the quickest growing stream in the electron portfolio.  I find this to be a very difficult business stream to get info on (I recognize many of the missions are confidential which may be why).  Does anyone know:
1) how much rocket lab charges for HASTE missions?  I’m guessing more than the $8.2m per launch for a standard electron rocket. 
2) exactly what the purpose of these missions is? It doesn’t seem like they’re payload missions deploying satellites for clients. I see many times they are defense-oriented but does anyone know exactly what that means? Are they ultimately going to be used as hypersonic missiles?  Testing for missile defense?  Don’t understand the use case for HASTE from the client side.

Question,"I live in Korea and in Korean sites, a number of people are concerned about RKLB because Trump said he will appoint Elon as ‘government efficiency commission’ if he becomes president.

Basically, they are worried because according to them(Koreans) Peter allegedly said that Elon is trying to suppress competitors like Rocket Lab in this field and that he is interfering w RKLB’s foothold in the industry by doing things such as lowering the launch price of the small-mounted vehicles etc.

As a result, Koreans w RKLB stocks are concerned about Trump being president since if Elon Musk takes up the government position, there is a very high possibility that he will use legal methods to push Spacex and suppress the competitions like Rocket Lab (according to them).

I want to ask if this is substantiated or just over-speculation/conspiracy by Koreans since I haven’t seen people in this Sub talk about this(or maybe you guys did and I didn’t see it).

The Intangibles are important - and its looking better for Rocket Lab,"I kinda feel sorry for SpaceX lately.  They have done some fantastic engineering and I’m sure have a lot of great people but their CEO and 50% owner has become a huge distraction.  The new private space race is in its infancy so a good head start isn’t enough.  Maintaining superiority in an industry over decades is difficult.  Do you know how many auto manufactures didn’t make it?  If you want to see what negative publicity can do to a superior product, go read the story of Preston Tucker or watch the movie.  

If Musk had just kept the problem to X, it would probably be fine but now he is using Starlink to defy the Brazilian Government.  I know that their government involved Starlink first but instead of backing down he is doubling down.  This could have long term ramifications if worldwide governments think Musk has no respect for their laws and start to put laws in place to limit his power in their countries.  I can guarantee these discussions are happening.  

The other problem for SpaceX now is their CEO decided to bet on one horse instead of just remaining neutral.  If his horse loses, there is no way he will see support from a Harris/Walz administration.  Musk is posting pictures of Harris as a Russian General…such a dumb move if you really want government contracts. I’m sure there are people in SpaceX that have left or are thinking of leaving because they don’t want to work for Musk anymore.  Again….that will benefit Rocket lab and Blue Origin and maybe a few of the other startups looking to scale quickly.

Blue Origin and Rocket Lab are poised to take advantage of these missteps by Musk.  That is why you see nothing about the election from Bezos and Beck because they are much smarter and know that to overtake SpaceX at this point you just put your head down and do the work.

I think they are making and developing chips for satellite operation / control and other various space craft in future))

Regardless of the semis / chips, the other aspects of the company are all notably exceptional. There are 4 ish various space craft at the moment (see video where Beck introduces the new names, it is funny)

 They have small launch fairly nailed, but more valuable and fully overlooked / not priced in is the “space systems” sector. Space companies that operate just satellites (like Iridium and ASTS) have market caps that dwarf Rocket Lab. Rocket Lab does what they do too…

Rocket Lab Owns 2/3 of the U.S. Launch Market -- That Isn't SpaceX,"https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/rocket-lab-owns-2-3-120000860.html

When Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB) reported second-quarter earnings last week, it ignited a multiday rally that sent its stock price soaring as much as 18%. And no wonder.

Sales at the small space rocket manufacturer soared 71% year over year, beating analyst forecasts. The per-share loss for the quarter was $0.08 -- not great -- but still better than the $0.10 loss that Wall Street forecast.

A historic quarter

In fact, Chief Executive Officer Peter Beck said Q2 was Rocket Lab's ""highest revenue quarter in company history"" -- no great surprise given that each succeeding quarter shows revenue growth. But Beck also said that Rocket Lab is seeing ""strong and growing demand for our launch services and space systems products,"" such as the Electron rocket, Photon kick stage spacecraft, and satellites built for the U.S. Space Force. The company is also making progress on new products to power profit in the future.

First and foremost among these are the new Neutron rocket, a medium-lift rocket that, in a unique twist on traditional design, encapsulates its second stage within a reusable first stage with an integrated (and also reusable) payload fairing.

In last week's press release, Rocket Lab highlighted the recent successful first hot fire test of the Archimedes engine, nine of which will be used to power Neutron's first stage. Four days later, Rocket Lab posted a ""how it started, how it's going"" photo comparison on X first showing CEO Beck standing next to a mockup of the then-just-announced Neutron concept vehicle, side by side with a completed half-fairing for a real-life Neutron rocket.

What's more, just one day earlier, Rocket Lab announced its 10th mission so far this year, the launch of a Capella Space satellite to orbit atop an Electron rocket. Crucially, this was the first launch for Capella since September 2023, when an anomaly in an Electron rocket's second stage resulted in a loss of the payload. The fact that Capella maintained its faith in Rocket Lab -- and that faith was vindicated with a successful launch over the weekend -- has to come as happy news for Rocket Lab shareholders.

SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and ULA -- in that order

So yes, it's been a busy few days for Rocket Lab, and jam-packed with good news. Now here's some less good news.

According to Beck, Rocket Lab's Electron has become ""the most frequently launched small rocket globally."" And so far this year, Rocket Lab is responsible for ""64% of all non-SpaceX orbital U.S. launches in 2024 to date."" That sounds impressive, but it comes with a big caveat. SpaceX orbital U.S. launches already number 79 (and probably more by the time this article publishes). Meanwhile, Rocket Lab's 64% amounts to only 10 launches total.

That actually gives you a better idea of the distance between No. 2 rocket launcher Rocket Lab and No. 3 United Launch Alliance (ULA has launched four times this year, making up about 28% of non-SpaceX orbital U.S. launches), than of how close Rocket Lab is to overtaking SpaceX.

Hint: It's not even close. For the foreseeable future, the great American space race is going to remain with SpaceX as No. 1, then a big gap with everybody else.

The race for No. 2

Investors also need to be aware that Rocket Lab faces some serious competition even in the race to remain No. 2 to SpaceX.

Don't get me wrong. Rocket Lab is accelerating its launch cadence. Its revenue is accelerating. And there's a very real chance Rocket Lab will turn profitable in the next year or two. Still, now that United Launch Alliance has its new Vulcan rocket operational, it's moving quickly to regain its traditional role as one of America's leading launch companies. As I pointed out earlier this month, ULA currently has 23 Vulcan rockets in various stages of construction, and ULA CEO Tory Bruno is promising investors he will launch 20 times next year, and 25 times in 2026.

With 10 launches under its belt already in 2024, and more on the way, Rocket Lab could still out-launch ULA, and remain America's No. 2 launch provider in the future. But ULA is definitely going to try and give Rocket Lab a run for its money.",152,13,https://i.redd.it/h1c1fwpaemkd1.jpeg

What's going on with RKLB ?,"RKLB suddenly sky rocketed from $5.25 to $7.36 (excluding EXT hrs) starting last Friday. The move is significant because

1. It happened with volume that was the highest is the last 3 months
2. A follow through on the following day with twice the volume.

I am trying to figure what's behind the move. Any inputs would be appreciated.

So far, the theories are

1. ""One man's loss is another man's gain"". United Launch Services is actively seeking buyers. Blue Origin had issues at their factory.
2. VK Services LLC, distributed about 14M shares to their Partners. This is also good news. Venture Capitalists don't give junk to their Partners 
3. Interest rates are going down.
4.  WBS/Meme stocks are back in vogue.
5.  Space is the new trend. ASTS is up >10x this year.

Quoted from Tim:
$RKLB Supplier issues for the SDA program whereby supplier Mynaric has production delays of CONDOR Mk3 caused by lower than expected production yields and component supplier shortages of key components. Remaining cash & cash equivalents on hand is 6.3 million EUR. 🤯 

Headache or golden acquisition opportunity for Rocket Lab? Acquisition price will be down significantly. Adam Spice is probably already packing his suitcase 😉

Company is now valued around 41 million, even with a 20% premium Rocket Lab has the chance to add a key piece of technology to the payload spec. They don't come cheaper then this! Adam you have my blessing, lets open the warchest!

We all know how much Sir Peter Beck loves a bargain!

FAQ for RKLB For new WSB people (fixed) thanks chatGPT,"**What do they sell?**  
Rockets, satellites, hardware, and software.

**How were they listed?**  
SPAC. They had a peak at $18.

**Who is the CEO?**  
Sir Peter Beck.

**Wait, the CEO is knighted?**  
Yes, he's a New Zealander.

**Wait, the CEO of a significant aerospace company is a New Zealander?**  
Yeah, that's why it's unusual. It shows his intelligence in achieving something no one expected.

**Who are their competitors?**  
SpaceX, Blue Origin, Firefly, Stoke, and technically Astra.

**Wait, I only know two of those.**  
Two have never launched, and two haven't launched for ages.

**Wait, didn't one of those companies also get listed and then delisted?**  
Astra did that, and Virgin Orbit too, until they filed for Chapter 11.

**Ok, cool. What are Rocket Lab's competitive advantages over SpaceX and Blue Origin?**  
With Electron, smaller satellites that need to be launched sooner and to closer locations can be cheaper and more profitable over time compared to delays.

**Wait, why does their revenue recognition change so often over quarters?**  
Revenue for launches can only be recognized at launch, with 90% paid by launch day.

**How many launches are needed on Electron per year to be profitable?**  
Around 21.

**Wait, they didn’t launch that many per year.**  
First, consider revenue recognition. Delays are primarily on the client side.

**What is Neutron?**  
A significant new rocket that can lift up to 13 metric tons.

**How much does R&D for this cost?**  
It's supposed to be around $300 million. It might cost more.

**Wait, that’s a lot.**  
Yes, but relatively speaking, it's cheap. The Falcon 9 cost around $390 million in 2011.

**When will it launch?**  
Mid next year.

**How far along are they in development?**  
They've tested the engine.

**What about their other business activities?**  
Are they doing recovery?  
Soon.

**I’m glad you asked about satellites and space systems. These are high-revenue lines, profiting under SolAero and Sinclair, and selling carbon composites.**

**What do those do?**  
Star trackers, ion propulsion, solar panels, separation systems, and solar panels.

**How did they acquire these companies?**  
M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions).

**Wait, that’s like shopping for companies?**  
Yes, it's hinted that they may buy something for a new constellation.

**Who are their customers?**  
NASA, DOD, Space Force, and commercial customers.

**Wait, the financial statements say they’ve got convertible notes.**  
Yes, they have debt that can become shares.

**Great, are there any cons?**  
Yes.

**What are they?**  
Risk of a launch failure, delays in Neutron, and onerous legislation.

**Ok, what’s the ticker?**  
RKLB.

**Is there anything else?**  
Yes, I recommend reading *When the Heavens Went on Sale* and watching *Wild Wild Space*, which discusses Rocket Lab, Astra, Planet Labs, and Firefly.",67,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1ewizrn/faq_for_rklb_for_new_wsb_people_fixed_thanks/

What many people miss about Rocket Lab,"I have seen a lot of posts on here and WSB that only discuss the launch side of Rocket Lab.

Rocket Lab is not just a launch company. They are way more than that. They are an end to end space company.

Take a look at these scenarios below.

Company X( basically all companies that need something in space to operate. Use ASTS for example): These companies design and build something that operates in space, but rely on another company to get their equipment there.

SpaceX: launch provider with an emphasis on launching their own constellation with further goals in space. We all know they can launch themselves.

Rocket Lab: started as a launch only company with Electron but have heavily diversified their business into space systems. Their business offers the ability to design, build, launch and operate a customers satellites or space craft or maybe their own constellation someday. This is why it is called end to end. Their business is not launch, launch is only one of their tools to more effectively do business in space. Neutron will not make or break this company. They do not rely in its success to make them profitable. They could stop development today and still be profitable in the future due to the way they have positioned themselves in the industry through their space system business segments. This type of position is going to be huge in the future as more people move their business into space.

I have followed this company for 3 years and they continue to impress me. Though launch is a very exciting part of this business, since it is really the only one we can see, I encourage every investor here to start viewing this company as an all around space company instead of just a launch company.

Polaris Dawn should help all Space Companies,I know that is it a SpaceX mission but this should help Rocket Lab as well.

It will be talked about on the news all day long.  It will be front page articles every day.  Space is going to be the #1 topic for the 5-6 day mission.  Some of those articles are going to mention Rocket Lab and Blue Origin for sure.  Anything that gets people excited about space again is something that can help the company and the stock.  It is like with Nvidia and AI….and how every company after that said AI in their earnings call.

Rocket Lab Acquisition / Constellation Analysis,"# Hey r/RKLB, just wanted to share some analysis I've been doing on potential acquisition targets.

Rocket Lab's track record with acquisitions follows a fairly well-defined pattern. Let's take a look at the companies they have purchased thus far:

* **SolAero Technologies** - $80m - Dec '21 - Provider of high performance solar panels - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-space-solar-power-products-company-solaero-holdings-inc/)
* **Planetary System Corp (PSC)** - $42m + 1.7m shares - Dec '21 - Provider of separation systems - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-space-hardware-company-planetary-systems-corporation/)
* **Advanced Solutions Inc (ASI)** - $40m - Oct '21 - Flight software, mission sim, and guidance + nav software - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-acquires-space-software-company-advanced-solutions-inc/)
* **Sinclair Interplanetary** - $ Unknown - Apr - '20 - Satellite components (reaction wheels, star trackers, etc) - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-satellite-hardware-manufacturer-sinclair-interplanetary/)

Here is a section of an interview with CEO Peter Beck explaining the methodology behind Rocket Lab's acquisitions: [https://youtu.be/T\_\_1ubfs\_iE?t=1313](https://youtu.be/T__1ubfs_iE?t=1313)

* ""If the supply chain can not provide us the surety to deliver what we need, then we’ll go and vertically integrate""
* “If it’s too expensive and it’s too slow, generally we need to own it because we can make it cheaper and faster”
* ""Is this going to be strategically important to us in the future for stuff that we think we're going to do""

To summarize, Rocket Lab's acquisitions have all been vertical integration plays; bringing some aspect of their supply chain in house to either reduce lead times, unit cost, or both. Peter has mentioned in multiple interviews that all of these companies have scaled and integrated successfully into Rocket Lab's business.

Note how most of these acquisitions support the production and manufacturing of satellite **buses**. A quick review: satellites can be described as being comprised of a **bus** and a **payload.**

**Bus** - the main structure and infrastructure of a satellite, providing the necessary support systems for the payload to operate effectively. It includes power, structure, solar panels, propulsion, thermal control, attitude control, communication, and on-board computer systems.

**Payload** - the primary instrumentation or equipment on a satellite that performs the specific mission or function, such as sensing, communication, or experimentation, and is the reason the satellite is launched into space.  
  

Rocket Lab can currently produce satellite buses quickly, cost effectively, and at scale. Payloads? Not so much. 

# I think Rocket Lab's next acquisition will be a payload company. A company that specializes communications equipment, imaging/sensors, etc.

It's been clearly communicated by leadership that Rocket Lab plans on building a LEO constellation. If/when they do announce an acquisition of a payload company, we will be able to make some pretty big assumptions about the type of constellation they will build.

I do not think Rocket Lab will build out a direct to consumer mega constellation a la Starlink or Kuiper based on the following:

* Starlink's original estimated cost to design, build and deploy was $10 Billion  [source](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/05/block-5-spacex-increase-launch-cadence-lower-prices/)
* Amazon reportedly invested $10 Billion in the Kuiper project in 2020 [source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/fcc-authorizes-amazon-to-build-kuiper-satellite-internet-network.html)
* Comments from CFO Adam Spice :

>""the broadband from space application that SpaceX targeted with Starlink, that's probably not what we will be going for just given the amount of capital required"" [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=1059)

>""but there's lots of very interesting applications that required dozens or hundreds of satellites not 40 thousand satellites"" [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=1070)

While it's possible they could pursue a smaller 5G constellation similar to AST SpaceMobile, I think AST's tech moat is wide enough that other opportunities make more sense.

# I think it's likely that we see a smaller 100-200 satellite constellation purpose built and marketed towards military applications.

These satellites could provide access to a suite of sensors, communication systems, radar, antennas, etc., and deliver tailored services to DoD customers. A few points supporting that:

* Rocket Lab is prime DoD contractor as of Dec '23, acting as prime for the $515m SDA Tranche 2 Transport Layer - Beta contract. According to Adam Spice this:

>""opens up a lot of opportunities for us"" .. ""we think it's a huge enabler to grow that government exposure"".  [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=515)

* Sitting Board member Nina Armagno, among many other things, **was the first director of staff of the United States Space Force** and was responsible for helping to establish the organizational framework, policies and procedures, building relationships with other branches, etc.  [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/about/team/)
* The business is already heavily focused on gov customers. SDA, ESCAPADE, HASTE, CAPSTONE, TROPICS, etc, all make up a huge chunk of rocket lab's revenue already.

# Ok. So if it's likely that the acquisition is a payload company, and it's likely that the payload would be for a constellation built for servicing DoD customers, I think I know where to look...

# [Here is a list of subcontractors that Rocket Lab selected to help fulfill the SDA contract](https://spaceimpulse.com/2024/05/07/rocket-lab-selects-subcontractors-for-sda-satellite-constellation/#:~:text=The%20selected%20subcontractors%20include%20CesiumAstro,Redwire%20Space%2C%20and%20Parsons%20Corporation)

What do you know, a bunch of **payload** companies (mostly).

* **CesiumAstro** - $260-390m [source](https://app.dealroom.co/companies/cesiumastro) - will provide its Vireo active electronically scanned array (AESA) radio frequency (RF) communications payload, known as the first multi-beam-capable Ka-band communications system for SDA’s PWSA.
* **Mynaric** - $93m Mkt Cap - will supply CONDOR Mk3 optical communication terminals, enhancing free space optical communications for air, space, and mobile applications.
* **Redwire Space** - 450m Mkt Cap - has been chosen for its expertise in antennas and RF hardware.
* **Parsons Corp** - 10b Mkt Cap - will provide the NEBULA Operations – Vendor Architecture (NOVA), serving as Rocket Lab’s ground system for the operational management of its 18 satellites.
* **SEAKR Engineering** - Acquired by Raytheon - will offer its Tactical Satellite Communications (TACSATCOM) Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Network Encryption System (NES).
* **Collins Aerospace** - Acquired by Safran Group -  is set to deliver the waveform necessary for the SDR, essential software and firmware for TACSATCOM’s transmission and reception.

# Cash Situation

Rocket Lab's current Cash and Equivalents and marketable securities etc is $546.8m ([source - slide 37](https://s28.q4cdn.com/737637457/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/FINAL-Rocket-Lab-Q2-2024-Earnings-Presentation.pdf))

All the previous acquisitions have been in the $40-80m range (Sinclair likely less)

Adam Spice gave guidance in the Q2 '24 earnings call that capex for Neutron R&D was expected to tick up in the in the second half of 2024 [source](https://youtu.be/lE9SPN_bIhc?t=3634)

Adam Spice on whether they would do another cap raise - ""Right now we don't see anything that would cause us to go back to capital markets"" but did provide a caveat that for the right opportunity, it's a possibility [source](https://youtu.be/lE9SPN_bIhc?t=5751)

So it's not likely they would raise capital for an acquisition, but it's also not off the table.

Obviously the last three subcontractors on the list aren't an option, and $450m for Redwire seems a bit steep given the cash on hand. **Mynaric** and **CesiumAstro** both fit the profile and around the price range we are looking for.

Do I think one of these companies will be acquired by Rocket Lab? **I don't know**.

Do I think a company *like* Mynaric or CesiumAstro will be acquired by Rocket Lab? **Yes.**

Here's a few predictions:

* I think the first constellation Rocket Lab builds will be less than 200 satellites
* I think it will be purpose built to serve the DoD, possibly partnering with a branch to actually fund the first tranche of satellites
* If there is an acquisition, I feel very confident that it will be a payload company
* Without a cap raise, I think $100m is the most we could afford to spend on an acquisition (assuming no Neutron delays etc)

Some thoughts ,"Hi RKLB family,

I've decided to buy some stock after doing research. I won't be buying a lot due to limited funds (poverty)

Given the recent price jump, likely due to hype and FOMO I plan to wait for a potential dip in the coming days before investing. Hopefully, I won't end up buying at a high price like $10.

I believe in Rocket Lab's potential in the space industry but also want to be cautious about when I enter my position. Honestly, one thing that I realized that it would be wise in the future to hold some stock so when the hype train arrives I could sell some and then buy more after it mellows out.",22,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1euo8d4/some_thoughts/

Everyday Astronaut video about New Glenn,"This post is actually about Rocket Lab & Neutron, not a Blue Origin advertisement.

I really highly recommend watching Everyday Astronaut’s latest YouTube video with Jeff Bezos & New Glenn Factory. It confirmed three things I’ve personally thought are Rocket Labs clear advantages with Neutron.

1. Carbon composite gives you best performance and is clearly the best material choice. Downside to this is iterating the rocket design is not realistic so you have to get it right with the first design. Rocket Lab already did exactly this with Electron.

2. Reusable fairings attached to the 1st stage are an excellent idea to reduce cost.

3. If you can make the 2nd stage cheap enough, you will never have to deal with the problems that a reusable 2nd stage will have. Blue Origin is also attempting this. They’re (in parallel) designing a reusable 2nd stage and another ”as cheap as possible” expendable 2nd stage. Bezos said if they can make the expendable 2nd stage very cheap, then it doesn’t make economical sense to attempt to reuse it. 

What are these 2nd stage problems I mentioned? Look at what Starship has to deal with on re-entry. Combine that with the extra weight of the stainless steel, fuel, heat shielding that is required to make it reusable. That’s weight that could be used to deliver extra payload to orbit. (I know I know, Starship is designed for interplanetary travel etc. so re-entry is a requirement)

Rocket Lab is purely going for a 2nd stage that is as cheap and as light as possible. I think this will prove to be the right choice. There’s a lot of reasons why and are mostly related to economics and performance of the overall vehicle.

For example the empty weight for the 2nd stage of a Falcon 9 is 3900kg. Peter Beck has stated the 2nd stage of Neutron is roughly the same weight as a Harley Davidson motorcycle so around 300-400kg. That’s a big difference.

After watching the video I have a lot more respect for Jeff Bezos & Blue Origin. On a related note, Blue Origin is scheduled to launch two spacecraft built by Rocket Lab to Mars next month (unless there’s a delay)",49,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1eufya5/everyday_astronaut_video_about_new_glenn/
Simple DD for Newcomers.,"RKLB builds satellites and rockets currently it has operational Electron small launch rocket with over 50 launches. They are working on a big rocket called Neutron which will be Reusable. As well as a suite of various satellites.

What is a reusable rocket and why is it important?

Most rockets ever to exist have been expendable, meaning they get destroyed or become museum peices. Imagine the cost of an airplane ticket if you had to build a 747 airplane fly across the world and trash the 747 every time. That's basically what humanity did until SpaceX proved it was possible to land rockets with Falcon 9. The concept has been proven. Rocket Lab along with a few others are chasing this dream. Since SpaceX landed Falcon 9 and became reusable no one has been able to duplicate this and the company is now worth 210 billion market cap, they are in first place a huge leap ahead of everyone.

Furthermore, Rocket Lab builds the satellites for many of the launches, satellite components and has a huge space systems division and sells a service, which means they scoop up way more profit margin. They are far ahead all others (excluding SpaceX) and plan to launch the first Neutron mid 2025 and will become profitable shortly after. 

Neutron will be designed to be reusable from day 1 where Falcon 9 was not which will give them a big advantage in design. 

RKLB is only valued around 3.2 billion to SpaceXs 210 billion. Pennies on the dollar and most agree it is wildly undervalued right now. 

So, proof of concept has been established by SpaceX, Rocket Lab has tons of space and launch experience with their Electron Rocket being the second most frequently launched rocket. They have hundreds of millions in cash reserves to finish the development, the Archimedes engine that powers Neutron has just fired up for the first time recently after 3 yesrs of hard work and engines are the longest lead time in building a rocket. No other company is in a more perfect position to become and remain the #2 space company in the world. Once Neutron is successful and launching, this company should easily be worth 20-50 billion dollars ($45-$100 stock price) fair value still a fraction of SpaceX, they will be able to launch their own mega satellite constellations.

The CEO and Founder Peter Beck is an absolute genius, self taught rocket scientist and has been regarded as such by many influential people in the industry.

Why Rocket Lab’s Q2 Was Better Than Everyone Realized,,37,1,https://youtu.be/3mJZsHyEMKU
Will RKLB's share price double this year? - Re-revisiting my post from 2024/04/29,"Today, on 2024/08/16, RKLB reached $7.10, more than doubling from its YTD low of $3.47 on 2024/04/16. Hell yeah!

  
[My old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cfjtco/will_rklbs_share_price_double_this_year/) from 2024/04/29 follows below:

RKLB share price has a history of doubling from its low during the summer and then falling down to repeat the process next year. So far, it has happened every and each year since its listing on the stock market:

* **2021: $9.5 to $21.34 from 2021/08/27 to 2021/09/09**
* **2022: $3.53 to $7.15 from 2022/06/30 to 2022/08/12**
* **2023:** **$3.76 to $8.05 from 2023/05/09 to 2023/07/19**

The 2024 low has been reached on 2024/4/16 at $3.47. What has changed from previous years besides the company's increased performance is that **the reported short interest YTD has increased by 161% from 22m to 58m shorted shares**. This huge increase right before the summer may cause a bound of a violent volatility once the 2024 doubling commences.

RKLB trades so cheaply and it is so heavily shorted that all that may be needed to revalue its stock is a shift in sentiment. Right now the stock is pricing in the most bearish of bearish outcomes. Delayed Neutron development, increased R&D costs and Electron's obsolescence. But Rocket Lab is the only space company dedicated to being a one stop shop for space applications. Suppose over this year, the management can craft a narrative that Neutron is really coming this year/early next year and with it a significant decrease in R&D costs and the growth and capture of launch and space system markets. Such sentiment shift may take time but I don't know, there are so many unusual factors with Rocket Lab that I could see it happening rapidly.

I am not betting that Rocket Lab is going to stage the most epic growth of all time. I am just betting on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06).
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year.

Peter Beck and Rocket Lab have an opportunity…and seem to be playing it right.,"This isn’t to get too political…it’s about business but also how politics plays an important role in the success of space focused companies.  Everyone here knows that Space X is the current leader in the industry.  They have a solid infrastructure, some good engineers, and have done a great job so far.  They got an early lead and were well on their way to being the leader for decades to come.  Something similar could be said for Tesla.  However, in the early stages in a new industry, big mistakes can be extremely costly.  In the case of Tesla, the focus on the cybertruck and electric semi’s has cost a fair amount of Cap ex and no revenue.  Cybertrucks are sitting on lots and in fields and if you follow the Reddit r/cyberstuck you can see that they are basically hot garbage.  Teslas were incredibly successful at first but the constant price decreases and increases have turned some people off from buying again.  On top of that, and more importantly, Musk himself has alienated his largest consumer base with his anti-California, anti-lgbtq, etc…nonsense.  If there is one thing most successful CEOs will say is keep your loyal customers happy.  Tesla’s share of EV sales has dropped from 75% in 2022 to just under 50% in 2024.  

But, this is about Rocket Lab.  Space companies are going to continue to rely on government contracts along with the private sector.  For U.S. contracts, the company has to be based in the U.S. and meet specific security requirements.  There are only a couple of companies that can do that.  Over the next decade, the space industry should see phenomenal growth.  One company will not provide all the services.  The contracts will be split between multiple companies.  When it comes time to award those contracts, ability and consistency will play a huge role and also reputation.  Beck has done a fantastic job of being politically neutral.  He just gets the job done.  Musk on the other hand has decided to back one horse whole-heartedly and there will be a price to pay for that.  If his candidate loses, along with the trepidation congress already feels about how much power and influence he already has, it could be an opportunity for Rocket Lab to grow with huge contracts.  They just have to get Neutron to be successful.  If Kuniper turns out to have better technology then Starlink and if ASTS technology takes market share since a lot of people just want their phone to work in remote areas and not carry around an entire dish, then that could slow Starlink growth.  Space X will continue to be successful due to Starship but they are not guaranteed the top spot forever now.  

Hang onto your stocks my friends.  It is going to be a wild ride into space in the years to come.   ",73,9,https://i.redd.it/ga8vuv0dvtid1.jpeg
Post-Neutron profitability ,"Given that Space X and Blue Origin either have or are developing larger rockets than Neutron, I wonder if Rocket Lab will need to start developing a larger rocket than Neutron in order to compete. I’m wondering if this means that instead of becoming profitable, they’ll need to start investing heavily in further research and development of a larger rocket as soon as Neutron is up and running in order to stay competitive.

Rocket Lab Stock Soars. Space Has Momentum.

Commercial space company Rocket Lab RKLB 12.58% posted stronger quarterly sales Thursday evening, sending shares soaring. Rocket Lab, like Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has space launch and satellite-building capabilities. SpaceX, of course, is dominant, launching almost 80 times so far in 2024. Rocket Lab has launched nine times. Investors don’t get regular quarterly updates from Musk’s privately held space company. That isn’t the case with publicly traded Rocket Lab. For the second quarter, Rocket Lab reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, of negative $21 million from sales of just over $106 million. Wall Street was looking for an Ebitda loss of $26 million from sales of just under $106 million. Better cost control, resulting in a smaller-than-expected loss, is a positive. So are higher sales. Rocket Lab’s second-quarter sales grew about 15% compared with the first quarter and more than 70% year over year. The results sent Rocket Lab shares up about 12.6% in Friday trading to $5.37 apiece. The S&P 500 SPX 0.47% and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA 0.13% gained 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively. Following the report, Stifel analyst Erik Rasmussen wrote that launch demand remains strong and that sales should jump higher in the fourth quarter following relatively flat third-quarter sales of between $100 and $105 million. Rasmussen projects $121 million in fourth-quarter sales, up more than 100% year over year. He projects 2025 sales of about $576 million, up 36% from expected 2024 sales. Rasmussen projects positive Ebitda for the company in 2026, after sales hit almost $1 billion. He rates Rocket Lab shares Buy and has a $9 price target for the stock. Through Friday trading, Rocket Lab shares were down about 4% year to date.Shares of space start-up Virgin Galactic SPCE 2.16% are down about 87% this year, despite a 14% jump on Thursday. The company reported second-quarter sales of $4.2 million on Wednesday evening. Wall Street was looking for $3.4 million. Galactic focuses, of course, on space tourism. While better-than-expected sales are positive, ramping up capacity has been harder than the company expected. Rocket Lab has had more success providing launch services for companies looking to deploy small satellites into low-earth orbit. Coming into Friday trading, Galactic’s market capitalization was below $200 million. Rocket Lab’s was north of $2.3 billion. SpaceX dwarfs them both. It’s valued at some $200 billion in private markets.

_____________________________________________________

Rocket Lab had another successful launch this morning.   Just watched them successfully deploy the Capella satellite.  I think we see $10 by the end of the year.  I also think there might be more consolidation in the space industry.  Everyone knows that to compete with Musk you have to grow as fast as possible.  I wouldn’t be surprised to see more U.S. government contracts announced for Rocket Lab.  Boeing has really dropped the ball with leaving the astronauts stuck in space.  They are not getting any contracts until they bring them home unless one of their paid servants in congress really pushes for more money for Boeing.  If two of the big companies don’t combine in the next 12 months I’ll be surprised.  ",97,48,https://i.redd.it/rgqb4oh2o1id1.jpeg
"Manifest Space interview with Andy Lapsa, Stoke Space CEO (2024-07-25)","As another up and coming potential competitor to Rocket Lab, I thought people might find this interview from a couple of weeks ago worth listening to:

https://open.spotify.com/episode/3IpviNvEIcPEIQr6mrFIoB?si=IDhsKoiHR8mzJ0HN1i7r_Q

Given Stoke are aiming to be a launch only company at this point, I don't think the threat from these guys is too much at this point in time, although Andy did make a comment in the interview that I took as a bit of a sign that they're aiming to progress beyond launch, once they've got launch itself nailed down.

For those who don't know, Stoke are the company aiming to create a fully and rapidly reusable medium lift rocket (on the lower side of medium lift) called Nova. That might sound unlikely for a startup to achieve, but I've got a huge amount of respect for this company and the founders already.

First of all because they just sound like they know what they're doing, but also and probably more importantly because:

- They've already built and started testing a full flow staged combustion cycle engine in just a couple of years since first funding (an insane achievement)
- They've got an actual (and innovative) plan for how to make their second stage reusable, with a novel engine and actively cooled heatshield design
- On top of that they've also been testing development hardware already (doing hop tests) for that second stage

They are privately funded, not a public company to invest in, but I definitely think they're one to keep an eye on, if for no other reason than to keep an eye on as a Rocket Lab competitor (though they seem to be doing an awesome enough job that I'm just interested in seeing what they do anyway).

They aim for first launch at the end of 2025, so around the same time as Neutron.",34,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1ep33m5/manifest_space_interview_with_andy_lapsa_stoke/

First time RKLB has ever reported a net increase in Current Assets,"I'm sure a good amount of you caught this, but in all the excitement around record revenue/growth, the successful hot fire, the neutron infrastructure updates, etc, I missed something.

As far as I'm aware Rocket lab has never posted a quarterly net increase in total current assets **(obviously not counting the capital raise in February).**

Except they did last quarter. This really surprised me, I expected to see a similar quarter over quarter decrease typical to any quarter since the SPAC merger.

Total current assets as well as cash & equivalents + marketable securities combined are slightly higher this quarter than last.

Is this the start of a trend? I'm skeptical for now. CFO Adam Spice mentioned an increase in capex through the next 3-4 quarters tapering off in Q2 '25 as the first neutron launch approaches. That mixed with the lower expected launch revenue in Q3, I wouldn't be too surprised to see the downtrend resume, at least in the near term.

I still found this encouraging and thought it was worth a share.

"From Their Sub, 5 Months Ago","I am NOT recommending ASTS (no bad blood, just not interested in any space stock other than RKLB), but read this post from 5 months ago, when the stock was $3. Do you see the similarities between this and the bulls on this sub? 

My point is not that we will 6x from here, nor that we are guaranteed to succeed. I am also not dismissing the fact that most hyper-growth companies that failed had investors saying such things. 

However, in all the FOMO we keep experiencing, I just want everyone to remember that ASTS bulls suffered for years before seeing these monstrous gains. Yet, even in the steady bleeding, they maintained the thesis and profited greatly.

My point is this: if you find yourself genuinely convinced that the market will, as with ASTS, “not only price in current potential, but also expected future potential,” then do not lose heart. ",21,17,https://i.redd.it/lofaao1x7jgd1.jpeg

Possible hot fire at NASA Stennis - analysis with NASA firms data.,"Firms (=Fire Information Resource Management System) uses satellites to determine potential wild fire locations. They do that by detecting abnormal heat signatures. It is near real time - about 3 hours delayed.

And the location of a fire at Stennis could not be more precise, it was right at the RocketLabs Stennis test stand. There was a fire detected on the 18th of July. Check out the link below.

The SPAC = bad argument...,"Some people argue that all SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) are bad or risky investments.  
  
While they have a point, they're missing the bigger picture. SPACs offer an easy way for companies to access public markets quickly and with less scrutiny. Naturally, this path attracts some questionable companies. However, what these critics overlook is that there are solid companies that have gone public via SPACs because it was a general trend, not because they are shady.

An interesting point to note is that the median return of the entire stock market is negative, with almost every sector, from healthcare to energy, following this trend (with the exception of finance, which has a neutral median return). Only a few stocks contribute to an overall positive average return. (Source: [https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/average-is-not-the-same-as-median](https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/average-is-not-the-same-as-median))

Therefore, SPACs failing or delivering negative returns isn't extraordinary; it's the norm.   
  
Most SPACs are in a worse position than when they went public, often having attempted and failed to launch their projects since their listing. 

However, this isn't the case with RocketLab.   
When RocketLab went public via a SPAC in August 2021, they had already launched 21 times in 4 years, had an annual revenue of $60 million, and their space systems side was just getting started. Now, they launch over 15 times per year, aim for over $400 million in annual revenue, secure constellation-level contracts and $0.5 billion satellite contracts, and we can see their Neutron hardware taking shape.

-> RocketLab is in a significantly better position than when they were listed. The share price does not show it, but the company got fundamentally better.

This is not financial advice, just a few thoughts I had when I saw a graphic about median stock returns.

"Implied Volatility (IV) Skew for RKLB, unified for three approaching option expiration dates: August 2, August 9, and August 16","**Implied Volatility (IV):** IV is a measure of the market's forecast of a likely movement in a security's price. It often rises in bearish markets and falls in bullish markets, as higher IV corresponds to higher expected risk or uncertainty.

**IV Skew:** This shows the difference in IV across different strike prices for option contracts. Different IVs for different strikes reflects the market's expectations of the likelihood of different outcomes.

This skew is showing that the market is *positioning* and *hedging* for a large potential move up OR down within the coming weeks.

To be clear, this is to be taken with a grain of salt, the option chain is just one of many data inputs that investors should consider. But for what its worth, alongside the IV skew, **open interest** and **put/call volume** on the option chain are also quite bullish.

How to accelerate Rocket Lab's growth,"Rocket Lab has correctly positioned itself as a vertically-integrated player in the rapidly growing New Space economy. From components to systems, spacecraft, constellations, and through to launch, on-orbit operations, and space-based application solutions, Rocket Lab has built up the capability to “do what it says it’s going to do.” More importantly, as it has built up these capabilities, it’s done so with a success rate that approaches 100%. Rocket Lab does not fail, or at least hasn’t failed so far. As Beck is heard to say in Wild Wild Space, ""I’m not built to build shit.”

Yet there are tradeoffs to be made between organic growth and growth gained through acquisitions. Yes, building up capabilities in-house at a place like Rocket Lab ensures that the results meet and often exceed immediate and long-term requirements. Whereas the challenges of an acquisition include cultural fit and other integration challenges as well as inevitable product evolution to meet internal requirements. The biggest expense of internal development is the opportunity cost. Though an acquisition costs actual cash, you’re buying a capability that’s closer to market already.

While Rocket Lab has **capabilities**, it has limited **capacity**. The New Space economy is growing so fast that Rocket Lab doesn’t have enough time to hire the number of top-flight team members needed to grow their business from the inside. But the company’s anemic market cap makes it nearly impossible to acquire top-flight technologies to keep up with requirements, opportunities, and capacity.

As I see it, there are 4 possible scenarios that will allow the company to optimize growth and fully realize its potential:

1. The market must respond to Rocket Lab’s potential to such an extent that the market cap grows by multiples.
2. An outside equity investor must be found to invest $1 billion or more to fund acquisitions, but diluting existing investors in the process.
3. Rocket Lab must merge or even be acquired by another company with compatible capabilities/capacity and access to significant capital.
4. Rocket Lab can continue to grow organically with the opportunities and challenges it currently faces.

The market may give greater recognition to Rocket Lab once Neutron reaches orbit. But the stated scale up of launch cadence is incremental, spanning several years before it can deploy a constellation like the Falcon 9 is doing for StarLink. Even with a 70% annual growth rate, it’ll take many years to reach the scale implied by Peter Beck’s vision.

What Are Wall Street Analysts Missing in Rocket Lab's Growth Story? Morgan Stanley's analyst Kristine Tan Liwag has a 100% failure record of predicting Rocket Lab's share price,"Today, I shall discuss issues beyond Rocket Lab's control. Morgan Stanley's Kristine Tan Liwag has announced a price target of $6 for RKLB. Covering RKLB since January 2021, she has consistently given price targets that have never materialized. In my opinion, she has once again failed to consider the impact of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on the RKLB's share price (SP) but this time the upside of decrease in the FOMC rates. Let's delve into details.

Below are her price targets that I was able to find (there are more, but I believe that I captured all her predictions with SP changes from her preceding reports), the RLKB's SP at the close on the preceding business day to see where she was coming from and RKLB's SP 1 year later.

||Kristine Tan Liwag's price targets|RKLB on the preceding day|RKLB 1 year later|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2022/01/12|$17|$10.86|$4.83|
|2022/05/18|$16|$5.66|$4.65|
|2022/08/16|$12|$6.02|$5.88|
|2022/11/11|$10|$5.31|$4.33|
|2023/01/16|$10|$4.97|$4.94|
|2023/03/07|$10|$4.43|$4.43|
|2023/08/09|$10|$6.66||
|2024/05/09|$8|$4.10||
|2024/07/15|$6|$5.65||

Not once was she able to predict the price target with any accuracy despite arguably giving best questions to the CEO and CFO on earning calls. She was always more than 50% off. **Prices predicted by this analyst never (not once(!)) materialized after she made her predictions.**

How is it possible that she seems to be unable to get her finger on RKLB's price action?

Let's take a look at her professional history: ""*Kristine Liwag is an executive director at Morgan Stanley. She is the Head of Aerospace & Defense Equity Research. Prior to joining Morgan Stanley in 2020, Liwag was at Bank of America Merrill Lynch for 12 years* *in Aerospace & Defense and covered Smid-Cap Suppliers and Aircraft Lessors. She ranked Runner Up in the 2022 Institutional Investor Survey in the Aerospace & Defense category. Liwag holds a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Georgetown University in Washington, DC.*""

According to the BrokerCheck Report her employment history started in July 2008 as a Merrill Lynch's research analyst and she took her first General Industry Exams (General Securities Representative Examination) and her States Securities Law Exams (Uniform Securities Agent State Law Examination) in August 2008.

Let's take another step back and see what has happened before she started her analyst career. Since July 2004 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was steadily hiking rates, peaking at 5.24% in July 2006. In August 2007, the FOMC started to cut rates. When Kristine Tan Liwag started her career at Merrill Lynch, rates were already decreased to 2%. During her entire career until the latest hiking cycle, which started in March 2022, she did not have an opportunity to rates above 2.42% (April 2019). In the current cycle, which started in March 2022, but which was announced as far as in late November or early December 2021, the FOMC has increased rates to 5.33%, more than the double of the last cycle's peak.

She is not the only analyst out there with limited experience with the FOMC rates above 5%. Some analysts adapted better to the current FOMC rates cycle, some fared worse. As far as RKLB is concerned, she seems to be in the latter group. In her reports until the 2nd half of 2023, she seemed to ignore the effect of increased FOMC rates on RKLB. In her most recent price target of $6, she seems to ignore the effect of the upcoming decrease of FOMC rates, which will lift the RKLB's SP.

What is your opinion?

Will RKLB's share price double this year? - Revisiting my post from 2024/04/29,"My old post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cfjtco/will_rklbs_share_price_double_this_year/) and I'll re-post its text below. RLKB closed that day at $3.80. Today, it closed at $5.33.

My thesis was that RKLB has doubled from lows each year since its SPAC IPO and that 2024 will be no different in this regard. I've bet on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil. - this holds true at the current valuation.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06). - this was true and we're now expecting much higher Q2 revenues (+30% QoQ) and another doubling of the backlog.
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars. - this still holds true, the demand for Electron was confirmed by the Synspective's order of 10 Electron launches and app. 7 HASTE launches between 2024 and 2025.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year. - Neutron will not launch this year but Kuiper satellites are still scheduled for the launch in the second half of this year.

My thesis is still intact. Even though it is too early to do the victory lap, RKLB is now mere 30% away from doubling since its all time lows and there are many catalysts on the horizon. For example, the upcoming Archie hot-fire test (I love that Archimedes' nickname), Ashlee Vance's Wild Wild Space documentary on HBO MAX, the common run up to the earnings report and, of course, the FOMC cutting the rates this year.

Let me know your opinion.

[My post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cfjtco/will_rklbs_share_price_double_this_year/) from 2024/04/29:

RKLB share price has a history of doubling from its low during the summer and then falling down to repeat the process next year. So far, it has happened every and each year since its listing on the stock market:

* **2021: $9.5 to $21.34 from 2021/08/27 to 2021/09/09**
* **2022: $3.53 to $7.15 from 2022/06/30 to 2022/08/12**
* **2023:** **$3.76 to $8.05 from 2023/05/09 to 2023/07/19**

The 2024 low has been reached on 2024/4/16 at $3.47. What has changed from previous years besides the company's increased performance is that **the reported short interest YTD has increased by 161% from 22m to 58m shorted shares**. This huge increase right before the summer may cause a bound of a violent volatility once the 2024 doubling commences.

RKLB trades so cheaply and it is so heavily shorted that all that may be needed to revalue its stock is a shift in sentiment. Right now the stock is pricing in the most bearish of bearish outcomes. Delayed Neutron development, increased R&D costs and Electron's obsolescence. But Rocket Lab is the only space company dedicated to being a one stop shop for space applications. Suppose over this year, the management can craft a narrative that Neutron is really coming this year/early next year and with it a significant decrease in R&D costs and the growth and capture of launch and space system markets. Such sentiment shift may take time but I don't know, there are so many unusual factors with Rocket Lab that I could see it happening rapidly.

I am not betting that Rocket Lab is going to stage the most epic growth of all time. I am just betting on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06).
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year.

"Observation on Content Creators, especially Vince","First off, I want to acknowledge how much I appreciate the constant flow of content by our bigger RKLB Creators. I'm talking Dave G, Vince, Matt Money, ScottO.

I've noticed too that almost all of them are hungry for more shares. As time has gone on and we have traded down in this range, all of their collective research has only lead to them wanting more shares, even surpassing previous share count goals/targets. This has me extremely bullish that Creators doing a large amount of research haven't lost any hope.

With that being said, I want to give a shout out to Vince and also offer an apology. I used to be very critical of Vince, doubting his knowledge on the subject. It felt like he more yolo'ed into the stock and was being a permabull. Whether or not that was originally true or just my incorrect opinion, I think Vince has really grown his knowledge on RKLB. The sheer number of videos he puts put forces him to listen to, read, and gather information for us. I feel like the last few videos he has produced lately have also demonstrated that.

I was wondering what everyone else's opinions on our Creators are, since those are the faces of our community as we hope to grow in the years to come.",34,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1dw9a0h/observation_on_content_creators_especially_vince/
SDA Gamma Satellite Awards,"Important event upcoming for Rocket Lab. The SDA is expected to announce the winners of the Tranche 2 Transportation Layer Gamma satellites by August 8. Credit to Tim on twitter for pointing this out. https://x.com/Tim_X94/status/1808787582022467769

August 8 is also RKLB earnings call date, but I wouldn’t read too much into that. The Aug 8th date on the SDA contract was last updated in March.

The big $515m contract that RL won early this year was for 18 T2TL Beta satellites. I believe this was the smallest of the Beta satellite awards.

The Alpha satellites were awarded to York Space and Northrop Grumman. I don’t think RKLB was in a position to compete for these at the time.

The Beta satellites were originally awarded to Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. The Rocket Lab award was added on later.

There are only 20 Gamma satellites, and SDA apparently plans to award them to just one company. I doubt they would go with a new company, since the Gamma sats are apparently similar to Alpha and especially Beta satellites. So no real speculation here, other than that Rocket Lab for sure competed for these, and is one of 4 options SDA would likely choose. We should find out in the next month of they won.",44,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1dw08f0/sda_gamma_satellite_awards/

Rocket Lab Movie Review,"To get to what you want to hear, the movie is available on HBO MAX on July 17th.

Overall the movie is great, but not a “rocket lab” movie. It mostly covers Astra and honestly pulls no punches when talking about their failures. It also covers Planet a good bit. After Astra’s failures it cuts back to Rocket Lab doing their thing.
Both Kemp (pictured after the movie, definitely embarrassed) and the Planet Labs CEO were both in attendance and had two rows of reserved seats for people. There were 3 Rocket Lab employees there who bought their own seats (I think this speaks volumes in a good way). Firefly wasn’t put into the movie.

I loved the movie and I think you all will too. When watching please think about how much Kemp was cringing during the movie, it was great to watch!",94,33,https://i.redd.it/agdkqqjkru6d1.jpeg

Why I'm Holding till 2030 at least. My RKLB DD post.,"# Introduction

I’ve been following Rocket Lab since 2019, before it SPAC-ed in 2021. Having already known the company, I aped in following the SPAC announcement in the range of $12-$15. Slowly averaged down the cost through the SPAC-pocalypse. Average price probably in the range of $8-$10 not $4.78 as I changed brokers.

[Current position \~168,000 shares. \(\~140,000 shares are mine, the rest are held for family\) Have only trimmed \~10&#37; of shares in the recent run up as part of risk management, portfolio was 100&#37; in RKLB.](https://preview.redd.it/vn1prfwdko3e1.jpg?width=1093&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af5f6ad220bd27de3e600e6edb768f1ac71a63ae)

With the increase in stock price over the last few months and the increase in newcomers asking price target questions and new posts every time it hits a new round number, people asking if they should take profit as they expect a pull back to happen, there hasn’t been a proper DD post in awhile and I feel that many are not capturing the point that Sir Peter Beck's end goal for Rocket Lab is to be an **END-TO-END Space Company.** In my opinion it will be impossible to attribute a price target for $RKLB just simply because the industry is still in its infancy stage, instead, what is important is to see just how much of the growing space industry Rocket Lab could possibly capture in the next 5-10 years.

This is my own DD post and is not financial advise, I will attempt to cover and break down Rocket Labs business segments and why I will hold be a shareholder till 2030 and beyond.

[Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, spacecraft, satellite components, and on-orbit management - 2024 Q3 Earnings Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/xjvg1d975p3e1.jpg?width=1257&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fd1ccef8c9bea2cbd8d74e37fac398b64680181)

Although in the name, Rocket Lab is not just a launch provider, but an end-to-end space company providing, not just the launch service but also complete spacecraft design, manufacturing, satellite components and on-orbit management. Eventually, the company intends to use the experience to deliver and provide their own service from space through its own **satellite constellation**.

# Business Segments

**1. Electron**

[Electron is the only reusable orbital-class small rocket. Capturing and reflying Electron’s first stage enables higher launch frequency without expanding production and lowers launch costs.](https://preview.redd.it/okycitpk5p3e1.png?width=1345&format=png&auto=webp&s=453be91a7aad8274d7fef195c42eeb1daf48add2)

Electron is a two-stage, small-lift launch vehicle that is able to carry around 300kg to Low-Earth Orbit. Its Rutherford engines are the first electric-pump-fed engine to power an orbital-class rocket. Electron is often flown with a kick stage or Rocket Lab's Photon spacecraft. 

Proven Reliability – Electron has already flown 14 times this year, achieving record cadence, over the 10 times flown in 2023. Electron is now the 3rd most frequently launched rocket globally in 2024. 54 launches (50 successes, four failures \~ 92.5% success rate)

Responsiveness – Electron can launch from three launch pads across two hemispheres, from LC1 A/B in New Zealand, Rocket Lab’s privately owned launch pad or from LC2 in Wallops, Virginia. This has been demonstrated recently with a HASTE launch in LC2 and an electron launch within 24 hours on Nov 24/25.

[🚀 Literally to the Moon - Electron's Capstone Mission](https://preview.redd.it/hq5mcset5p3e1.png?width=1786&format=png&auto=webp&s=dee6c94313ff18c3c7a9c27bc28a84338d2094ac)

Small but powerful – On June 28, 2022, Rocket Lab launched a CubeSat to the Moon - a pathfinding mission to support NASA’s Artemis program which will land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon.

**Electron’s existential crisis, or not?** – While Electron has limitations in terms of carry capacity of 300 kg to LEO and the threat of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 Transporter Rideshare missions, Electron’s reliability and responsiveness together with its tailor-made missions have continued providing strength in demand evident from the signing of multi-launch agreements with its customers (Synspective, Capella Space, Blacksky etc.) Many discuss the threat of Electron being replaced by larger rockets, such as SpaceX’s Transporter rideshares or even Neutron cannibalising Electron in the future. However, just like taking an Uber directly to your destination or the bus somewhere near but not quite your destination, Electron together with its kick stage provides unrivaled accuracy, hitting target orbits with pinpoint accuracy.

**Why Capella Space chose Electron over Rideshare** 

“Instead of burning propellant to raise altitude, it’s far easier to simply be dropped off at a higher orbit by the launch vehicle. Being able to go higher than available rideshare missions was a major factor in Capella’s decision to pull Capella-9 from its planned launch and procure a dedicated ride from Rocket Lab for Capella-9 and Capella-10, which were launched in March 2023 on an Electron rocket to a targeted 600 km. This was also a major motivation behind the follow-on contract for four dedicated launches on Electron rockets for Acadia-generation satellites, the first of which launched to a targeted 640 km in August 2023”

[Continued Strong Demand for Electron](https://preview.redd.it/9hfpllwg6p3e1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=89128d9ce6e6660cdcb992ff6f3fdf0609146069)

The demand for Electron is also seen to be strong with the Average Selling Price increasing to what was $7.5 million to now $8.4 million. Furthermore, many of Electron’s direct competitors, mostly small launch ‘aspirational’ space companies have now been eliminated from the market. 

[ Astra Space Rocket 3 \(Dead\), Virgin Orbit LauncherOne \(Dead\), ABL Space RS1\(Dead\), Relativity Terran 1 \(Dead\), Firefly Alpha \(Dead Soon?\) ](https://preview.redd.it/57p1sfxr6p3e1.png?width=1795&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7b46dc23f26f9abd7236e9fd03fdbffc8789f8f)

It is NOT Rocket Science. Can’t really say that in this industry. Entrants to the small launch space have not fared well, many attribute it to a lack of demand as some pivot to larger launchers but in truth it seems that Electron has cemented its place as THE small launch provider.

**2. Haste**

https://preview.redd.it/v3l86x177p3e1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=30266164d98e447732f8e430c99bb58d3a4b887c

HASTE is a suborbital testbed launch vehicle derived from Rocket Lab’s heritage Electron rocket. HASTE provides reliable, high-cadence flight test opportunities needed to advance hypersonic and suborbital system technology development. Hypersonic speed is at least five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5 and above

[Types of Adaptions of Electron payload for HASTE vs Space-Based Orbital Electron](https://preview.redd.it/x7qeoojz7p3e1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b1fcbe1a09d5f8d9e6e7f8299e281d99bf53245)

From air-breathing and glide payloads to ballistic and future technologies, HASTE is a cost-effective and responsive hypersonic testbed that enables precision payload delivery for every mission.

[Leidos was awarded $334M air-breathing hypersonic system contract](https://preview.redd.it/rzpb8vfp8p3e1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=4995acc3b4ce982c65204c7969cc708a73981ec1)

Rocket Lab has had two HASTE missions so far, with the first HASTE mission on 17 June 2023 for Leidos. Leidos was awarded [$334M air-breathing hypersonic contract](https://www.leidos.com/insights/leidos-awarded-334m-air-breathing-hypersonic-system-contract) in 2022.

Russia has already demonstrated its use of the Khinzal hypersonic missile in Ukraine and the Pentagon’s warning to the congress that China already possesses the world’s leading hypersonic arsenal, the United States still does not possess its own arsenal of hypersonic missiles. As the US plays catch up, Rocket Lab stands to win, with at least another 3 HASTE missions for Leidos for 2024/2025  as part of the MACH-TB (Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed program.

Instead of highlighting how large the Total Addressable Market hypersonics could be, it would be more useful to highlight the innovation of Rocket Lab and also management’s ability to understand its technologies to adapt and create new use cases.

**3. Space Systems**

[We Don't Just Build Rockets in this Lab](https://preview.redd.it/03v1c2fk9p3e1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=27f2b92571ecd7eb36c692bb14caf370aa86db7b)

While rockets are really nice to look at, it is important to understand that launch business makes up only 20-30% of revenue of Rocket Lab, with Space Systems making up the majority of revenue contribution. Rocket Lab’s expansion into Space Systems through in-house capabilities or through acquisition is what seems to be most under-rated by investors/analysts.

**THIS IS WHERE I AM REALLY BULLISH. RECURRING REVENUE. MORE STUFF IN SPACE = MORE RECURRING REVENUE**

Starlink satellites have a lifespan of about five years. After which it will re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere and be destroyed. Satellites need replenishing, and companies are heading towards mega constellations to provide their services, Rocket Lab will either manufacture, provide components, flight software or even deploy them with Neutron. With the space economy projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030, and $1.8 trillion by 2035. Rocket Lab’s position as an end-to-end space company seems like a no-brainer as long as the company is able to capture a portion and with more than 1,700 satellites launched to orbit with Rocket Lab technology already, it seems to be on the right path. Some highlights of Rocket Lab’s space systems.

**a. Reaction Wheels**

[Love that we now ship pallets of reaction wheels to constellation customers. - Peter Beck](https://preview.redd.it/fofd4136bp3e1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=26d87d2a06b834269b21f22762292abb2dd2e37a)

A satellite typically needs at least three reaction wheels to control its movement along the X, Y, and Z axes. However, satellites often have four reaction wheels for redundancy

Deal already signed with a [single confidential mega constellation customer ](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/24/rocket-lab-reveals-big-supplier-deal-with-mystery-mega-constellation-customer/#:~:text=In%20its%20data%20sheet%20on,the%20base%20price%20at%20%24100%2C000)for thousands of reaction wheels per year. If you’re wondering who it could be… [Amazzz](https://www.youtube.com/live/wmmNuU8-Tr8?si=xpO2MeoKJ2KyHw5F&t=1218)

Amazon’s Kuiper constellation will have an initial 3,236 satellites Which likely will need replenishing every five years as well. That’s a good stream of recurring revenue for reaction wheels alone.

[\~4,000 to 5,000 satellites launched annually in 2030 - McKinsey](https://preview.redd.it/lmb1i4tmcp3e1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e5378628bdb2ce794333f878b8f54c530979638)

McKinsey anticipates in the base case, 27,000 active satellites in orbit by the end of 2030, almost a four-fold increase from today. To maintain that number at the assumed lifespan, there would need to be 4,000 to 5,000 satellites launched per year. In the high-demand scenario, in which nearly all proposed constellations materialize, McKinsey would expect to see more than 65,000 satellites, including many heavier ones, on orbit by 2030.

**b. Space Grade Solar**

[In 2022, Rocket Lab acquired leading satellite solar power producer SolAero Technologies. ](https://preview.redd.it/boenu4xrdp3e1.png?width=921&format=png&auto=webp&s=35bc3927f9baa504c4f498ec3ffddf844c274cd2)

Satellites need power. With the acquisition of Sol Aero, Rocket Lab is now one of the few space grade solar providers. Already there are more than 1,100 satellites in space powered by Rocket Lab solar products. The company has also been [awarded $23.9million](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-11-25/us-finalizes-awards-to-bae-systems-rocket-lab-for-semiconductor-chips) to boost the company’s production of solar cells by 50% over the next three years.

**c. Separation Systems**

[No separation anxiety - Example of Rocket Lab’s Separation System](https://preview.redd.it/i8s75ussep3e1.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a75dda0512efd875bab92e6f01da9ca86fee5d96)

In 2021 Rocket Lab acquired Planetary Systems Corporation which has designed, built, and delivered separation systems for more than 20 years with a 100% success rate - no product has ever failed to operate in flight. With the scale and resources of Rocket Lab behind the team, we are now making separation systems available globally at scale.

**d. Space Software**

[In October 2021, Rocket Lab acquired Advanced Solutions, Inc \(ASI\), a Colorado-based aerospace engineering firm delivering mission proven space software, mission simulation, and testing solutions.](https://preview.redd.it/quczg7jyep3e1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=98c4593cdd1a44f7e5e3377c5ea0b8be3c21a571)

As part of the end-to-end service, Rocket Lab also provides software and operation for customer satellites.

The vertically integrated and end-to-end space service Rocket Lab provides will allow customers who are looking to provide a service from space do so without any knowledge of building and operating spacecrafts.

Right now companies like Varda are still space companies applying pharmaceutical and life science applications, and even have outsourced [Rocket Lab will to conduct in-space operations](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-completes-second-spacecraft-for-varda-space-industries-advancing-in-space-manufacturing/), reentry positioning maneuvers, and deorbiting to recover Varda’s capsule while they attempt to develop the own in-house solutions. However, Rocket Lab's end goal as THE end-to-end space provider, is for companies with no knowledge of building or operating spacecrafts contracting Rocket Lab for its services.

**4. Catalysts**  
Written so much and I have not even covered Neutron, Space Race, Possibility with Mars Sample Return, NSSL Neutron On-ramping, SDA Contracts, Human rated Neutron launches. I'll point over to [Dave G Investing's video](https://youtu.be/rt4_g87TxL8?si=PHAi9oegs_13u0AL) on the potential nearer term catalysts, I think he covers it in great detail.

[Dave G Investing - Potential Catalysts](https://preview.redd.it/xvnfaef9jp3e1.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=540f11194cebd49866ceb72b3b7a7e6e628b4a0c)

Further term growth opportunities include Neutron signing more commercial launches to deploy constellations or even taking on some contracts to help deploy Kuiper if any of their launch providers for their 83 launches fail to deliver. Also as SPB mentioned, Neutron’s success will then allow for Rocket Lab to develop its own constellation. These catalysts really show the uncapped potential of the company, which makes valuing the company today extremely difficult, which is why I will be holding my shares, at least a good amount of it till 2030.

**5. Conclusion**

[This guy doesn't build shit](https://preview.redd.it/wqzjk4zmjp3e1.png?width=1505&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5b3ab591beb4426ff8223a327fa6c41f8e14b44)

Trust in SPB. He knows Rockets. Watch Wild Wild Space on HBO for those who haven't.

Rocket engineer at heart, he developed Electron with less than $100 million compared to rockets like Virgin Orbit's LauncherOne estimated to be over $1 billion and still failed.

Space-X Tender offer of $350B…Good news for Rocket Lab and Space Industry,"No idea why my first post got deleted.  I didn’t see anything in it that was against the rules.  

If Rocket Lab is worth 10% of SpaceX as the #2 private provider then that is a market cap of $35B so $72 a share.  I wouldn’t be surprised if SpaceX was worth more on the public markets than for the private investors.  Look how much the market has driven up Tesla and Nvidia on future earnings that are several years away.  

My opinion is this is very bullish for Rocket Lab and investors.  The more money that goes into the space industry the more it will be spread around to the companies that can deliver.",373,80,https://i.redd.it/fxz0n4v8sj4e1.jpeg

Should You Buy $RKLB After the Big Run-Up? Here’s a Litmus Test,"Hey everyone,

I’ve noticed a lot of posts lately asking, “Should I buy $RKLB now after the huge price increase?” Here’s a litmus test to help guide your decision:

First, ask yourself: If you already owned the stock, would you sell it now? If the answer is no because you think the price will continue to rise, then why wouldn’t you buy more now? If you believe in the company’s long-term future, the recent run-up shouldn’t deter you.

Remember, investors are in it for the long haul. Traders are the ones making short-term moves. And if you’re asking a biased community for financial advice, it’s probably a sign that you’re not the best trader. Timing the market is notoriously difficult, and most people don’t get it right.

So instead of focusing on short-term fluctuations, ask yourself if Rocket Lab’s long-term vision aligns with your investment goals. Don’t try to time the market—make decisions based on your confidence in the company’s future.

As always, do your own research and assess your personal financial situation.

read Rocket Lab's MSR proposal.

Every. Single. Mission. that they have done and will do, is vitally important as heritage to Mars Sample Return. CAPSTONE moon navigation, Escapade Mars flight telemetry, Venus life finder. software to Firefly's moon lander. Varda capsule re-entry, Victus haze orbital rendezvous, and obviously Neutron. Every single damn one. They played the long game and this is why they won the research contract. Probably the reason stock is up 30% last week. If they finalize the contract their price is $2bn for sample return between 2031-33 against NASA's original budget and timeline of $10bn by 2040.

Powerful endorsement yesterday by Blackrock for both ASTS and RKLB,"i am pretty sure no one posted this on this sub, so here goes:

Tony Kim, Head of Technology Investing at BlackRock, discusses AST SpaceMobile and Rocket Lab at the Deutsche Bank Global Space Summit 2024.

“In the public market, I think there are two companies that are over $5B and they have been a recent resurgence, but it has been 20 years of hell. But there has been a recent resurgence of two companies that crossed $5B of market cap …. And the two are not posterchilds of profitability. What they are is that they represent leadership. The power log ?
In the case of one company regarding potentially unlocking direct communications and the other one , the alternative to SpaceX on launch. So those are the two. They’re not really profitable yet, but they have the market valuation. The rest, they are mired in small subset of valuations? So yes, profitability is of course important, but I think more important is, are you a viable business with scale. Are you one of the companies that will achieve scale. And with scale comes profitability.”

The Intangibles are important - and its looking better for Rocket Lab,"I kinda feel sorry for SpaceX lately.  They have done some fantastic engineering and I’m sure have a lot of great people but their CEO and 50% owner has become a huge distraction.  The new private space race is in its infancy so a good head start isn’t enough.  Maintaining superiority in an industry over decades is difficult.  Do you know how many auto manufactures didn’t make it?  If you want to see what negative publicity can do to a superior product, go read the story of Preston Tucker or watch the movie.  

If Musk had just kept the problem to X, it would probably be fine but now he is using Starlink to defy the Brazilian Government.  I know that their government involved Starlink first but instead of backing down he is doubling down.  This could have long term ramifications if worldwide governments think Musk has no respect for their laws and start to put laws in place to limit his power in their countries.  I can guarantee these discussions are happening.  

The other problem for SpaceX now is their CEO decided to bet on one horse instead of just remaining neutral.  If his horse loses, there is no way he will see support from a Harris/Walz administration.  Musk is posting pictures of Harris as a Russian General…such a dumb move if you really want government contracts. I’m sure there are people in SpaceX that have left or are thinking of leaving because they don’t want to work for Musk anymore.  Again….that will benefit Rocket lab and Blue Origin and maybe a few of the other startups looking to scale quickly.

Blue Origin and Rocket Lab are poised to take advantage of these missteps by Musk.  That is why you see nothing about the election from Bezos and Beck because they are much smarter and know that to overtake SpaceX at this point you just put your head down and do the work.  There isn’t any need to attack Musk…he is lighting himself on fire.",208,25,https://i.redd.it/y80va2ienlmd1.jpeg

Why I think RKLB is a hold ,"I'm seeing a lot of new people popping up in this sub talking about gainz for ants. Y'all shortsighted motherfuckers. Look at the macro picture: 

1. US/China space race heating up. China is seen as a ""pacing challenge"" by the US military. Last time this shit happened during the Cold War, NASA spending reached 4.5% of federal budget. 

2. NO to monopoly. National security shit is not allowed to have a monopoly. Spacex will never be the only player. And it's valued at 200 bil, almost 50x what rklb is worth.

3. The huge TAM of space services in general. Lunar exploration, mars, LEO sats, spy sats, LEO experimental medicine, low gravity manufacturing etc. A lot of it is speculative you say? Well that's what investing in tech is about aye? You're looking for the NEXT BIG THING, not the last big thing. You might as well do GEICO and Coca Cola if you're of that bent. 

4. Actual working rocket and workable path to another big ass rocket. How many other companies you know put their money where their mouth is and can execute to a high level. Shit, even bezos is fking up with blue origin. I have more confidence in someone who has actually made a rocket fly, than some shit that's still on the pad. 

5. A good underpromise over deliver CEO. Sir Beck doesn't shoot his mouth off. Wanna know what that means? It means if he's anything like Musk, share price would be a multiple of what it is with hype. And I'm all for execute first hype later. 

6. Improving macro environment. Last time we had a massive reduction in rates after 08, there's a boom for 10 years. 2011 to 2021 were some of the best times in the market. Now with lower rates, you bet your ass the rotation into small and mid caps is gonna happen. Not least because lower rates make capital raising and debt obligations a lot more manageable. 

7. In other words, I fking love the stock. Positions: 
16326 shares @ 4.04 and 69 Jan 2025 calls.

Any newbs out there that don’t know this, RocketLab last year had had to punt being on boarded because they no longer had a credible path to launch in 2024.

I think it’s pretty obvious right now that a path to launch in 2025 is extremely credible and in a years time they should be scoring some of these contracts.

These are yearly awards, so for shit and giggles let’s say Neutron scores half these launches.

4 launches at probably 70 to 80 million (DoD are extra juicy compared to a standard 55 million dollar launch.) That revenue is what RocketLab has made this entire year so far. 

I get distracted dreaming about MSR and the current stock price, but Neutron scaling is such a big deal. So much Cheddar.

An Observation ,"I’m sure we’re all excited about another monster trading session after a surreal run up.  I’m probably not the only one wondering each week if, and when, the eventual pull back is going to happen..  only to see the stock go higher.

I thought I’d share a quick story of an interaction earlier today to give some context to what many of us wrestle with.

I went to PT this morning, and we were shooting the breeze about life when she asked what I was up to.  We’re pretty good friends at this point, and the conversation drifted towards investing since it’s something I’m passionate about.  Naturally, Rocket Lab came up, and she was genuinely curious so I spent some time sharing the bullet points about the company, Peter Beck, the sector, etc.  The other two providers that were nearby joined in the conversation since they didn’t have clients at the time, and so I talked to them about it too.

What was absolutely fascinating to me was that none of them had ever heard of Rocket Lab.  These are intelligent, accomplished, capable medical professionals.  

People like to joke about you know it’s time to sell when you over hear Uber & Lyft drivers talking about a stock.  I think the opposite is true as well.  Anecdotally, outside of this sub, WSB, and X/twitter, there is practically no one in my professional or personal spheres that has heard of this company - unless I’ve personally told them about it.  

My point is..  the recent run up as been incredible, and while there is a very real possibility of a drawback in the near future, especially for some unforeseen news or black swan event, this company is still one of the best kept secrets.  

Of course I could be wrong, and there is a lot of risk ahead and plenty that could go badly..  However, I think this is still just the initial wave crashing upon the shoreline.  Once more people clue in, it’s going to be interesting.

I’d be very curious how many folks on this sub have had anyone tell them about RKLB, and not the other way around.

TLDR:  we are just getting started.

Rocket Lab confirms plan to bid for Pentagon launch contracts with new medium rocket,"Some late night DD for anyone interested.

>“We’re excited to bid this time round for NSSL Lane 1, and we think Neutron is a really good vehicle for it,” Rocket Lab’s founder and CEO Peter Beck told *SpaceNews*. 

Space Force is wanting the first launches to go up in December of 2025, which I think we should be able to achieve. [Here is the actual open contract for the On-Ramp Request for Proposals](https://sam.gov/opp/9bc05c3ce9f2492a969fc8fbca312858/view). Assuming we get at least a couple of these 30 missions, it will give Neutron some serious legitimacy. The SpaceForce has to approve these contracts based on whether an analysis of the companies concept of operations shows that the company can actually do it. Lots of confidence and momentum if we can get approved and snag a few.

Rocket Lab Owns 2/3 of the U.S. Launch Market -- That Isn't SpaceX,"https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/rocket-lab-owns-2-3-120000860.html

When Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB) reported second-quarter earnings last week, it ignited a multiday rally that sent its stock price soaring as much as 18%. And no wonder.

Sales at the small space rocket manufacturer soared 71% year over year, beating analyst forecasts. The per-share loss for the quarter was $0.08 -- not great -- but still better than the $0.10 loss that Wall Street forecast.

A historic quarter

In fact, Chief Executive Officer Peter Beck said Q2 was Rocket Lab's ""highest revenue quarter in company history"" -- no great surprise given that each succeeding quarter shows revenue growth. But Beck also said that Rocket Lab is seeing ""strong and growing demand for our launch services and space systems products,"" such as the Electron rocket, Photon kick stage spacecraft, and satellites built for the U.S. Space Force. The company is also making progress on new products to power profit in the future.

First and foremost among these are the new Neutron rocket, a medium-lift rocket that, in a unique twist on traditional design, encapsulates its second stage within a reusable first stage with an integrated (and also reusable) payload fairing.

In last week's press release, Rocket Lab highlighted the recent successful first hot fire test of the Archimedes engine, nine of which will be used to power Neutron's first stage. Four days later, Rocket Lab posted a ""how it started, how it's going"" photo comparison on X first showing CEO Beck standing next to a mockup of the then-just-announced Neutron concept vehicle, side by side with a completed half-fairing for a real-life Neutron rocket.

What's more, just one day earlier, Rocket Lab announced its 10th mission so far this year, the launch of a Capella Space satellite to orbit atop an Electron rocket. Crucially, this was the first launch for Capella since September 2023, when an anomaly in an Electron rocket's second stage resulted in a loss of the payload. The fact that Capella maintained its faith in Rocket Lab -- and that faith was vindicated with a successful launch over the weekend -- has to come as happy news for Rocket Lab shareholders.

SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and ULA -- in that order

So yes, it's been a busy few days for Rocket Lab, and jam-packed with good news. Now here's some less good news.

According to Beck, Rocket Lab's Electron has become ""the most frequently launched small rocket globally."" And so far this year, Rocket Lab is responsible for ""64% of all non-SpaceX orbital U.S. launches in 2024 to date."" That sounds impressive, but it comes with a big caveat. SpaceX orbital U.S. launches already number 79 (and probably more by the time this article publishes). Meanwhile, Rocket Lab's 64% amounts to only 10 launches total.

That actually gives you a better idea of the distance between No. 2 rocket launcher Rocket Lab and No. 3 United Launch Alliance (ULA has launched four times this year, making up about 28% of non-SpaceX orbital U.S. launches), than of how close Rocket Lab is to overtaking SpaceX.

Hint: It's not even close. For the foreseeable future, the great American space race is going to remain with SpaceX as No. 1, then a big gap with everybody else.

The race for No. 2

Investors also need to be aware that Rocket Lab faces some serious competition even in the race to remain No. 2 to SpaceX.

Don't get me wrong. Rocket Lab is accelerating its launch cadence. Its revenue is accelerating. And there's a very real chance Rocket Lab will turn profitable in the next year or two. Still, now that United Launch Alliance has its new Vulcan rocket operational, it's moving quickly to regain its traditional role as one of America's leading launch companies. As I pointed out earlier this month, ULA currently has 23 Vulcan rockets in various stages of construction, and ULA CEO Tory Bruno is promising investors he will launch 20 times next year, and 25 times in 2026.

With 10 launches under its belt already in 2024, and more on the way, Rocket Lab could still out-launch ULA, and remain America's No. 2 launch provider in the future. But ULA is definitely going to try and give Rocket Lab a run for its money.",154,13,https://i.redd.it/h1c1fwpaemkd1.jpeg
Rocket Lab RKLB leaked presentation at the University of Michigan reveals company is targeting June 2025 for Neutron Rocket.,"
At last week's Rocket Lab presentation at the University of Michigan, Richard French, VP of Business Development, shared that the internal target launch date for the Neutron rocket is set for June 2025.

That puts us potentially just 9 months away from Neutron's maiden flight! 

With a full-duration Archimedes engine firing still ahead, it appears much of the major risk in Neutron's development is behind us.

The other interesting thing is as the price has increased, the shorts have increased by 2M shares and the Short interest ratio has doubled in the last month.

Apparently SpaceX is afraid of competition…Rocket Lab has a great opportunity here.,"I’m pretty excited about the advancements in rockets that SpaceX has created.  I have Starlink and it works well.  SpaceX has been so far out in front that one would think they wouldn’t be afraid of competition but they clearly are.  This is an actual filing by SpaceX.  It is clear that their CEO thinks they should be the only game in town.  Why would he care what ASTS stock has done when TSLA stock was one of the best from 2010-2020?  He basically burned $34B buying Twitter  which is over 6X the market cap of Rocket Lab or ASTS.  He could have probably tried to buy both by way overpaying and he still would have done better than buying Twitter.  For some people it is never enough I guess to win…it’s about trying to make sure others lose.  

If Rocket Lab keeps going up the way that it has I would expect it to be targeted as well with this kind of nonsense.  Stay strong….there are big opportunities ahead for Rocket Lab.  ",149,76,https://i.redd.it/r40dpj72cjsd1.jpeg

-“if we get to 2 launches per month that the sweet spot for electron, where we’re really get north of that 40% gross margin “

-“ I think we can get there (50% gross margin) without reusablity, before I had my doubts, but if we’re doing 30 launches a year I think we can pretty safely get their without reuseable “

RKLB MSR odds increased due to Elon’s recent actions. ,"I firmly believe that all of Elons recent shenanigans (getting very political very quickly, paying for votes, claims he’s talking to Putin, etc.) are only going to help RKLB. NASA administrator Nelson believes that these claims about Elon should be investigated and I believe there’s a growing anti-monopoly mindset around SpaceX right now in this industry. 

Therefore, I think that NASA is more likely to choose RKLB over SpaceX for MSR due to wanting to help get other launch providers up to a near-SpaceX level quicker. 

But they won’t just do this out of kindness, I also cannot see any other realistic candidate with RKLBs interplanetary track record. The only other real competitor (other than SpaceX) is BO and they just don’t have the resume for this. Unless their application was joint with many other organizations, I just don’t see them getting MSR. 

We should be thanking Elon for his stupidity. 

Fingers crossed we get this…

Advice to small investors on RKLB - Stay away from buying options for a while.,"This is an advice to small investors who are entering the market from an experienced investor who did lose money playing options.

Options are very tempting at the moment given the run RKLB had this quarter. Every stock will have pullback. When it does, time value eat away potential profits.

Your best bet through earnings is to buy the stock and sell out of the money covered calls for November end. The money you make from the covered calls, you can put it back into RKLB to increase your share count. Don't despair if your options are called. Do it again.

Consider buying options when RSI goes below 40 and MACDs are in negative territory. This is where technical analysis will help you.

Past 2 days have been the most turbulent I've seen since August,"I've never seen RKLB this turbulent since August, and that's considering we had a few pullbacks. Turbulent in the sense of not just the dips but the still high-ish buying and selling demand.

Is it an American thing to be taking profits at the start of December for tax planning? Seeing this being done with a heap of counters related to WSB and penny stocks as well (e.g. WOLF, RCAT, BKSY, ACHR, JOBY, etc etc) and usually price levels are pretty well defended with RKLB, but seeing otherwise these past 2 days.

Betting my whole portfolio on RKLB,"Before anyone losses their mind about going all in on one stock, I own my own business and have a 401k. I am not relying on this at all for my day to day living. I am 36 and have 3 kids. Still drive the same truck and live in the same house. 

I put 350k ""borrowed half of that"" during covid on oil ""SM energy"" and turned it to 1.5m. As you can see I am maxed out on margin and keep an eye on it every day. I am definitely not a millionaire and am making the largest gamble of my life by reinvesting my whole portfolio into one stock. 

Due to volatility and RL being a small cap, TD will only lend 1/3 of my equity. I have to leverage a less volitaile stock to be able to have more margin. I was doing that with OXY before but didn't want to book the losses on BABA yet, so I sold OXY.  I'm still getting my ass kicked on BABA but hoping it has bottomed. 

Whatever gains from BABA ""passed my margin balance"", will be used to buy more RKLB. 

Yes, this is risky as hell, but I truly believe Rocket Lab at these levels is the opportunity of a lifetime. 

The biggest risk I see to RL is not actually Space X IMO. I believe it's Relativity Space and Firefly. FF because it will challenge Electron and Nuetron with their small and medium payload. Then Relativity because of their price point per kilogram with Terran R. We have all seen what happened to Virgin Orbit and ASTRA, but FF and RS seem to have unlimited funding for now. 

That all being said, competition is healthy and demand will only grow. The one thing that puts me at ease, is that RL is investing it such more than just luanch. Their recent Photon Launch on Falcon 9 ""which they netted more on than Space X"", shows one example of that when Peter Beck said, ""eventually I want everything in space to have a Rocket Lab Logo"" he meant it. 

Space Systems is currently bringing in more revenue than launch, and the TAM for Space is currently 10x that of launch.

RL is so much more than just a launch company. Happy to make the biggest bet of my life on a company that seems determined to be leader in the Space Industry! 

Can we please meet up for the Nuetron Launch?

I will post with you guys whether I get my ass kicked or this pays off for all of us. 

Good luck Labbers!!",111,52,https://i.redd.it/0j70m04qzz7b1.jpg

Simple DD for Newcomers.,"RKLB builds satellites and rockets currently it has operational Electron small launch rocket with over 50 launches. They are working on a big rocket called Neutron which will be Reusable. As well as a suite of various satellites.

What is a reusable rocket and why is it important?

Most rockets ever to exist have been expendable, meaning they get destroyed or become museum peices. Imagine the cost of an airplane ticket if you had to build a 747 airplane fly across the world and trash the 747 every time. That's basically what humanity did until SpaceX proved it was possible to land rockets with Falcon 9. The concept has been proven. Rocket Lab along with a few others are chasing this dream. Since SpaceX landed Falcon 9 and became reusable no one has been able to duplicate this and the company is now worth 210 billion market cap, they are in first place a huge leap ahead of everyone.

Furthermore, Rocket Lab builds the satellites for many of the launches, satellite components and has a huge space systems division and sells a service, which means they scoop up way more profit margin. They are far ahead all others (excluding SpaceX) and plan to launch the first Neutron mid 2025 and will become profitable shortly after. 

Neutron will be designed to be reusable from day 1 where Falcon 9 was not which will give them a big advantage in design. 

RKLB is only valued around 3.2 billion to SpaceXs 210 billion. Pennies on the dollar and most agree it is wildly undervalued right now. 

So, proof of concept has been established by SpaceX, Rocket Lab has tons of space and launch experience with their Electron Rocket being the second most frequently launched rocket. They have hundreds of millions in cash reserves to finish the development, the Archimedes engine that powers Neutron has just fired up for the first time recently after 3 yesrs of hard work and engines are the longest lead time in building a rocket. No other company is in a more perfect position to become and remain the #2 space company in the world. Once Neutron is successful and launching, this company should easily be worth 20-50 billion dollars ($45-$100 stock price) fair value still a fraction of SpaceX, they will be able to launch their own mega satellite constellations.

The CEO and Founder Peter Beck is an absolute genius, self taught rocket scientist and has been regarded as such by many influential people in the industry.

The meme potential is fun and could be nice, the fundamental potential... the sky is the limit.

"A Rocket Lab Due Diligence (DD), it is time we discuss this company seriously.","# Rocket Lab Due-Diligence (DD)

‘We Open Access to Space to Improve Life on Earth.’

# Introduction

With the 2024 first launch of the Rocket Lab Mega Constellation Launcher—The Neutron—fast approaching, I decided it is high time for a more up-to-date DD on Rocket Lab. A lot is happening in the industry, the company, and the world. I have decided to dive into the future, fundamentals, industry, funding, financials, dreams, and of course, the memes of the aspiring space company. Now, I am posting my DD into both of the Rocket Lab subreddit, as I am new to writing DD and I want to hit as wide of an audience as I can. One disclaimer (for those who do not like stock talk), this DD is not meant to encourage buying of the stock, nor is it financial advice or a stock-only DD, I merely want to dive into this company and simply spark some discussion on it!

Now, Rocket Lab is a private aerospace manufacturer and small satellite launch service provider. The company was founded in 2006 by Peter Beck and is headquartered in Long Beach, California, with additional facilities in New Zealand and Australia. Rocket Lab specializes in the development and launch of small rockets capable of delivering payloads of up to 300 kilograms to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab—self-designated as a leader in launch and space systems—is a company that has a chance at becoming a highly profitable giant over the next decade and beyond. In my honest opinion, Rocket Lab currently thrives off of the crumbs of the current space industry ecosystem. With Space X increasingly focused upon one goal—thanks to their controversial, yet nevertheless, fearless leader—being Mars, Rocket Labs can (and in my opinion will) become one of the go-to space companies for low earth orbit launches in the near term and in the long-term become one of the go-to space company for launches between the Moon, Venus, and Mars as well. Rocket Lab currently lives off of the crumbs left behind by NASA, Space X, and the United States military-industrial complex.

[Like these two legends from the movie War Dogs, Rocket Lab is determined to become the go-to space company for transporting all types of goods into orbit. For those of you who have not seen the movie \(I personally highly recommend it\), essentially, when these two start their arms-dealing company, they focus upon all of the small contracts that the government is putting out for arms supplies. The contracts that the big players are ignoring, due to their small sizes, even so, these small contracts are worth hundreds of thousands to low millions. Now, this is where Rocket Lab currently lies in the industry.](https://preview.redd.it/ang8zdp4pd4b1.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=22e61dcd7a2bd3aed7dae5bbe0b5776ec955c7ba)

[\\""A new space race has begun, and most Americans are not even aware of it. This race is not \[about\] political prestige or military power. This new race involves the whole human species in a contest against time.\\"" - Ben Bova](https://preview.redd.it/9mmd18f6pd4b1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=afd7ab06311acea60bae95af0dec2b4b1e98b3e5)

Now, before I dive into everything here, I need every to understand that this industry is on the verge of immense change and rapid evolution. We are currently in the first stage of the world’s Second Space Race. As a student of History, I can confidently tell you that there are murmurings within the historical community, that this is the case, beginning with the creation and success of Space X’s first reusable rocket: the Falcon 9. On December 21st of 2015, when the first Falcon 9 was launched and the landing was successful with the first stage fully recovered, the race began. In the same way that there is no single company above all others in the airline, shipping & transportation, or car manufacturing industries, is the same reason I do not believe that Space X will alone run the space industry’s transportation needs. There is plenty of room for companies like Rocket Lab to fill the gaps Space X cannot and in a decade’s time, there will be plenty of room for even more companies. Yet, there are no companies that are even close to competing with Space X—other than Rocket Lab—at this time. Now, I won’t go deeply into most of these competitors in this deep dive, but to be short, Astra is on the verge of total failure, Virgin Galactic has been playing an entirely different game—space tourism, which there is a massive market for, just perhaps won’t be penetrated by them—they likewise seem to be failing. While Blue Origin has been playing a strong game and Space X an even stronger one, albeit more and more focused solely on Mars as the years go on.

[  Here you can see the 1-year charts of Rocket Lab, Astra, Virgin, and Boeing for reference, as you can see, these charts speak volumes. Rocket Lab has been having a tough year but has found a nice bottom and is consistently bouncing from lows in the $3.6-4 range. While Astra has been reduced to a penny stock, with their future unknown. Virgin Galactic is only maintaining below Rocket Lab’s share price, partly due to the large number of Retail investors that do not know much and refuse to let it die, coupled with a small hope that the company can recover in the coming years. Boeing is here for reference as to what a successful, large-cap company involved in a similar industry \(and the space industry as well\), should look like over the course of a decent year.](https://preview.redd.it/r63hheb9pd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=10f9df21a4c592bf9fa5d07927d7df1217a4707c)

*Now, there are a few assumptions that I am making that we need to cover before diving into the real DD:* Whether it be because we live in the beginnings of a second Space Race (fueled by privatized space companies and the world’s governments) or because of technological advancement and a rising interest in space, the increase in rocket launches, space development (in Earth’s orbit, the Moon, and Mars), and the lowering costs of space launches… it will become exponentially cheaper, easier, and faster to launch into orbit and the industry as a whole will have a massive boom—akin, in a way, to the industrial revolution—over the mid-to-late 2020s into the early 2030s. With the mid-to-end 2030s and early 2040s, we will see massive developments in terms of low-Earth orbit manufacturing facilities, tourist destinations, and stations, as well as settlements on the Moon for mining and refueling for greater exploration and colonization of the Sol System as a whole.

Now these are in part assumptions, but I think once one does the research and looks at the fact, all of this is very achievable. Even if it does not occur in this way, you can shift the dates by an additional decade and every time you do, the more likely, easier, and cheaper it all becomes.

Rocket Lab's business model revolves around providing cost-effective and frequent access to space for small satellite operators. The company aims to simplify the process of deploying satellites by offering dedicated launches on its Electron rocket. Rocket Lab operates as an end-to-end service provider, handling the entire launch process from mission planning and payload integration to launch and on-orbit operations.

# Section 1: Rocket Lab Takes Flight! The Electron & the Neutron

[  ‘Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, complete spacecraft design and manufacturing, satellite components, flight software, and on-orbit management.’ – Rocket Labs](https://preview.redd.it/kfcdll9dpd4b1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=e05df5ae09c39df476981844a7beded28082beda)

Rocket Lab's primary launch vehicle, the Electron, is a two-stage rocket powered by Rutherford engines, which use electric-pump-fed LOX/RP-1 propellants. The Electron is designed to optimize cost, flexibility, and rapid launch capability for small satellites. Rocket Lab has demonstrated numerous successful launches since its inaugural flight in 2017, showcasing its technological prowess and reliability. The small satellite market has been growing rapidly, driven by increased demand for data collection, communications, and Earth observation. Rocket Lab's focus on dedicated launches for small satellites positions it well to capture a significant portion of this expanding market. The company has already established a solid customer base, securing contracts with government agencies, research institutions, and commercial entities.

Rocket Labs—at the time of writing this—has had 37 launches—with a 91.89% success rate—deployed 164 satellites, operates 3 launch pads, and is maintaining 3 Photon Satellites in the Earth’s orbit. Of the 164 satellites launched by Rocket Labs, they were commissioned to do so by a wide variety of clients, from NASA, Space Force, DARPA, to Canon. Rocket Labs is supported by Future Fund: Australia’s Sovereign Wealth Fund, Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Data Collective, Greenspring Associates, ACC, Promus Ventures, L One W One Ltd., and Lockheed Martin.

Rocket Lab’s main rocket, the Electron—built and operated by Rocket Lab—has flown 37 times and been successful 34 times, with only 3 failures. Rocket Lab’s key areas of business penetration lie in the launch of mid-sized service rockets, the manufacturing of space systems and satellites, and their adept ability to manufacture industrial space parts, applications, and proponents. The latter of which, they are sort of unopposed in terms of competition.

The Neutron—Rocket Lab’s medium-lift, mega constellation launcher—will be able to launch 13,000 kilograms into low Earth orbit and it will be …drum roll please… reusable! The current goal is for it to launch in 2024. It will be designed for not only low earth orbital supply missions, but also deep space missions, and even human spaceflight. It will be fairing a design allowing for full reusability of the first stage and it will be lightweight, being made of Rock Lab’s own carbon composite structure. The home base for the Neutron will be at the Neutron Production Complex and the launch pad at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility and Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.

[  ‘The Neutron Production Complex will be home to a rocket production, assembly, and integration facility, as well as a dedicated launch pad for the Neutron rocket located on the southern end of Wallops Island. The estimated 250,000 square-foot state-of-the-art complex will be constructed on a 28-acre site adjacent to the Wallops Island Flight Facility and will include a Launch Control Center, Rocket Lab’s fifth global operations center for launch activities and on-orbit operations. To support rapid production of the Neutron rocket, current plans for the complex include automated fiber placement robotic production systems capable of laying up meters of Neutron’s new, specially formulated carbon composite structures in minutes. As a reusable rocket, Neutron is designed to land back on the Launch Complex 3 pad after a mission and from there it would be returned to the production complex for refurbishment and re-flight.’](https://preview.redd.it/cove17mgpd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d5058d8a8e4e79c9fbc63dfea4b0e5680d3a137)

With Space X dominating large-load space orbital flight and transportation, Rocket Labs, in my honest opinion, is where Space X was roughly something like 6-8 years ago. While Rocket Lab intends to compete with Space X—whether it will be considered competition in an industry this brand new and small, time will tell—for cargo and humans to the low Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and even Venus! Space X and Elon Musk have made it abundantly clear that the goal of Space X is the large-scale settlement of Mars. While later models of Rocket Lab’s Neutron will be able to go to Mars and Venus, it appears that is not their main goal. In the near term (being the next two decades), they will be looking to dominate the low Earth orbit and Moon market as well as the manufacturing of industrial space parts, applications, and proponents.

# Section 2: The Space Industry & Company Fundamentals

Rocket Lab faces competition from other commercial launch providers, such as SpaceX, and Blue Origin. However, the company differentiates itself by specializing in small satellite launches, offering a tailored solution for this niche market. Rocket Lab's Electron rocket provides the advantage of dedicated launches and the flexibility to reach specific orbits, making it an attractive option for small satellite operators.

Rocket Lab has raised significant funding through various investment rounds, securing capital from venture capital firms, strategic partners, and government entities. Notable investors include Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Lockheed Martin. The company's ability to attract substantial investment indicates confidence in its business model and growth potential. Rocket Lab operates within the regulatory framework of the countries in which it launches its rockets. The company holds necessary licenses and approvals from government agencies, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Compliance with safety regulations and adherence to environmental guidelines are crucial aspects of Rocket Lab's operations.

Despite its achievements, Rocket Lab faces several risks and challenges. The space industry is highly competitive, and the success of the company depends on its ability to secure launch contracts and maintain a steady launch cadence. Regulatory changes, launch failures, or delays could impact Rocket Lab's operations and reputation. Additionally, the emergence of new technologies or market disruptors could pose a threat to the company's market position

Now, let’s talk about the elephant in the room, the Quarterly Results. To preface, negative quarterly results mean—pardon my French—jack-shit (at least in the short term) for a company such as Rocket Lab, that is looking at penetrating a market such as the space industry. We are going to look at the past four Quarterly Results in chronological order.

**Q2 2022 Report:** Rocket Lab achieved record revenue of $55.5 million, showing significant growth compared to the previous quarter (36% sequential growth) and the same quarter in the previous year (392% YoY growth). Despite the revenue growth, the company reported a negative EPS of $-0.08, indicating a net loss for the quarter.

**Q3 2022 Report:** Another record revenue was achieved, reaching $63.1 million, with a sequential growth of 14% and an impressive YoY growth of 1,093%. The company's EPS improved slightly to $-0.07 but still remained negative. The fourth quarter revenue is expected to be lower, ranging between $51 million and $54 million, as a launch customer's push extends into 2023.

**Q4 2022 Report:** The company's revenue for Q4 reached $51.8 million, showing a healthy year-over-year growth of 88%. The full-year revenue for fiscal 2022 amounted to $211 million, reflecting substantial growth of 239% compared to the previous year. The EPS remained negative at $-0.08.

**Q1 2023 Report:** The revenue for Q1 2023 was $54.9 million. Increasing revenue by 35% in the first quarter of 2023. Revenue from their launch business was $19.6 million, up $12 million from the prior quarter. Their EPS was $-0.08, indicating a strong maintenance of their business. The second quarter is expected to show a significant revenue increase, with an estimated range of $60 million to $63 million.

Now, what does this all tell us? Firstly, they were very forthcoming with the quarterly expectations. Something one might think is not a big deal, but considering how a lot of publicly traded companies operate, this is a good thing. In each of their earnings reports, they have nearly exactly estimated their results, showing they are not attempting to mislead investors. The company has experienced impressive revenue growth throughout the reported quarters, indicating strong market performance and demand for its products/services. However, the negative EPS values suggest that the company is still operating at a net loss. From a shareholder’s perspective, the company's focus should be on achieving profitability and reducing the negative EPS, while maintaining consistent revenue growth. In my opinion, this stock is sitting just below a fair market value for what it is right now, sitting at just over $4, considering they are not fully profitable. Yet Rocket Lab continues to grow its business, making more contracts, and it stands a competitive chance. If they can turn a profit within 2-3 years, I think they will be one hell of a company. With their competitors failing left and right and none finding the success as Rocket Lab—other than Space X—they could stand to be a massive company in a few decades, so massive, they’re bigger than Earth.

One last financial point to touch upon… shorting, so here is some data, which is roughly one month outdated due to my difficulty in finding up-to-date information on the company without a Bloomberg Terminal (So, if anyone on the sub has access to a Bloomberg Terminal and would like to add to my DD in the comments, please do).

**Last Record Date:** May 15, 2023

**Outstanding Shares:** 478,660,000 shares

**Float Size:** 262,310,000 shares

**Short Percent of Float:** 9.80% (The short percent of float represents the percentage of shares available for trading that have been sold short).

**Average Trading Volume:** 4,044,396 shares

**Current Short Volume:** 25,710,000 shares

**Previous Short Volume:** 24,630,000 shares

**Change Vs. Previous Month**: +4.38%

**Dollar Volume Sold Short:** $111.58 million

**Short Interest Ratio / Days to Cover:** 7.7 (This ratio indicates the number of days it would take for the short sellers to cover their positions based on the average daily trading volume.).

The short interest in Rocket Lab has increased from the previous month, with a change of +4.38%. The short percent of the float is 9.80%, indicating that a significant portion of the available shares for trading has been sold short. Now, Rocket Lab’s short interest is relatively low for a company that has had consistent negative EPS and revenue. Showcasing that the big players in markets either A) believe this company will make a massive turnaround in the near future (1-3 years mark) or B) Rocket Lab, due to its size, is thankfully not on their radar. However, that said, the off-exchange short percentage is 57.69%, showcasing that A) public on-exchange short volume is a complete hoax and Hedge Funds, and other big players are beating down on the stock or B) all of this information is completely misrepresented to retail traders on purpose and the entirety of the United States market system is a complete farce.

# Section 3: Future Prospects & Big Moves

Rocket Lab has demonstrated strong performance and growth potential in the emerging small satellite launch market. The company continues to refine its launch processes, aiming to increase launch frequency and reduce costs further. Additionally, Rocket Lab has plans to develop a larger reusable rocket called Neutron, targeting the medium-lift market segment, which would expand its capabilities and market reach. The company has the potential to be the go-to company for low Earth orbital launches in the short term and in the long term, one of, if not the go-to company, for transportation to the Moon, Mars, and Venus.

[Peter Beck, founder, and CEO of Rocket Lab, did an interview last month on his take on the industry and their future prospects. I wanted to touch briefly on this \(you can find the video on YouTube\).](https://preview.redd.it/mat09lfkpd4b1.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2e79c001150d884821e4146702932d27b59a72d)

Firstly, the video begins with the commentator stating, ""*With the Space Race this week*,"" the Space X rocket, the most powerful ever built, has scrubbed its launch. While Rocket Lab is adding a new service for testing hypersonic sub-orbital launches, being a welcome addition to the company’s wide array of services. Beck states that it is a very exciting time, stating that “*the United States is kind of lacking behind in hypersonic technologies and this is a great opportunity to have high cadence, test flight environment for these payloads to really move forward the US’s hypersonic research*.” He goes on to talk about how these capabilities are essentially repurposed from Rocket Lab’s Electron Rocket capabilities: “*We take a standard Electron orbital-class launch vehicle and we fly it in some really unique trajectories to provide these hypersonic trajectories… it is taking an Electron and making a couple wee tweaks to it and having a great high frequency hypersonic testing platform that hasn’t existed*.” Beck goes on to speak on the launch cadence “*being on target for 15 flights*” this year with the fastest turn around this year being 7 days between flights, saying “*the machine is cranking and the vehicles are flying successfully and the last flight was a reusable vehicle and we splashed that down successfully and now we’re kind at the point where we are recycling and harvesting engines and components off of those launch vehicles and getting ready to put them back into service and re-fly them*.” He continues, stating, “*I’m not sure if I’m allowed to say exactly, but… a whole multiple gambit of reused components that are all now re-entering the production line and going back into service*.” Morgan Brennan, the interviewer then speaks to how there is this emerging mismatch between supply and demand when it comes to the satellite launch market, with the fact that there are so many satellite constellations that are poised to go into orbit in the coming years and not enough capacity in terms of launching them. So, she then asks about the reusability of Electron and the development of the Neutron. Beck states that, “*Electron is really serving that market very well, and there are lots of flight opportunities that are sort of just doing its thing, Neutron is the new flight opportunity for us… 2026 to 2030 timeframe there is a massive deficit in launch and there are lots of constellations that are all really vying for an ability to get in orbit, so we saw that coming and started work on the vehicle and hopefully we can bring it into service in 2024 and really solve some of those problems and take advantage of that market opportunity*.”

Now, I don’t have to tell you all that this is very good to hear from Beck and this is very exciting, showcasing that he really believes Rocket Lab can penetrate this market and become a big player in the ever-evolving industry.

**Rocket Lab Making Big Moves Lately:**

· Bought Virgin Orbit HQ in California, this was a big win for the company, and folk on the sub were very excited to see this happen. Yay! But, sad and unfortunate for Virgin Galactic, which I am sure many of us space enthusiasts had higher hopes for, oh well, not everyone can achieve their dreams.

· Rocket Lab reached a new Company record of nine launches within a calendar year.

· Achieved a record of 100% mission success for Electron launches for the year.

· Successfully launched CAPSTONE mission to the Moon for NASA, including the first demonstration of Lunar Photon spacecraft platform.

· Successfully deployed two satellites to space for NASA’s TROPICS mission on the first of two dedicated launches on Electron for the constellation scheduled in May 2023.

· Secured another NASA mission to Electron’s 2023 launch manifest with its Starling mission. Rocket Lab was selected by NASA to launch the Starling mission on an expedited timeline due to long delays and uncertainty with the mission’s original launch provider.

· Signed multiple new launch contracts on Electron for 2023 for undisclosed commercial satellite customers previously manifested on another small launch vehicle, demonstrating Electron’s strong position as a reliable and dependable ride to orbit for small satellite operators.

· Introduced Rocket Lab’s new HASTE launch vehicle, a suborbital testbed launch vehicle derived from the Company’s Electron rocket to provide reliable, high-cadence flight test opportunities to support the development of advanced hypersonic systems technology.

· Announced that the Company will fly a pre-launched 3D printed Rutherford engine on an upcoming mission in Q3’23, a major step in evolving the Electron launch vehicle into a reusable rocket.

· Delivered financial results that exceeded the high end of prior guidance for revenue and gross margin.

· Launched three successful Electron missions in the first quarter for commercial constellation operators HawkEye 360, Capella Space, and BlackSky.

· Successfully completed the Company’s first launch from its U.S. launch site, Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2, at the Virginia Spaceport Authority’s Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on January 24, 2023. The mission deployed three satellites for radio frequency geospatial analytics provider HawkEye 360.

· Successfully completed the Company’s fastest turnaround between launches to date – just seven days between its 34th Electron launch, “Stronger Together”, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 in Virginia on March 16, 2023, and its 35th Electron launch, “The Beat Goes On”, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand on March 24, 2023.

· Rocket Lab remains the only U.S. commercial small launch provider to successfully deliver satellites to orbit in 2023. Secured a multi-mission contract with Capella Space to launch four more dedicated launches on Electron in 2023.

· Achieved programmatic milestones for the Company’s two Photon spacecraft to support NASA’s ESCAPADE mission to Mars, and for the Photon spacecraft for a Varda Space Industries’ mission to manufacture high-value products in zero gravity. Both Photon programs include Rocket Lab star trackers, reaction wheels, solar panels, flight software, and radios – demonstrating the value and strength of the Company’s vertical integration and in-house supply chain.

# Conclusion: An Ode to Humanity's Future

Rocket Lab has established itself as a leading player in the small satellite launch market, offering dedicated launch services tailored to the needs of small satellite operators. The company's technological capabilities, solid customer base, and innovative approach position it well for future growth.

Those who lived and grew up in the 1960s and 1970s believed that by the 21st century, mankind would be a space-faring civilization. People had a fascination with the unknown. It was embedded in pop culture, in movies like the 2001 Space Odyssey, Alien, and the Star Trek series. But the unfortunate truth is that after Apollo 17 on the 19th of December 1972, mankind has not left low-earth orbit. The American public lost interest, the government cut funding, and the Saturn V rockets were dismantled and replaced by space shuttles in the 1980s (spaceships not even built to leave low-earth orbit). The curiosity and desire to unravel the mystery of the universe are now again filling the hearts of people. Technology is becoming more advanced and cheaper.

With companies like Rocket Lab and Space X, the future is looking bright. We currently live in an era of mass information. One of the hardest aspects of life in the early-21st-century is learning how to filter all this information. The news of the accomplishments of Rocket Lab, Space X, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA), the European Space Agency (ESA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Space Force, are lost in the large volume of collective data. The average person does not believe how close we are to colonizing Luna and Mars; how close we are to becoming a multi-planetary species. If you walked up to someone on the street of New York City, today, and told them that in the mid-2040s, and by the latest, the 2050s, there will be hundreds if not thousands of people living in Earth's orbit, the upper atmosphere of Venus, the Moon, and Mars, the person would dismiss you in disbelief. But the same would have happened if you walked up to a person on the street of New York City on the 19th of July 1962 (before Kennedy’s speech) and told them that mankind would step foot on the moon in seven years. Companies like Rocket Lab, which will make orbital flight and transportation affordable, will allow for a new era of civilization, one which was only present and dreamed of in science fiction of the past.

In response to the bears (aka the liberal arts bull case for RKLB),"A few days ago I had an exchange with a guy who posted various pics Archimedes vs Raptor rockets.   A link to the thread ( https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/s/HOahYRJsur ), but the guy’s comments were deleted either by himself or the mods(?).  

In any event, it started out as just one of any number of posts going on about space x being so far ahead that nobody can compete.  I think the poster was a provocateur but also argued in good faith.  I found him to be broadly representative of a demographic of investor whose biases (technical snobbery and industry experience) are commonly found in arguments against Rocket Lab.  I think that those points are worth further discussion. 

I’m NOT an engineer (and this poster snidely pointed this out, in response to my comment that I don’t care about Archimedes looking like a wiry mess compared to Raptor).  I’m also not a quant of any type.  I focus on soft factors - culture, broad market structure, political and social movements.  I am a liberal arts shit head investor, and am proud to be one.  I was on NVIDIA in early 2022 (after many techies, yes,  but still before the market as a whole) because I read some novels about AI and read about GPT 3.  Not to toot my own horn, but focusing on soft factors like “how will other people perceive this technology?” and “where are the potential bottlenecks in developing it?” and “what companies are critical to this but have relatively low overall public awareness?” were critical to pointing me to Nvidia.  Much of the same analysis points me to Rocket Lab.

“Rocket Lab is technically inferior to Space X”.  Nobody disputes this. I take it as a given.  There is a wide gulf.  But does it matter?  Only if the technological gap cannot be overcome in the long run.  Why would Space X have an insurmountable technological moat?  It could only be one of three reasons:

1. The tech is too hard to replicate
2. The talent for developing the tech will only be at Space X
3. Space X will drive its competitors out of business before they can attain technological parity. 

As to 1, this is not true.  Saturn V rockets have existed for like 50 years.  Building rockets is hard but it does not require any significant breakthrough in fundamental science to match Space X.  I think this is not controversial.  It’s a question of scaling, money, processes, quality control, not fundamental scientific knowledge. 

As to 2: the commenter argued something to the effect that given space X’s advantage, no engineer would want to work for RKLB. This , frankly , struck me as prime Boomer Logic.  We have seen time and again that top talent wants to take risks and get exposure to upside.  Yes many engineers like to work for a more established company, but many will simply want the challenge, glory, and financial rewards associated with working for start up (or in RKLBs case, a mature start up with room to run).  

As to 3: Beck himself often rightly points out that monopolies usually do not last in the long run.  While this is less true in extremely capital intensive industries , he is generally correct and his point is buttressed by 2 additional facts.  A) space is a national security issue and B) Space X is and must remain a privately held company ( if it is to continue to pursue its mars goal).

I asked the poster to tell me who controlled airplane manufacturing during World War 2.  He responded a small number of companies incestuously subcontracted with each other and later consolidated into a handful of mega contractors due to government intervention. He made my point for me.  Vital national defense concerns are never run by pure monopoly; oligopoly is the rule.  This is because the market is artificial.  The government cannot tolerate a single company having a chokehold on vital capacity such as launch and space systems manufacture.  It requires somewhat competitive bidding.  It requires redundancies.  It also requires its contractors to satisfy national security laws regarding sourcing, supply chain, secrecy, clearances, etc.  Rocket Lab has come farther than any of its direct competitors (other than, obviously, Space X) in terms of being able to satisfy the governments requirements and delivering a product that works as advertised.  At minimum, Rocket Lab can deliver components for other launch providers ; the best case is that it can be one of 3-4 major government contractors in terms of taking payloads into orbit. 

The private vs public structure is also quite important.  Public companies are subject to disclosure laws that do not apply to private companies.  Control is dispersed, not concentrated in one person or small group.  This is a superior governance structure for the purposes of winning public confidence and political support.  Space X cannot go public in the near term because its stated goal of going to Mars will be severely compromised by introducing any form of outside governance.  I do take Musk at his word; mars is THE objective. Thus, it must remain in the hands of an idiosyncratic billionaire with many political enemies.  All the more reason for US and world governments to foster competition and incubate alternatives. 

None of this is to say that rocket lab will come out as one of the favored group of competitors- it is still a long, hard road with a lot of risk.  But I do not buy the thesis that SpaceX is untouchable and I do believe that RKLB is one of the top contenders.",105,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1g8mmdo/in_response_to_the_bears_aka_the_liberal_arts/

What Are Wall Street Analysts Missing in Rocket Lab's Growth Story? The decade long accelerating relationship between Rocket Lab and the US Department of Defense,"EDIT: What Are Wall Street Analysts Missing in Rocket Lab's Growth Story? series:

4. [Reaction Wheels Megaconstellation Customer confirmed by the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cni62v/reaction_wheels_megaconstellation_customer/)

The Q1 2024 earnings call had only 2 of 23 questions relating to the Rocket Lab's military business despite the fact that more than half of value of all Rocket Lab's enforceable contracts (also known as the backlog) come from the US military and Rocket Lab is the DoD prime contract. Let's take a look at the Rocket Lab's military business.

This relationship started in 2009 with the launch of Ātea-1, the Rocket Lab's very first rocket, from New Zealand. This launch impressed the United States Department of Defense's (DoD) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). **In 2010 DARPA invited Peter Beck, the Rocket Lab's founder and CEO, to meet with them, which resulted in a contract to develop** ""*a rocket-based system for flying a camera high into the sky at a moment's notice. The year was 2010, and commercial drones that could be chucked up into the air by schoolchildren did not yet exist.*"" The name of the project was ""**Instant Eyes**"". Rocket Lab's demo of this product for the DoD was in 2011 and it started to sell in 2012.

**Following DARPA's lead, Operationally Responsive Space Office (ORSO) and Office of Naval Research (ONR) funded more Rocket Lab's projects including the viscous liquid monopropellant (VLM)**. After successfully producing the VLM, **Rocket Lab took this even further by aiming to ""*****put it inside a Rocket Lab-made version of the US military's AIM-9 Sidewinder missile.*****""** Further according to Vance, the transition from the military rocket to Electron development went as follows: ""*DARPA initially gave Rocket Lab money to produce prototypes of the technology and then, liking what is saw, cut Rocket Lab another check to go ahead and fly the thing.* \[*...*\] *The following day, the test bolstered the case for those who had supported Beck.* ***Rocket Lab had hoped to build a machine that outperformed the US military's state-of-the-art technology - and it did exactly that.*** \[...\] *Not long after the demonstration, Beck held an all-hands meeting in Rocket Lab's tiny IRL office. A handful of twentysomethings watched as he unveiled what the company would do next.* \[...\] *He was going to fly to Silicon Valley, and he was not going to come back without a big bag of cash. Rocket Lab was going to make a real rocket.*""

In 2020, Michael Griffith has joined the Board of Directors: ""***Griffin served as Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, overseeing the establishment of the Space Development Agency (SDA)****. In this role he was responsible for research, development, and prototyping activities across the DoD enterprise, mandated with ensuring technological superiority for the Department of Defense. He also oversaw the activities of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Missile Defense Agency, the Defense Innovation Unit, the Strategic Capabilities Office, the DoD Laboratory enterprise, and the Under Secretariate staff focused on developing advanced technology and capability for the U.S. military. Griffin also served as the 11th NASA Administrator, a role in which he initiated the first development of commercial cargo delivery service to Earth orbit in the agency’s history.*""

In 2021, United States Space Force Space Systems Command (SSC) awarded $24 million to Rocket Lab for the Neutron's upper stage development. Rocket Lab commented on that as follows: ""***awarding of this contract recognizes Rocket Lab as a potential NSSL Phase 3 Launch provider from 2025***"".

In 2023, Lt. Gen. Nina Armagno, former United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Space Force (USSF), has joined the Board of Directors: ""***Lt. Gen. Armagno joins the Rocket Lab Board after serving more than 35 years in leadership positions for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force***. During her service in the U.S. Armed Forces, ***she served as the Director of Plans & Policy for the U.S. Strategic Command*** *and as* ***the Director for Space Programs at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Acquisition for the Air Force***. She was the first lieutenant general officer appointed to, and Director of Staff for, the Space Force where she established the first new military branch in 72 years, ***before retiring from active duty in July 2023***. ***She had previously commanded the 30******^(th)******and 45******^(th)*** ***Space Wings, the 21******^(st)*** ***Operations Group, and the 6******^(th)*** ***Space Warning Squadron.***""

In 2024, New Zealand got unilaterally included under the military trade law without New Zealand even knowing about it, which may release Rocket Lab's stuff from ITAR restrictions? Here' the excerpt from the article: ""*The US has included New Zealand under a military trade law that exists to ""support \[the\] national security objectives of the United States"" - without the New Zealand government's involvement.* \[...\] *The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the US Congress acted on its own initiative.* \[...\] *The US Embassy spokesperson said the process of amending the law was transparent. Including New Zealand ""allowed the continuation of existing technological cooperation, and... also ensured that developing bilateral space cooperation was possible"", they said. A Congress explainer said the NTIB was about ""supplying military operations; conducting advanced R&D and systems development to ensure technological superiority of the US Armed Forces; securing reliable sources of critical materials; and developing industrial preparedness to support operations in wartime or during a national emergency"". Members have been involved in F-35 joint strike fighter programme and the Pentagon is only allowed to buy satellite ""star trackers"" and certain naval components from approved NTIB manufacturers. Dual-use technologies that also have non-military uses are a focus.* \[...\] *He told RNZ he was not surprised New Zealand got added without fanfare to the NTIB. ""I sincerely doubt there were any discussions with your government before Congress acted,"" he said by email. ""The idea in essence is that if we can trust these countries with some of the US most significant secrets, we should also be able to trust them with less stringent security information about weapon systems development, production and operations. New Zealand probably registered little change, he said. However, aligning the NTIB with Five Eyes had helped* ***the US Congress accept the rationale of giving its allies a break from export controls***, a move required to implement the Aukus pact, Greenwalt said.""

The above has happened after the USSF SSC assessed New Zealand's (i.e. Rocket Lab's) capability to help with rapid rocket and satellite launches if war breaks out in space: ""*The United States has been assessing New Zealand's capability to help with rapid rocket and satellite launches if war breaks out in space. US Space Command has also asked New Zealand to join an international operation to deter space-enabled attack, focused on China and Russia.* \[...\] *Congressional records showed the US Congress ordered the Secretaries of Defence and State last year to produce ""an assessment of the benefits of leveraging allied and partner spaceports for responsive launch. New Zealand launches more rockets than any other US ally in the Five Eyes intelligence group. It is in an elite group of five regular successful rocket launch countries, along with the US, China, Russia and India.* \[...\] ***A ""responsive"" launch - as referred to by Congress - was a rapid one ""during a conflict or a crisis"", according to Rocket Lab.*** *To test this, the NZ-US company is due to put up a satellite next year that will chase another company's satellite, under a $50m Pentagon contract to ""showcase the ability to maneuver from a real-time threat"". While New Zealand had no military launch capability, the NZDF had just set up a ground-based Pacific ""cell"" at the US's invitation, to monitor civilian and military satellite activity. Documents say this was partly to guard against a surprise space-enabled attack on US assets.* \[...\] ***The Pentagon was poised ""to sign agreements with commercial space companies that go far beyond the usual contractor relationships"" to embed private sector equipment into military units***, a US space website reported this week. The 2023 report to Congress was also aimed to assess US plans to engage with allies over such things as repairing or augmenting satellites, and an assessment of what shared costs and technology ""could be considered for allied spaceports"". The US Embassy did not address those ""shared costs"", nor did it address the invite to New Zealand to join the US-led international Operation Olympic Defender.""

Let's take a look at space systems and Electron/HASTE launches with military payloads (i.e. excluding national non-military payloads such as NASA's payloads) and other relating information to date, which I've been able to find\*:

* New Zealand included under the US military trade law

If supposed analysts were familiar with established relations between the DoD and Rocket Lab, would they still ask Rocket Lab, the DoD prime contractor with the fresh $515 million SDA contract, whether the Baltimore bridge incident had an impact on their business (none), if their $565 million in cash includes net proceeds of the recent capital raise (what else could it be?) or what is the Rocket Lab's runway (that's actually an insult to the fresh DoD prime contractor) instead of diligently poking around the Rocket Lab's military business and their lobbying? Analysts' questions suggest the lack of awareness of what's going on inside Rocket Lab's business segment, which comprises more than 60% of value of their enforceable contracts (aka backlog in the language of Rocket Lab).

Rocket Lab Acquisition / Constellation Analysis,"# Hey r/RKLB, just wanted to share some analysis I've been doing on potential acquisition targets.

Rocket Lab's track record with acquisitions follows a fairly well-defined pattern. Let's take a look at the companies they have purchased thus far:

* **SolAero Technologies** - $80m - Dec '21 - Provider of high performance solar panels - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-space-solar-power-products-company-solaero-holdings-inc/)
* **Planetary System Corp (PSC)** - $42m + 1.7m shares - Dec '21 - Provider of separation systems - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-space-hardware-company-planetary-systems-corporation/)
* **Advanced Solutions Inc (ASI)** - $40m - Oct '21 - Flight software, mission sim, and guidance + nav software - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-acquires-space-software-company-advanced-solutions-inc/)
* **Sinclair Interplanetary** - $ Unknown - Apr - '20 - Satellite components (reaction wheels, star trackers, etc) - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-satellite-hardware-manufacturer-sinclair-interplanetary/)

Here is a section of an interview with CEO Peter Beck explaining the methodology behind Rocket Lab's acquisitions: [https://youtu.be/T\_\_1ubfs\_iE?t=1313](https://youtu.be/T__1ubfs_iE?t=1313)

* ""If the supply chain can not provide us the surety to deliver what we need, then we’ll go and vertically integrate""
* “If it’s too expensive and it’s too slow, generally we need to own it because we can make it cheaper and faster”
* ""Is this going to be strategically important to us in the future for stuff that we think we're going to do""

To summarize, Rocket Lab's acquisitions have all been vertical integration plays; bringing some aspect of their supply chain in house to either reduce lead times, unit cost, or both. Peter has mentioned in multiple interviews that all of these companies have scaled and integrated successfully into Rocket Lab's business.

Note how most of these acquisitions support the production and manufacturing of satellite **buses**. A quick review: satellites can be described as being comprised of a **bus** and a **payload.**

**Bus** - the main structure and infrastructure of a satellite, providing the necessary support systems for the payload to operate effectively. It includes power, structure, solar panels, propulsion, thermal control, attitude control, communication, and on-board computer systems.

**Payload** - the primary instrumentation or equipment on a satellite that performs the specific mission or function, such as sensing, communication, or experimentation, and is the reason the satellite is launched into space.  
  

Rocket Lab can currently produce satellite buses quickly, cost effectively, and at scale. Payloads? Not so much. 

# I think Rocket Lab's next acquisition will be a payload company. A company that specializes communications equipment, imaging/sensors, etc.

It's been clearly communicated by leadership that Rocket Lab plans on building a LEO constellation. If/when they do announce an acquisition of a payload company, we will be able to make some pretty big assumptions about the type of constellation they will build.

I do not think Rocket Lab will build out a direct to consumer mega constellation a la Starlink or Kuiper based on the following:

* Starlink's original estimated cost to design, build and deploy was $10 Billion  [source](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/05/block-5-spacex-increase-launch-cadence-lower-prices/)
* Amazon reportedly invested $10 Billion in the Kuiper project in 2020 [source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/fcc-authorizes-amazon-to-build-kuiper-satellite-internet-network.html)
* Comments from CFO Adam Spice :

>""the broadband from space application that SpaceX targeted with Starlink, that's probably not what we will be going for just given the amount of capital required"" [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=1059)

>""but there's lots of very interesting applications that required dozens or hundreds of satellites not 40 thousand satellites"" [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=1070)

While it's possible they could pursue a smaller 5G constellation similar to AST SpaceMobile, I think AST's tech moat is wide enough that other opportunities make more sense.

# I think it's likely that we see a smaller 100-200 satellite constellation purpose built and marketed towards military applications.

These satellites could provide access to a suite of sensors, communication systems, radar, antennas, etc., and deliver tailored services to DoD customers. A few points supporting that:

* Rocket Lab is prime DoD contractor as of Dec '23, acting as prime for the $515m SDA Tranche 2 Transport Layer - Beta contract. According to Adam Spice this:

>""opens up a lot of opportunities for us"" .. ""we think it's a huge enabler to grow that government exposure"".  [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=515)

* Sitting Board member Nina Armagno, among many other things, **was the first director of staff of the United States Space Force** and was responsible for helping to establish the organizational framework, policies and procedures, building relationships with other branches, etc.  [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/about/team/)
* The business is already heavily focused on gov customers. SDA, ESCAPADE, HASTE, CAPSTONE, TROPICS, etc, all make up a huge chunk of rocket lab's revenue already.

# Ok. So if it's likely that the acquisition is a payload company, and it's likely that the payload would be for a constellation built for servicing DoD customers, I think I know where to look...

# [Here is a list of subcontractors that Rocket Lab selected to help fulfill the SDA contract](https://spaceimpulse.com/2024/05/07/rocket-lab-selects-subcontractors-for-sda-satellite-constellation/#:~:text=The%20selected%20subcontractors%20include%20CesiumAstro,Redwire%20Space%2C%20and%20Parsons%20Corporation)

What do you know, a bunch of **payload** companies (mostly).

* **CesiumAstro** - $260-390m [source](https://app.dealroom.co/companies/cesiumastro) - will provide its Vireo active electronically scanned array (AESA) radio frequency (RF) communications payload, known as the first multi-beam-capable Ka-band communications system for SDA’s PWSA.
* **Mynaric** - $93m Mkt Cap - will supply CONDOR Mk3 optical communication terminals, enhancing free space optical communications for air, space, and mobile applications.
* **Redwire Space** - 450m Mkt Cap - has been chosen for its expertise in antennas and RF hardware.
* **Parsons Corp** - 10b Mkt Cap - will provide the NEBULA Operations – Vendor Architecture (NOVA), serving as Rocket Lab’s ground system for the operational management of its 18 satellites.
* **SEAKR Engineering** - Acquired by Raytheon - will offer its Tactical Satellite Communications (TACSATCOM) Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Network Encryption System (NES).
* **Collins Aerospace** - Acquired by Safran Group -  is set to deliver the waveform necessary for the SDR, essential software and firmware for TACSATCOM’s transmission and reception.

# Cash Situation

Rocket Lab's current Cash and Equivalents and marketable securities etc is $546.8m ([source - slide 37](https://s28.q4cdn.com/737637457/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/FINAL-Rocket-Lab-Q2-2024-Earnings-Presentation.pdf))

All the previous acquisitions have been in the $40-80m range (Sinclair likely less)

Adam Spice gave guidance in the Q2 '24 earnings call that capex for Neutron R&D was expected to tick up in the in the second half of 2024 [source](https://youtu.be/lE9SPN_bIhc?t=3634)

Adam Spice on whether they would do another cap raise - ""Right now we don't see anything that would cause us to go back to capital markets"" but did provide a caveat that for the right opportunity, it's a possibility [source](https://youtu.be/lE9SPN_bIhc?t=5751)

So it's not likely they would raise capital for an acquisition, but it's also not off the table.

Obviously the last three subcontractors on the list aren't an option, and $450m for Redwire seems a bit steep given the cash on hand. **Mynaric** and **CesiumAstro** both fit the profile and around the price range we are looking for.

Do I think one of these companies will be acquired by Rocket Lab? **I don't know**.

Do I think a company *like* Mynaric or CesiumAstro will be acquired by Rocket Lab? **Yes.**

Here's a few predictions:

* I think the first constellation Rocket Lab builds will be less than 200 satellites
* I think it will be purpose built to serve the DoD, possibly partnering with a branch to actually fund the first tranche of satellites
* If there is an acquisition, I feel very confident that it will be a payload company
* Without a cap raise, I think $100m is the most we could afford to spend on an acquisition (assuming no Neutron delays etc)

# TL;DR I don't know if/who they will acquire but wrote this as a framework to (hopefully) start a discussion anchored around the type and size company I think fits the bill.",101,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1evtjur/rocket_lab_acquisition_constellation_analysis/

Here's my take on Apple's $1.5 billion investment and the impact it could have on RKLB,"***\\!/ This is not financial advice \\!/***

For those who aren't aware already, Apple has just announced on Friday a $1.5 billion satellite investment with Globalstar to improve space-based communications for iPhones. The deal is expected to close on Nov. 5.

Here is all the information I could find in order to form a realistic expectation on the effects such a deal could have on RKLB.

First things first, Globalstar is the company with which Apple has been partnering with since 2022 to offer emergency services on its latest iPhones when terrestrial networks are unavailable. Globalstar is managing the constellation Apple uses to provide that service. It is specified in the deal that Apple will make cash payments of $1.1 billion to help Globalstar fund the new network of satellites but, it is also said that SpaceX is expected to begin launching those new satellites next year. It is important to note that Globalstar's constellation is in LEO (low-earth orbit) and that  their network does not \*yet\* provide more bandwidth-hungry services such as voice and broadband as of today.

**Back to 2022's subcontract with MDA:**

RocketLab is directly involved in Globalstar's ""old"" constellation because in 2022, RKLB was awarded a subcontract by MDA ""to lead the design and manufacture of 17 spacecraft buses for Globalstar’s new Low Earth Orbit satellites"". MDA is the company that initially got the contrat to build those 17 new satellites. Rocket Lab is also developing the Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC) for the constellation. The Globalstar SOCC includes a continuous satellite control and monitoring using Rocket Lab’s MAX GDS, a constellation-class ground software solution that provides complete spacecraft command and control. What is also important to note is that the telemetry and control radio for all spacecraft will also be a C-band variant of Rocket Lab’s Frontier Satellite Radio (Frontier-C). Rocket Lab's Frontier Satellite Radios are Software-defined radio (SDR). SDRs are a radio communication system where components that conventionally have been implemented in analog hardware (e.g. mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, etc.) are instead implemented by means of software on a computer or embedded system. 

**What are spacecraft buses?:**

Spacecraft buses can be referred to as satellite platforms which are the support on which to mount instruments and the infrastructure for the mission such as power, communications to the ground and navigation. A spacecraft bus consists of everything needed to transport, protect, and operate the payload. In our case, RKLB was in charge of the manufacturing of the satellite platforms in the 2022 contract and MDA was in charge of the payload which is the primary function of the satellite's mission. 

**MDA's new Aurora satellites:**

MDA announced their new Aurora satellite line in March 2024. Aurora is a new software-defined satellite product line which is basically a transition from analog to digital satellite technology. MDA has also made new partnerships with new companies to supply components for Aurora. 

Here's a list of a few partnerships I could find: 

1. Aerospacelab announced July 8, 2024 that it will provide more than 200 battery charge regulators for MDA Space’s Aurora satellites over a three-year period starting in 2026. These components are used to manage power distribution and battery charging in satellite systems. 
2. Airbus will supply more than 200 Sparkwing solar arrays that will be built on a designated line at Airbus' high-capacity production facility in Leiden, the Netherlands.
3. Switzerland’s Huber+Suhner was selected to supply more than 60,000 multi-channel radio frequency (RF). 

The list above refers to components that are used in the manufacturing of a satellite platform/satellite bus. If MDA was still using RKLB's satellite platforms, why would they buy components which are generally used for the making of the satellite platform and not the payload? 

Also, SDR setup involves an RF front-end connected to a computer that will perform the conversions from analog to digital. In other words and from my understanding, multi-channel radio refrequency (RF) is a component used in the making of a Software-defined radio (SDR). If MDA was still using RKLB's SDRs, why would they buy multi-channel frequency systems from another supplier? 

Obviously, I'm not an aerospace engineer or anywhere near that job industry, but prior to the launch of their new Aurora line, I personally think MDA needed RKLB's SDR to actually make their precedent satellite line ""Software-defined"". Since they've now developed their own fully software-defined satellite line, it doesn't seem like they'd still use RKLB's components. Also, the latest contracts for Aurora satellites do not mention any partnership with RKLB. In fact, MDA's press release in August 2023 about their contract with Telesat briefly mentions a new line of satellite and a transition from analog to software-defined satellites. It also seems like, by the recent partnerships MDA made for Aurora's components, that MDA is now making their very own satellite buses also. 

**From all the information above, here's what I think:**

1. It doesn't seem like RKLB is going to be the launch provider since SpaceX is already slated to begin launches in 2025. 
2. In November 2023, MDA received an Authorization to Proceed (ATP) contract from an undisclosed customer to start work on a new Non-Geostationary Orbit (NGSO) satellite constellation (valued at $180 million). The definitive contract for the full constellation (valued at around $750 million) is expected in 2024. We can hope for the unnamed customer to be linked to Apple's new investment since the contract and the constellation' valuations both make sense, price wise, with the total investment made by Apple's and the $1.1 billion payments that will be made to Globalstar in order to help them fund the new constellation. The timeline between the ATP with MDA and Apple's announcement for their new investment also both make sense. However, if that contract actually turns out to be tied to Apple's new investment, I'm not really optimistic on the fact that Rocket Lab is still involved in the spacecraft bus manufacturing.
3. Because Apple's main objective with their new investment is to improve space-based communications for iPhones, I see this new investment as an extension to their first partnership with Globalstar back in 2022. That being said, I think it would make sense if Globalstar continues to use Rocket Lab's constellation-class ground software for their new satellite constellation because from my understanding, the new constellation's purpose is to act as a complement to the one currently operated. 
4. Globalstar didn't want to elaborate on the upgrades their new constellation would bring to space-based communications on iPhones. By looking at RKLB's old press releases about the 2022 contract, I've found this very precise sentence: ""These new satellites and SOCC will augment Globalstar’s existing constellation delivering reliable mobile satellite voice and data services from space."" However, Globalstar's current constellation does not \*yet\* provide more bandwidth-hungry services such as voice and broadband as of today. Is it possible that the new satellites partly built by RKLB would provide such an upgrade to GlobalStar's currently offered services? 

I'd like to know what you guys think and feel free to share your opinion! 

Once again, this is not financial advice and this message only reflects my own thoughts after doing my very own DD. I do own shares of the company because I like the stock. ",100,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1gi7xzm/heres_my_take_on_apples_15_billion_investment_and/

3 Millionaire-Maker Space Stocks

Historically, space exploration and putting satellites into orbit has been within the purview of government-funded agencies like NASA.

That's changing, though. For-profit corporations can handle this work at least as cost-effectively as government-run organizations can. Elon Musk's SpaceX recently facilitated the world's first-ever private citizen spacewalk, for example, while Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is mainstreaming space tourism. Blue Origin's newest rocket will even soon be launching two Mars probes for NASA.

This is only the beginning of privatized work in outer space, now that technology not only allows for it, but necessitates it. Market research outfits Polaris and Precedence agree that launch services alone will be roughly a $50 billion-per-year business within a decade. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley and Citi both predict that the entirety of the science, technology, and services businesses linked to space will be worth on the order of $1 trillion by 2040.

Connect the dots. There's real investment opportunity here.

The top opportunities, however, aren't likely to be the obvious names. The potential millionaire-making space stocks are likely to be the lower-profile stocks that could even be considered a little off the radar. Here's a closer look at three of your better bets among such prospects.



Rocket Lab USA

It may not be a household name, but Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ: RKLB) has been very busy for quite some time now. Since its very first launch in May 2017, this company has put over 190 satellites into orbit. Its technology (like software, solar panels, radios, etc.) is also found inside more than 1,700 different satellites, as well as the James Webb Space Telescope. The two aforementioned Mars probes will also be flying with Rocket Lab tech on board.

While there's a clear market for satellite launches, Rocket Lab's been at it for a while. For any ticker to offer real millionaire-making potential, the company must mostly be undiscovered. That, or it needs to be doing something new that most investors don't yet fully appreciate. In this case it's the latter.

To date, all of this company's launches have utilized its so-called Electron rocket. It's perfectly fine for putting small satellites into orbit, but it's not powerful enough to lift larger satellites, exploration craft, or people into space.

That's coming, though. The Neutron rocket expected to start flying next year will be a so-called medium-lift vehicle capable of carrying bigger machinery. In fact, it will even be able to provide the initial liftoff for missions to Mars and Venus. The Neutron rocket will also be reusable, making it cost-effective for the company as well as its customers. Perhaps most important, the soon-to-launch Neutron rocket will provide real competition to SpaceX, which currently dominates the medium-lift market.

And interest is definitely firming up even before its first commercial flight. The U.S. Space Force has already provided funding to co-develop an upper stage of Rocket Lab's Neutron rocket as part of the Department of Defense's efforts to ensure it's able to secure and defend the United States wherever and however it needs to.



AST SpaceMobile

AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ: ASTS) isn't nearly as far along as Rocket Lab USA is on the commercialization front. In fact, the company only recently launched its first-ever commercial satellites. These certainly won't be the last, however, now that the underlying technology has been proven and perfected.

It's not an apples-to-apples comparison. Whereas Rocket Lab designs tech for others' satellites as well as a means of putting them into orbit, as the name implies, AST SpaceMobile offers mobile broadband connectivity via satellites rather than cellphone towers. This tech is capable of connecting anyone to the worldwide web regardless of where they are -- no physical infrastructure (other than a functioning, web-capable phone) required.

At first blush, it seems like a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. You likely don't have any trouble connecting to the web, whether that be with your phone or a computer. That's not necessarily the norm, however, and that line of thinking underestimates a growing challenge.

See, as the world becomes increasingly connected -- including our cars -- our telecom infrastructure is being pushed to its limits. Much of the developed world is now running low on radio frequencies to assign to mobile phones and cell towers. Offloading this data traffic to fiberoptic connections has certainly helped, but handling such constant switchovers en masse can be technically complex as well, and still won't fully meet future needs.

There's also the not-so-small matter that such connectivity frameworks are vulnerable to power outages and other sorts of disruption.

Satellite-based connectivity, however, sidesteps many of those problems. It's not exactly a new idea, either. Even if not always practical or affordable for the average consumer, satellite-driven mobile phone connectivity has been around since the 90s.

Now that it's practical as well as affordable, Polaris Market Research believes this market is poised to grow at an average annual pace of 18% through 2032. AST SpaceMobile is smack-dab in the middle of this mainstreaming movement.


Intuitive Machines

Last but not least, add Intuitive Machines (NASDAQ: LUNR) to your list of space-related stocks that could turn out to be millionaire makers.

In some ways, Intuitive Machines is the riskiest of the three stocks in question simply due to its small size and young age. Its market capitalization is a mere $375 million, and while it's now producing annual revenue in the same ballpark following its founding in 2013, it's also still operating in the red with only a little over $30 million worth of cash in the bank.

In other ways, though, Intuitive Machines is arguably the least risky of these three stocks just because it's also operating the most practical, currently marketable business. Simply put, this company is helping for-profit organizations and government agencies get back to the Moon. Whether that's drones that land on the Moon to map it or a means of putting communication satellites in a lunar orbit, Intuitive Machines has a solution.

It's prescient, too, given that the Moon has moved back into focus as the world's next space-exploration point of interest, perhaps as a place to mine or colonize, or perhaps as a test run for a manned mission to Mars.

Indeed, NASA's Artemis rocket designed specifically to return mankind to the Moon is still slated to do so sometime in the latter part of 2025 or 2026. This voyage will partially be made possible with the help Intuitive Machines has already provided and will provide in the future. The company recently announced a $117 million contract to deliver six different payloads to the Moon for NASA.

This is still just the beginning. Analysts believe growing interest in Moon trips will drive enough revenue growth for Intuitive Machines to push it out of the red and into the black by 2026. Reaching that milestone could easily send this stock on a rocket ride, so to speak.

Rocket Lab Stock Soars. Space Has Momentum.

Commercial space company Rocket Lab RKLB 12.58% posted stronger quarterly sales Thursday evening, sending shares soaring. Rocket Lab, like Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has space launch and satellite-building capabilities. SpaceX, of course, is dominant, launching almost 80 times so far in 2024. Rocket Lab has launched nine times. Investors don’t get regular quarterly updates from Musk’s privately held space company. That isn’t the case with publicly traded Rocket Lab. For the second quarter, Rocket Lab reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, of negative $21 million from sales of just over $106 million. Wall Street was looking for an Ebitda loss of $26 million from sales of just under $106 million. Better cost control, resulting in a smaller-than-expected loss, is a positive. So are higher sales. Rocket Lab’s second-quarter sales grew about 15% compared with the first quarter and more than 70% year over year. The results sent Rocket Lab shares up about 12.6% in Friday trading to $5.37 apiece. The S&P 500 SPX 0.47% and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA 0.13% gained 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively. Following the report, Stifel analyst Erik Rasmussen wrote that launch demand remains strong and that sales should jump higher in the fourth quarter following relatively flat third-quarter sales of between $100 and $105 million. Rasmussen projects $121 million in fourth-quarter sales, up more than 100% year over year. He projects 2025 sales of about $576 million, up 36% from expected 2024 sales. Rasmussen projects positive Ebitda for the company in 2026, after sales hit almost $1 billion. He rates Rocket Lab shares Buy and has a $9 price target for the stock. Through Friday trading, Rocket Lab shares were down about 4% year to date.Shares of space start-up Virgin Galactic SPCE 2.16% are down about 87% this year, despite a 14% jump on Thursday. The company reported second-quarter sales of $4.2 million on Wednesday evening. Wall Street was looking for $3.4 million. Galactic focuses, of course, on space tourism. While better-than-expected sales are positive, ramping up capacity has been harder than the company expected. Rocket Lab has had more success providing launch services for companies looking to deploy small satellites into low-earth orbit. Coming into Friday trading, Galactic’s market capitalization was below $200 million. Rocket Lab’s was north of $2.3 billion. SpaceX dwarfs them both. It’s valued at some $200 billion in private markets.

_____________________________________________________

Rocket Lab had another successful launch this morning.   Just watched them successfully deploy the Capella satellite.  I think we see $10 by the end of the year.  I also think there might be more consolidation in the space industry.  Everyone knows that to compete with Musk you have to grow as fast as possible.  I wouldn’t be surprised to see more U.S. government contracts announced for Rocket Lab.  Boeing has really dropped the ball with leaving the astronauts stuck in space.  They are not getting any contracts until they bring them home unless one of their paid servants in congress really pushes for more money for Boeing.  If two of the big companies don’t combine in the next 12 months I’ll be surprised.  ",97,48,https://i.redd.it/rgqb4oh2o1id1.jpeg

[ Rocket Lab's Electron lifts off ](https://preview.redd.it/t1s7kbc9qog91.jpg?width=860&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57afaaddfbfbf883f3735cb0d143103beb356c2b)

7:48 am ET August 9, 2022 (Dow Jones)

By Jon Sindreu

This column is part of the sixth annual Heard on the Street stock-picking contest.

Investors in 2022 have decided they hate moonshots. They should make an exception for a firm that has actually gone to the moon.

On Thursday, a spy satellite run by the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office shot into space from New Zealand. The rocket carrying it, the Electron, was built by Rocket Lab, a U.S.-Kiwi startup founded in 2006 by self-taught rocket engineer Peter Beck.

Shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, satellite-intelligence firm BlackSky asked Rocket Lab for an orbit change just days before it was due to launch, in or der to place its satellites more directly over the conflict zone. While changing such missions has traditionally taken months, Rocket Lab pulled it off in 45 days.

These are examples of the new opportunities opened up by governments' desire for ""responsive launch."" While Elon Musk's SpaceX has spent years revolutionizing the space economy with its large reusable Falcon rockets, a raft of startups have recently stepped in to provide light rockets that are more expensive in terms of price per kilogram, but can send small satellites to specific orbits with extremely fast turnaround times.

Geopolitical tensions could expand this market at warp speed as part of a broad-based defense upgrade. After devoting $50 million to responsive launch within the Pentagon's 2022 budget, lawmakers have pushed to increase this funding to $150 million for 2023. Russia's Soyuz rocket no longer being available to Western governments and firms further brightens the picture for launchers.

Yet investors are dumping their stocks. After a year of unrestrained euphoria, when all sorts of ""pre-revenue"" startups merged with special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, rising interest rates have prompted traders to shun speculative ventures, including fintech innovations, air taxis and, yes, small-satellite launchers.

This has shrouded Rocket Lab, Virgin Orbit and Astra Space, which all went public through SPACs last year, in a cloud of negative sentiment. It also casts doubt over the fate of privately owned ventures like Firefly Aerospace, Relativity Space and ABL Space Systems.

Shares in Rocket Lab are down more than 50% this year, which is in line with the fall for the AXS De-SPAC Exchange Traded Fund. But this is galactically unfair: Unlike many of the companies in that fund, Rocket Lab has actually achieved the impressive feats it promised to investors.

Beyond launching 149 satellites into space so far, Rocket Lab also sent NASA's CAPSTONE spacecraft on its way to the moon's orbit in June. A month earlier, it caught an Electron booster in midair with a helicopter -- a key step toward making the rocket reusable. For comparison's sake, Astra has suffered a number of failed launches over the past year, Firefly's Alpha rocket exploded during its first test launch, and Relativity has yet to attempt one.

This may actually understate Rocket Lab's manufacturing edge.

""Your first rocket is built by engineers in a controlled environment over years,"" Mr. Beck said. ""Your 20th rocket is built by a technician reading instructions and it's all about process.""

Furthermore, this isn't really a ""pre-revenue"" company: Sales came in at $41 million in the first quarter, a 124% on-the-year increase. It isn't yet profitable -- positive operating income is expected in 2024 -- but only because it continues to invest heavily in a larger coming rocket called the Neutron. And its business isn't just launches: Between two-thirds and three-quarters of revenues actually come from building satellite components.

When investors finally come around to discriminating between former SPACs, they may realize that Rocket Lab has long achieved escape velocity.

Rocket Lab Movie Review,"To get to what you want to hear, the movie is available on HBO MAX on July 17th.

Overall the movie is great, but not a “rocket lab” movie. It mostly covers Astra and honestly pulls no punches when talking about their failures. It also covers Planet a good bit. After Astra’s failures it cuts back to Rocket Lab doing their thing.
Both Kemp (pictured after the movie, definitely embarrassed) and the Planet Labs CEO were both in attendance and had two rows of reserved seats for people. There were 3 Rocket Lab employees there who bought their own seats (I think this speaks volumes in a good way). Firefly wasn’t put into the movie.

"All these posts about how RKLB is ""overvalued"".","I'm seeing so many posts about RKLB being overvalued. How it's not worth $5B today because it doesn't have the revenues to support that valuation. These posters are missing the point. You, I, analysts, pundits, space enthusiasts, or market experts don't decide what a stock is worth. Only the market decides what stocks are ""worth"". And currently it's saying that RKLB is worth 5B today not because of what it's actually intrinsically worth, but because that the chance of it being worth 25, 50, 100B+ in a few years is becoming more and more likely.

A lottery ticket is a piece of paper worth nothing intrinsically. You don't buy it for the value of the paper. You buy it because it comes with the opportunity for it to later actually be worth a large amount of money.

It's fine if you want to trade RKLB and try and call the tops and bottoms. Honestly I do that with about 5% of my position, it keeps me engaged with the stock price and I don't feel like I'm missing out on taking some profits. But I'm holding 95% of my position long term, because I know this stock will eventually start running and not slow down. RKLB is doing everything right and has proven itself over and over in the past. The general public is just starting to catch on.

"A multi billion contract with Amazon - Rocket Lab is supplying 12Nms reaction wheels to the Amazon's megaconstellation of 3,236 satellites, (3 to) 4 wheels per each satellite, (9,708 to) 12,944 12Nms reaction wheels with more required for maintenance and replacement","While the CEO spoke about 2,000 reaction wheels for a single customer this year, that Amaz...ing customer will eventually need 12,944\* 12Nms reaction wheels just to get the constellation into the space and then further thousands of reaction wheels for the maintenance and replacement.

If Amazon got a discount in the range of 10-30%, let's say 20% for purposes of this dive, this deal would translate into revenues between $1.035 billion and $1.242 billion, depending on the type of 12Nms reaction wheels. Further revenues would follow from reaction wheels sold for the maintenance and replacement of deorbited satellites.

There is no way that this deal is in the backlog in its entirety as the $1 billion backlog already comprises the $515 million SDA T2TL-Beta deal, $215 million in Electron launches, $143 million Apple/MDA deal, $32 million Victus Haze deal (this also includes launch, so I've deducted 8.5 million below), $30 million out of $150 million deal for solar cells for the space prime contractor and also deals with other Rocket Lab's customers (as ""x"" below).

515+215+143+23.5 + 30 + x = 926.5 + x

1014 (total backlog) - 926.5 (known backlog) - x (unknown backlog) = **87.5 - x**

**I don't see how can the deal for over 2,000 reaction wheels this year, which may be for $160 or $192 million, not even speaking about more than $1 billion for 12,944 reaction wheels for the whole constellation, be already comprised in less than $87.5 million of unidentified deals in the current backlog. It may be possible that only a very small portion of this deal is in the backlog.**

The FCC has given Amazon the deadline of July 2026 to launch 50% of the constellation, that is 1,618 satellites, which require 6,472\* 12Nms reaction wheels. These reaction wheels need to be delivered to Amazon well before July 2026 in order to allow for time to build satellites and to remedy any potential supply hiccups and/or production accidents. Let's say at least 3 months before the FCC deadline.

According to the CEO, this year, the Amaz...ing customer will consume over 2,000 reaction wheels from Rocket Lab, which translates into 500 satellites. **Amazon will need further 4,472 12Nms reaction wheels between Jan 2025 and April 2026**, which means that this further delivery should take place in space of 16 months. That is an average of 279.5 reaction wheels per month, or 838.5 reaction wheels per Q. **That would amount to quarterly revenues between $67 and $80.5 million (between $268 and $322 million per year), depending on the type of 12Nms reaction wheels, just from reaction wheels sold to Amazon.** Compare this to $60 million in revenues from all space systems customers in Q1 2024, which might include no revenue recognition from the Amazon deal.

The CFO stated that over $426 million of the current $1 billion backlog will be recognized in next 12 months. If 12Nms reaction wheels for Amazon were in the contract then subtracting $268 or $322 million for reaction wheels from the $426 million which will be recognized in next 12 months would leave only $158 or $104 million to be recognized from all other space systems revenue streams and launches. That would mean that Rocket Lab would do only 19 launches in next 12 months (till the end of May 2025) and that Rocket Lab would recognize zero revenues from any other space systems customer beside Amazon, which is nonsense. **12Nms reaction wheels are thus missing from the backlog.** **However, the deal exists as the CEO confirmed it. There is no other megaconstellation builder beside SpaceX and Amazon who would consume over 2,000 12Nms reaction wheels this year and while SpaceX is building their own reaction wheels, Amazon lacks such capability.**

**Let's go back to 2024. Over 2,000 12Nms reaction wheels in 2024 may translate into revenues of $160 million or $192 million, that is $40 million or $48 million per quarter if they would be recognized over the all quarters of 2024.**

These revenues do not seem to be recognized in Q1 2024 as space systems revenues increased by $8.5 million from $51.5 million (Q4 2023) to $60 million (Q1 2024).

Recognizing them over the remaining 3 quarters in 2024 would amount to a jump in revenues by $53 million or $64 million. There is a jump the the Q2 2024 guidance but not on such magnitude that it could be wholly attributed to a supply of 666 12Nms reaction wheels (1/3 of 2,000 to be consumed by Amazon this year).

This leaves us with a big potential jump in the Q3 2024 guidance.

\* 9,708, ie. 3 reaction wheels per satellite instead of 4 reaction wheels, would be contrary to redundancy and a risk taking that Amazon is not known for.

**Rocket Lab secures Neutron funding**. Rocket Lab announced this week that it has closed $355 million of convertible senior notes as the company seeks to bridge to its next-generation Neutron rocket. Payload Research has the details on the financing, including an explanation of what the convertible notes mean for Rocket Lab as well as investors. Interestingly, the company's publicly traded stock plummeted 17 percent on the day of the announcement amid concerns over dilution and rising debt servicing costs.

*Still, it gets them to Neutron* ... The company estimates it will spend roughly $250 million to build the medium-lift Neutron rocket. Rocket Lab says it continues to make progress in development, and a company spokesperson reiterated that timeline to the publication, saying, ""We’re still targeting to get Neutron on the pad before the end of the year."" That is all well and good, but it's perhaps worth remembering that SpaceX had its Falcon 9 rocket ""on the pad"" in January 2009 and did not launch for the first time until June 2010.

RKLB Share Price vs. Short Interest - Latest Update,"NASDAQ released the latest short interest in RKLB just a short while ago (dated 11/29/2024 when the SP was at the ATH of >$27).  Below is a graph showing plots of RKLB short interest (obtained from NASDAQ) overlaid with the corresponding day's share price (obtained from Fidelity) covering the previous 1 year and 15 days. The earnings call was the main driving force for the share price rocketing up.  Shorts were caught napping and they desperately had to scramble to cover their positions which probably drove the share price up even more to the new ATH of >$27. As a result, short interest decreased dramatically (\~20%) from the previous month. Short interest was still high at \~49.28 million shares short or \~13% of the float as of 11/29/2024. I think new shorts have since then opened new short positions (this is how shorts typically react after a massive price spike) and they’re heavily shorting the stock which is partially causing the downtrend in the share price.  The other reason for the downtrend in the share price is probably due to profit taking.  My thinking is that we will see share price consolidation in the $20 - 22 range at least in the near term.  What do y’all think?  Please share here.

To the Ones Sleeping on RKLB,"A few months ago I stumbled upon RKLB and it was hella low… but I never pulled the trigger. As of late it’s been moving and so naturally i’ve been looking into it more and more and wanted to get a feel for how it stacks up against the competition (This is just for people who are relatively new… very obvious info). Rocket Lab is up against companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and some smaller guys like Astra and Firefly Aerospace.
 
Obviously Musk is the big dawg of the commercial space sector, with a $210 billion valuation. They dominate the industry with cheap rideshare missions for small satellites, which is bad news for Rocket Lab since they’re targeting the same market. Pretty much…. SpaceX’s scale and success are the biggest threats to Rocket Lab, hands down…. especially with the funding they just pulled too.

Blue Origin, while worth around $12 billion because they have Bezos running the show, the company is absolute dogwater for now and 0 threat. They are yet to surpass a suborbital launch lmao.

Now, Astra and Firefly are smaller but focused on launching small satellites at low costs. They’re not doing as many launches as Rocket Lab, but they could be disruptive by offering cheaper alternatives in the future but for now it's nothing crazy.

One company in this whole commercial space industry that kinda made me pause was Virgins Orbit. To really understand Rocket Lab’s position, I started looking into Virgin Orbit’s story. Basically for some background, they were another promising company in the small satellite market, valued at around $200 million before going bankrupt in 2023. This got me thinking though… was Virgin Orbit ever worth more? Turns out, at its peak, Virgin Orbit was valued at around $3.7 billion because of the hype around their air-launch system.

That’s when I started to feel a little nervous. If Virgin Orbit, a company once worth billions, could go bankrupt, what about Rocket Lab? With a current valuation of $5.5 billion, it’s not that far off. Given how tough the space industry is (super high costs, tons of competition, substantial loss when things go bad, etc), it’s a fair question to ask if Rocket Lab could face a similar fate.

After digging deeper (GPT search is goated for this), I found some key reasons Rocket Lab is way more robust and unlikely to follow in Virgin Orbit’s footsteps:

* Unlike Virgin Orbit, which struggled with consistent operations and reliability, Rocket Lab has a proven record of successful launches. As of now, Rocket Lab has completed dozens of successful Electron launches, building customer confidence and expanding its market share. Looking at Virgin Orbit…. Basically they had only completed a handful of launches and faced way more technical issues. Rocket Lab's reliability in delivering payloads on time and at a competitive cost is a significant advantage over the difficulties Virgin Orbit experienced.  
* Rocket Lab is not solely dependent on launch services. It has successfully diversified into spacecraft design, satellite components, and satellite management services, which provide additional revenue streams. This strategic diversification helps mitigate the risks associated with relying solely on launch operations, which was one of Virgin Orbit’s weaknesses. Virgin Orbit primarily focused on air launch technology.  
* Rocket Lab has future projects like the development of the Neutron rocket, which will allow it to compete in the medium-lift launch market, giving it access to larger payloads and way more lucrative contracts. At this point… Virgin Orbit was still trying to establish itself in the smaller payload market when it encountered financial troubles (so they weren't even able to get past logistics). . Additionally, Rocket Lab has been working on reusability with Electron, which could further reduce costs and increase profitability over time, a significant factor that Virgin Orbit lacked.  
* Rocket Lab has raised significant capital and managed its finances well, with plans to grow its business strategically. Virgin Orbit, despite its initial $3.7 billion valuation, faced liquidity issues and struggled to raise funds, eventually leading to bankruptcy. Rocket Lab’s revenue has been growing steadily, and while it is not yet profitable, the company's long-term plans for increasing revenue through more launches, satellite services, and new rocket developments give it a clearer path to profitability than Virgin Orbit ever had.  
* The demand for small and medium satellite launches is growing due to the rise of satellite constellations for communications, earth observation, and defence. Rocket Lab is well positioned to capitalise on this, having established itself as a trusted provider. Virgin Orbit’s limited ability to scale and capture a significant portion of this growing market played a role in its downfall.

So yeah, while I had some initial concerns comparing Rocket Lab to Virgin Orbit’s downfall, it’s clear that Rocket Lab is in a much stronger spot

What many people miss about Rocket Lab,"I have seen a lot of posts on here and WSB that only discuss the launch side of Rocket Lab.

Rocket Lab is not just a launch company. They are way more than that. They are an end to end space company.

Take a look at these scenarios below.

Company X( basically all companies that need something in space to operate. Use ASTS for example): These companies design and build something that operates in space, but rely on another company to get their equipment there.

SpaceX: launch provider with an emphasis on launching their own constellation with further goals in space. We all know they can launch themselves.

Rocket Lab: started as a launch only company with Electron but have heavily diversified their business into space systems. Their business offers the ability to design, build, launch and operate a customers satellites or space craft or maybe their own constellation someday. This is why it is called end to end. Their business is not launch, launch is only one of their tools to more effectively do business in space. Neutron will not make or break this company. They do not rely in its success to make them profitable. They could stop development today and still be profitable in the future due to the way they have positioned themselves in the industry through their space system business segments. This type of position is going to be huge in the future as more people move their business into space.

I have followed this company for 3 years and they continue to impress me. Though launch is a very exciting part of this business, since it is really the only one we can see, I encourage every investor here to start viewing this company as an all around space company instead of just a launch company.

Rocket Lab to Supply Solar Power for US Space Force's New Missile Warning Satellites,"The solar cell assemblies will power three Lockheed Martin spacecraft designed to provide resilient space-based global missile warning capabilities to meet evolving threats from adversaries under the United States Space Force’s Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) program

&#x200B;

LONG BEACH, Calif. --(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Rocket Lab USA, Inc.  (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a leading launch and space systems company, announced that its high-efficiency, radiation-hardened Coverglass Interconnected solar Cell (CIC) assemblies will power the three Lockheed Martin Next Gen OPIR GEO (NGG) satellites for the United States Space Force (USSF). The NGG program will deliver resilient global missile warning capabilities to counter emerging missile and counter-space threats and is part of the latest evolution of the USSF’s missile warning system, following the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) program, which was supported by  SolAero , a space solar power company acquired by  Rocket Lab  in  January 2022 .

“We are excited to continue our long-term partnership with Lockheed Martin by powering the Next Gen OPIR GEO satellites,” said  Brad Clevenger , Rocket Lab’s Vice President & General Manager, Space Systems Power Solutions. “These satellites are critical to the mission needs of the United States Space Force and our national security, and we are proud to be supporting their production on an aggressive schedule.”

Rocket Lab’s CICs will be integrated into the solar panels and arrays on the Lockheed Martin-designed and built spacecraft. The spacecraft recently successfully passed critical design review, a major milestone in becoming certified for space. The first of the three satellites is scheduled to launch in 2025.

Founded in 1998 and acquired by  Rocket Lab  in  January 2022 ,  Albuquerque, New Mexico -based  SolAero  has produced solar cells, solar panels, and composite structural products for more than 1,000 successful space missions with 100% reliability. Over the past two decades, SolAero’s products have played key roles in some of the industry’s most ambitious space missions, including supplying power to NASA’s Parker Solar Probe, James Webb Space Telescope, and Mars Insight Lander, as well as several Cygnus Cargo Resupply Missions to the  International Space Station .

1. It happened with volume that was the highest is the last 3 months
2. A follow through on the following day with twice the volume.

I am trying to figure what's behind the move. Any inputs would be appreciated.

So far, the theories are

1. ""One man's loss is another man's gain"". United Launch Services is actively seeking buyers. Blue Origin had issues at their factory.
2. VK Services LLC, distributed about 14M shares to their Partners. This is also good news. Venture Capitalists don't give junk to their Partners

Is there a bear case?," While investing money (and probably generally in life) I think it's important to understand the other side's argument better than your opponent.   


So while recently on this sub we are seeing a lot of optimism, and even hype i'll try to write a few words about how it can go wrong. At least what I think can go wrong.   


**Neutron engine and timeline delays.** 

RKLB announced Neutron will be operational in 2024, just six quarters away. 

On investor day in september 2022 Peter Beck announced there will be a significant change to Neutron design, instead of relatively simple (by rocket science standards) gas generator engine Archimedes will be oxygen rich staged combustion - a much more complicated concept. And there will be 9 of them (not 7) on every rocket. 

Here you can watch Scott Manley commenting on the change:

https://youtu.be/4Ky3YzhRWko?t=414  


Complexity of engine design will be on par with BE-4 and Raptor. And those two took like a decade to build, and did not reach orbit yet. Here we have less than two years. Difficult if not impossible. 

**Money and cash flows**

If we assume Neutron development delays happen we have to look at the cash burn and possibility of future equity rise and dilution. 

Last few quarters look fine (september 22 was when Neutrone design change was announced so lets start Q3 2022): 

&#x200B;

|quarter|cash|burn rate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Q3 22|515||
|Q4 22|484,3|\-30,7|
|Q1 23| 450|\-34,3|

a steady spend of 30+M per quarter doesn't seem like a lot, and gives us lots of runway to profitability. While Q2 23 is not going to tell us much (virgin complex acquisition, and possible helicopter sale will distort the numbers) I think costs associated with building Neutron will be increasing quickly. We have a growing headcount and major work to be done before us, is very difficult to estimate what capex is necessary, but 500M for an innovative reusable rocket is not a lot. A year delay with 60M burn per quarter and we're out of funds.

Just look at what it took to build a simpler Falcon 9. (by the way this may be the best clip in aerospace history): 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvim4rsNHkQ  


**Summary:**

If things get delayed we may see dilution which may hurt the stock price temporarily, but overall even if 50-70M shares will be issued and sold at around 5$ impact should not be huge. 

If the company successfully delivers Neutron (and with Peter Beck at helm I see no reason why it would not) investment in Rocket lab can bring significant returns in a 5-7 years time frame. 

I just can't imagine successful space company with reuseble rockets and advance space systems being valued below 10B$

Also with the current geopolitical situation and China catching up in space development I don't believe the US government would ever let RKLB fail.

I didn't write anything on Electron and space systems, because I don't see any significant risks there. Mayby I'm wrong? 

Disc:

im long Rocketlab

i usually invest in cash flow positive companies that return cash to shareholders, RKLB is an exception. (I'm passionate about space and astronomy, follow the industry for  allmost  a decade and think they will succeed)

So what risks do you see? What can go wrong that we are missing? ",73,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/14ojut3/is_there_a_bear_case/

SpaceX Encourages Competition,"SpaceX’s President and COO encouraged competition in space, emphasizing that the market is enormous and that it’s unlikely SpaceX alone can service the entire market. Especially in space broadband, she described the opportunity as huge with room for plenty of competition. Basically, the tide is ready to lift all boats and they don’t see their construction of a luxury super yacht as holding anyone else back from getting rich in the new space economy…

On launch, it also appears they are willing to make trade offs in medium launch to capture the most profitable end of heavy launch in pursuit of their long term goals. That seems to leave the door wide open for Rocket Lab. Interesting comments:

“Starship is really a replacement. It obsoletes Falcon 9 and the Dragon capsule. Now, we’re not shutting down Falcon, we are not shutting down Dragon — we’ll be flying that for six to eight more years,” she said.

“But ultimately, people are going to want to fly on Starship: It’s bigger, it’s more comfortable, it will be less expensive,” Shotwell added.”",73,23,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/15/spacex-gwynne-shotwell-starlink-competition.html

Not saying we are going to lift off Monday, but I give it a year before share price doubles (9$ ish).

However, in the early stages in a new industry, big mistakes can be extremely costly.  In the case of Tesla, the focus on the cybertruck and electric semi’s has cost a fair amount of Cap ex and no revenue.  Cybertrucks are sitting on lots and in fields and if you follow the Reddit r/cyberstuck you can see that they are basically hot garbage.  Teslas were incredibly successful at first but the constant price decreases and increases have turned some people off from buying again.  On top of that, and more importantly, Musk himself has alienated his largest consumer base with his anti-California, anti-lgbtq, etc…nonsense.  If there is one thing most successful CEOs will say is keep your loyal customers happy.  Tesla’s share of EV sales has dropped from 75% in 2022 to just under 50% in 2024.  

But, this is about Rocket Lab.  Space companies are going to continue to rely on government contracts along with the private sector.  For U.S. contracts, the company has to be based in the U.S. and meet specific security requirements.  There are only a couple of companies that can do that.  Over the next decade, the space industry should see phenomenal growth.  One company will not provide all the services.  The contracts will be split between multiple companies.  When it comes time to award those contracts, ability and consistency will play a huge role and also reputation.  Beck has done a fantastic job of being politically neutral.  He just gets the job done.  Musk on the other hand has decided to back one horse whole-heartedly and there will be a price to pay for that.  If his candidate loses, along with the trepidation congress already feels about how much power and influence he already has, it could be an opportunity for Rocket Lab to grow with huge contracts.  They just have to get Neutron to be successful.  If Kuniper turns out to have better technology then Starlink and if ASTS technology takes market share since a lot of people just want their phone to work in remote areas and not carry around an entire dish, then that could slow Starlink growth.  Space X will continue to be successful due to Starship but they are not guaranteed the top spot forever now.  

Hang onto your stocks my friends.  It is going to be a wild ride into space in the years to come.   ",72,9,https://i.redd.it/ga8vuv0dvtid1.jpeg

Let's talk MSR and competing proposals...,"MSR. So hot right now. For better or worse, I wanted to share my opinions on the likelihood RKLB gets the MSR mission.

I realize we only have the abstracts for the proposals, but it should be enough to tell us who is taking this seriously. I'm honestly flabbergasted at some of the proposals, and I've attempted to summarize the abstracts even further below. You'll quickly see that it's a two, MAYBE three horse race... and RKLB is in it.

* Rocket Lab: ""We put a lot of effort into this proposal, and intend to show you just why we are the perfect choice. We can and have done nearly everything you're asking a company to do, we have a proven track record and a reliable path to mission success, and we can do it faster and cheaper than anyone else.""

* Lockheed Martin: ""Sure, we can do it for your max budget and.... sometime... before 2040. We have lots of experience with this stuff, dude. We've partnered with you before and we sure liked all the cash you filled our coffers with. Give us the contract and we will do the bare minimum to meet any of your needs. But we're pals, man! Like, our relationship goes WAY back... and don't forget the lobbying money we spend! So... can we have the money now? kthx""

* Blue Origin: ""So you're already building SLS and HLS, so...let's like... leverage those options, and then you won't even need to worry about how many samples you can return! *SLAPS 4 BILLION DOLLAR ROCKET* This baby can fit SO MANY mars samples inside of it!! We can't talk about schedule because uh.... that's kind of on you (wink wink) but uh.... we think by using these options you might be able to accelerate your schedule? But listen to THIS... we've got a couple of super brainy Ph.D.'s leading a ""team"" of EXPERTS looking into all of this, and they have a whole 50 years of combined experience on mars missions! So uh.... pick us, and then we might actually take any of this seriously.""

* Quantum Space: ""We develop spacecraft. Or.... I guess... we're trying to. We haven't had any success at all, but we're smart cookies who think outside the box!! We think we came up with a novel but quite difficult approach to trajectory and spacecraft needs by basically doing a lunar orbit rendezvous and hand off of the samples to another vessel before returning to Earth. Sure, we know you're probably going to call this bullshit, be we prefer to call it a ""disruptive concept"""".

* Aerojet Rocketdyne: ""We're smart cookies and we take this seriously. We've already identified areas where we can reduce the mass of the theoretical MAV and SRL, and that would allow us to use existing technologies to get the lander on the surface. We've been doing this a long time and have a lot of success, and we've already started to figure out which propulsion technologies would fit into a mission like this or which would need to develop further. We really want to use the skycrane to land the MAV, and will likely concentrate all efforts on that front since it would speed things up considerably. The reduced mass MAV and SRL will allow us to return plenty of samples.""

* Northrop Grumman: ""So we are like, quite competent in propulsion, and we've been doing this stuff for like, a really long time. We will do some uh.... engineering.... and uh, we want some government money so we can keep developing our solid rocket motors. And then you can use them for this mission!! :D""

* SpaceX: ""Uhh... we're already going to mars. We don't know when, but.... we can just pick up your samples for you while we're there, and then charge you a shit ton of money for the privilege :) Sit back and relax!""

* Whittinghill Aerospace: ""We're a cutting-edge tech firm out of the Midwest, awaiting imminent patent approval on the next generation of ~~radar detectors (D2D)~~ MON hybrid rocket motors that have both huge military and civilian applications. Now, right now John, our stock trades over the counter at $0.10.... but we..... oh shit.... wrong number.""


So, alright then. We have some serious proposals, and we have some jokers. I think there are a few that you can remove straight off the bat. Whittinghill and Quantum Space. One is an engineering company, and the other makes spacecraft. Lots of companys do both, these companies do just the one, and are both quite small and not in a position to handle such an important contract. That widles us down from 8 to 6.

This is where it gets a little tricky, since we don't know what's actually in the proposals... all we have are the abstracts. But taking things at face value, there are a few additional proposals that don't really seem to be taking it seriously, or don't really offer any value to NASA by choosing them. Those options are Lockheed, BO, and Northrop. Yes, THOSE BIG THREE. Why? Lockheed is basically ""max budget, max timeline"". What incentive does that provide? BO relies on SLS sticking around AND on HLS sticking around.... which kinda feels like a complication of.... the SpaceX option? And Northrop can just pound sand. Their abstract is one of the worst in the whole bunch outside of Whittinghil and Quantum IMO. 

So... that leaves THREE actual ""competitors"" IMO. Let's dig into those. Rocket Lab, SpaceX, and Aerojet Rocketdyne, so let's start with Rocketdyne. They've put in the effort here, and have the company heritage to execute on their claims. They want to leverage existing technologies, while developing their rocket motors further so they can reduce the weight of the MAV. Smart cookies here, but no real promise on a timeline. Just vague talks of being able to 'accelerate' the timeline if they CAN leverage the skycrane the way they want. Solid choice, reasonable value to NASA. I give this option a B+.

Now let's talk about SpaceX. It's not so much a 'proposal' for a 'mission' as it is like, ""Hey Jim, I'm running to the store anyways. Want me to bring you back anything? Oh...no... I'm not going now. I'm going in like... 5-9 years... or something?"". It's not a BAD proposal, but without knowing the financials it's hard to say how likely NASA would be to choose this option. They're relying on HLS anyways, so if Starship is gonna be a thing, this could make sense. But they lose a lot of control, and who knows if their proposal is for a $9B budget and a return date in 2038? They don't say, and I don't think NASA will like losing that much control and influence on the mission. I give this option a C-. Feasible, but probably not NASA's best actual choice, since it really strips them of their autonomy.

And finally.... Rocket Lab. They can do it for under $2B on a fixed-price contract WAY earlier than NASA's requirement of 2040. They've built spacecraft, sent spacecraft to the moon using multiple trajectory burns, they've engineered and built spacecraft busses, reaction wheels, solar panels, navigation and guidance systems, rocket engines and rockets themselves, and they've even returned a capsule to earth that had samples inside of it already. They can do the entire mission, end-to-end, for 18.1% of NASA's budget, and get the samples here almost a DECADE earlier than required. Even IF NASA choose RKLB and they didn't deliver as promised, NASA would have SO much damn cash left to pursue other avenues (and presumably, almost a decade to do it...) that it would seem almost criminal for them not to select the RKLB proposal. RKLB could fail and they'd still be likely to succeed ""Hey Elon... grab us some samples on your next 2038 Mars mission... here's $5B"". Cool. NASA still got the samples back before 2040 and for $7B. I give this proposal an A-. The only thing keeping me from an A or an A+ is that Neutron isn't flying yet.

So, those are my big three that have a chance, but I personally think it boils down to Rocket Lab and Aerojet Rocketdyne. SpaceX is going to mars anyways, and like I mentioned above, we could just pivot to having them bring us back some samples a decade from now if things don't otherwise work out. For that reason, I give the SpaceX proposal a 15% chance of being selected, the Rocketdyne proposal a 40% chance of being selected, and RKLB a 45% chance of being selected. I'm assuming all the proposals I 'eliminated' earlier have a 0% chance, but that's likely not true. However, I wanted to simplify this.

So, from my seat, RKLB is actually the MOST likely proposal to be selected for MSR? Why? Execution, cost, and timeline PLUS the ability to NASA to pivot to SpaceX in the 2030's if necessary. Rocketdyne a close second.

I'd love to hear what you guys think of my analysis. Happy turkey day!",72,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1h248x8/lets_talk_msr_and_competing_proposals/

First time RKLB has ever reported a net increase in Current Assets,"I'm sure a good amount of you caught this, but in all the excitement around record revenue/growth, the successful hot fire, the neutron infrastructure updates, etc, I missed something.

As far as I'm aware Rocket lab has never posted a quarterly net increase in total current assets **(obviously not counting the capital raise in February).**

Except they did last quarter. This really surprised me, I expected to see a similar quarter over quarter decrease typical to any quarter since the SPAC merger.

Total current assets as well as cash & equivalents + marketable securities combined are slightly higher this quarter than last.

Is this the start of a trend? I'm skeptical for now. CFO Adam Spice mentioned an increase in capex through the next 3-4 quarters tapering off in Q2 '25 as the first neutron launch approaches. That mixed with the lower expected launch revenue in Q3, I wouldn't be too surprised to see the downtrend resume, at least in the near term.

I still found this encouraging and thought it was worth a share.

I have done some analysis on potential acquisition targets, let me know if that's something you'd like to see, happy to share.

What Are Wall Street Analysts Missing in Rocket Lab's Growth Story? Mapping the Rocket Lab's global empire,"The BofA analyst was talking about the defense industry in the recent Yahoo Finance interview. When he was asked about Rocket Lab, the first and only thing that he discussed was the Neutron rocket. This further supports the point made in [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cvqs8a/what_are_wall_street_analysts_missing_in_rocket/) that analysts are overfocusing on Neutron and they're missing more than the 3/4 of the Rocket Lab's growth, which is in its space systems business. When someone asks me about Rocket Lab, I say that yeah, they got rockets, but the role of their rockets is to support their main business by enabling them to develop and test their components and software for spacecrafts in space on customers' money. Heritage of products is very important in space business.

To comprehend the scale of Rocket Lab's main business, it's necessary to know a thing about **Rocket Lab's facilities producing space systems products which amount to 78% of the current Rocket Lab's backlog, potentially as high as 90% as some future revenues have been kept away from the backlog, and also for 73% of the Q2 2024 revenue guidance.** Here's the list of all Rocket Lab's facilities:

1. Global HQ in Auckland, New Zealand
2. Rutherford assembly and test facility in Maramarua, New Zealand
3. Electron launch facility at Mahia, New Zealand
4. Ex-SailGP facility in Warkworth, New Zealand
5. Ex-Sinclair Interplanetary production facility in Toronto, Canada
6. Ex-SolAero Technologies facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA
7. Ex-Advanced Solutions, Inc. office in Littleton, Colorado, USA
8. Ex-Planetary Systems Corporation facility in Silver Spring, Maryland, USA
9. Ex-Lockheed Martin production facility in Middle River, Maryland, USA
10. Electron launch facility on Wallops Island, Virginia, USA
11. US HQ in Long Beach, California, USA
12. Ex-Virgin Orbit facility in Long Beach, California, USA
13. Rutherford engine test facilities in California, USA
14. Neutron production facility on Wallops Island, Virginia, USA
15. Neutron launch facility on Wallops Island, Virginia, USA
16. Archimedes test stand in Stennis Center, Mississippi, USA

In addition to mission control centers in Auckland and Long Beach, Rocket Lab has 2 further mission control centers. Rocket Lab also operates comm stations.

5 out of 16 (No. 5 to 9) are purely dedicated to the space systems segment, 3 (No. 14 to 16) are purely dedicated to Neutron, 3 (No. 4, 10 and 13) to Electron and the remaining 5 (No. 1, 2, 3, 11 and 12) facilities are a mix. Facilities below are those of which I am sure that they're supporting the booming space systems business.

**The Auckland HQ** is the global hub. It comprises the mission control, R&D and production facilities for both launch vehicles and spacecrafts including the high-volume reaction wheels production line.

**Long Beach** **HQ** facilities are the US hub. They have the mission control, R&D and production facilities for Photon sat bus and Rutherford and Archimedes engines, spacecraft components and spacecraft assembly.

**Sinclair** is the expanded R&D and production facility for spacecraft components such as star trackers, reaction wheels, laser crosslinks, electronics, etc.

**SolAero** is the R&D and production facility for solar cells, solar panels, electronics, etc..

**Advances Solutions** develops flight software and offers mission simulation, and Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) services.

**Planetary Systems Corporation** is the expanded R&D and production facility for separation systems and sat dispensers.

**Ex-Lockheed Martin's Middle River** facility produces advanced composite structures: ""*support the development and manufacture of carbon composite spacecraft buses, structural panels and assemblies, satellite dispensers, aerostructures and heat shields, composite overwrap pressure vessels, solar panel substrates, launch vehicle structures and more. The site will also play a role in the development and long-term supply of carbon composite structures for Rocket Lab’s new medium lift launch vehicle, Neutron.*""

Not listed is the **Johns Hopkins APL** which has been cooperating with Rocket Lab on commercializing ""*near and deep space capable small spacecraft telemetry and control radio technology*"".

These facilities have been further developing so my information may not up to date as they may have acquired additional functions.

To better appreciate the speed at which Rocket Lab moves and grows, let's go back to 2017:

* In 2017 Rocket Lab had some facilities in New Zealand - the HQ, Rutherford test and assembly facility and the launch facility. They also opened their first facility in Huntington Beach, California, USA.
* In 2018 Rocket Lab selected Wallops for Electron launches from the US soil.
* In 2020, Rocket Lab acquired Sinclair Interplanetary and moved their US facility from Huntington Beach to Long Beach.
* In 2021-23 they went on an acquisition spree: Advances Solutions Inc., Planetary Systems Corp., SolAero and SailGP have been all added during this time along with the most of their staff. They've also purchased the Ex-Virgin Orbit's rocket factory in Long Beach and the Ex-Lockheed Martin's facility in Middle River. They've also started building the high-volume production facility in the HQ. They have also started building Neutron production and launch facilities on Wallops Island. All of them have been successfully integrated into the Rocket Lab's global empire.
* In the meantime, Rocket Lab and the CEO have been supporting the grassroot space startups in New Zealand, which may be either acquired or they may cooperate with Rocket Lab down the line.

Further acquisitions are expected with cash raised in Feb 2024. One of my guesses is Novo Space (I give it a 10% chance).

The launch segment is an important enabler but it is not the main profit maker. It makes me wonder why are analysts so overfocused on Neutron or Electron/HASTE launches to the point that they're missing the Rocket Lab's main business.

Only one satellite has been booked and it is very large. When unfurled it will be 2400 sq ft.

They did not disclose who the launch provider is, but if you look at the provider names they did list, put in the time frame, you get one company left.

There it is, I could be wrong but I’m betting it’s RocketLab based on previous comments from the Spice about interest in the first launch.

Astra did that, and Virgin Orbit too, until they filed for Chapter 11.

**Ok, cool. What are Rocket Lab's competitive advantages over SpaceX and Blue Origin?**  
With Electron, smaller satellites that need to be launched sooner and to closer locations can be cheaper and more profitable over time compared to delays.

**Wait, why does their revenue recognition change so often over quarters?**  
Revenue for launches can only be recognized at launch, with 90% paid by launch day.

**How many launches are needed on Electron per year to be profitable?**  
Around 21.

**Wait, they didn’t launch that many per year.**  
First, consider revenue recognition. Delays are primarily on the client side.

**What is Neutron?**  
A significant new rocket that can lift up to 13 metric tons.

**How much does R&D for this cost?**  
It's supposed to be around $300 million. It might cost more.

**Wait, that’s a lot.**  
Yes, but relatively speaking, it's cheap. The Falcon 9 cost around $390 million in 2011.

**When will it launch?**  
Mid next year.

**How far along are they in development?**  
They've tested the engine.

**What about their other business activities?**  
Are they doing recovery?  
Soon.

**I’m glad you asked about satellites and space systems. These are high-revenue lines, profiting under SolAero and Sinclair, and selling carbon composites.**

**What do those do?**  
Star trackers, ion propulsion, solar panels, separation systems, and solar panels.

**How did they acquire these companies?**  
M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions).

**Wait, that’s like shopping for companies?**  
Yes, it's hinted that they may buy something for a new constellation.

**Who are their customers?**  
NASA, DOD, Space Force, and commercial customers.

**Wait, the financial statements say they’ve got convertible notes.**  
Yes, they have debt that can become shares.

**Great, are there any cons?**  
Yes.

**What are they?**  
Risk of a launch failure, delays in Neutron, and onerous legislation.

**Ok, what’s the ticker?**  
RKLB.

**Is there anything else?**  
Yes, I recommend reading *When the Heavens Went on Sale* and watching *Wild Wild Space*, which discusses Rocket Lab, Astra, Planet Labs, and Firefly.",71,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1ewizrn/faq_for_rklb_for_new_wsb_people_fixed_thanks/
Rocket Lab wins $515 million contract to build 18 satellites for U.S. government agency," 

WASHINGTON — Space launch provider and satellite manufacturer Rocket Lab has secured a deal worth over half a billion dollars to build 18 satellites for a U.S. government agency. 

As disclosed in an SEC regulatory filing Dec. 21, Rocket Lab National Security will “design, manufacture, deliver and operate 18 space vehicles” as part of a U.S. government contract valued at $515 million. A spokesperson said the company could not provide further details. 

Sources indicate that the customer is likely the Space Development Agency.

What percent of your portfolio is RKLB?,"With the recent run-up RKLB has increased to be roughly 6% of my portfolio. If it performs anywhere close to what we expect it to over the next decade it’ll be very difficult for me to invest enough elsewhere to keep at a reasonable level of my 30sh stock portfolio. And yes of course I want to buy more but want to keep a balanced portfolio. Will be a great problem to have but also pretty risky. I imagine some here have I higher allocation and am curious to hear your thoughts.

Exciting growth prospects in Australia,"I’m a space enthusiast from down under (NZ) who has been following Rocket Lab for a while. I want to discuss the new subsidiary company Rocket Lab Australia, which has not been mentioned often on this sub.

I think there are prospects for significant growth in the Australian space and hypersonic defence industry in the coming years. All in all, Rocket Lab is poised to become the launch capability leader in the Oceanic region by 2030.

The Australian Government is committed to pour funding into space and defence in the coming years. This could feasibly supply bread and butter contracts to keep Rocket Lab’s bottom line steady (and help fund Neutron).

The only other launch provider in Australia is Gilmour Space, a promising small company, have only launched small rockets. They are still well behind on Rocket Lab in proving launch capabilities, and are not going for vertical integration of space systems. The maiden flight of their first commercial orbital launch vehicle, called **Eris**, is planned for late 2024. This is planned to deliver a similar payload to Electron.

There are not many launch sites in Australia yet. It’s possible Rocket Lab would provide launches from New Zealand for Australian contracts or build their own launch facility there.

Here are some of the facts:

* Rocket Lab recently established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Rocket Lab Australia, with the purpose of exploring opportunities to support Australia's national space capabilities.
* HASTE, a suborbital launch vehicle derived from Rocket Lab's Electron rocket, was also recently announced. HASTE aims to advance hypersonic and suborbital system technology development through reliable, high-cadence flight test opportunities.

**Space sector and launch growth**

* The Australian Government has set a goal to triple the size of the Australian space sector from AUD$4 billion in 2016 to AUD$12 billion and create 20,000 additional jobs by 2030. They have already committed more than AUD$2 billion to the civil space sector since 2018, supporting various programs related to Earth Observation, satellite infrastructure, and high-tech manufacturing. (""the most significant investment ever made in Australia’s civil space sector."")
* The 2022-23 Budget includes funding of AUD$1.16 billion until 2038-39 and AUD$38.5 million per annum ongoing for the first phase of a National Space Mission for Earth Observation. This investment aims to make Australia more self-sufficient in critical Earth Observation data while fostering capability and job opportunities in the industry.
* Rocket Lab Australia has a head start over its competition in the region, most notably the fledgling launch provider Gilmour Space.

**Defense**

* The recent AUKUS security alliance between the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia is dedicated to developing hypersonic missiles. It’s possible these Governments will co-fund tests.
* The Australian Government’s defence public strategy targets acquiring approximately USD 190 billion in new defence systems by 2030.
* Of this, AUD$17 billion (USD$18.3) is allocated to the development of Defence space capabilities, to enhance existing space capabilities and develop new solutions domestically and internationally.

One downside to note is the Australian Government is funding a satellite manufacturing hub for larger earth observation satellites via a collaboration of companies. This is still in the early stages of being established. It’s possible there would not be much upside for Rocket Lab’s space systems division if the hub is successful. However, a collaborative hub possibly provides fewer opportunities for bespoke designs than a vertically integrated company.

Considering these facts, Rocket Lab seems in a favorable position to expand its presence in Australia.

Interested in others thoughts!

 “When  you think of Moon missions you think of the enormous Saturn V rockets  of the 1960s and billions of dollars, but we’re going to the same  destination with a carbon fibre rocket and our Photon spacecraft the  size of a bar fridge, all for just a fraction of that cost,” Beck says. 

 “As  technology continues to shrink and with each advance in aerospace  engineering, we can achieve so much with un-crewed missions like  Capstone. That saves time and money, making exploration much more  accessible.”

Confidential Customers?  Expect more of them and why I’m accumulating shares.,"First of all I screwed up buy reducing my shares after it gained 200%.  I was buying at $3.5 - $6 and after a healthy increase I sold some around $10.  I still have a good amount and I’m accumulating again and here is why…

This latest launch was by a “confidential customer” and the new contracts for neutron are also from a “confidential customer.”  I knew they would beat earnings since the new customer wasn’t factored into the earnings forecast during the Q3 presentation so I bought a bunch more and calls just before earnings.  Be prepared to see “confidential customer” a lot from Rocket Lab in the future.  A lot of developed countries, especially in Europe, do not see Trump as an ally and now that Leon is part of the government they want to distance themselves from him and SpaceX.  If Trump installs large tariffs then you can easily predict a trade war.  The faster these other countries get up their own internet satellite systems the better.  Not only do they not want to rely on Starlink for secure communications, they don’t want to rely on SpaceX to put up their satellites.  This is where Rocket Lab will be taking full advantage of having non-U.S. based launch facilities.  For those that have been here awhile there were rumors of Rocket Lab acquiring a constellation builder in the U.K.  I fully expect that to happen now to service their European and Asian customers and be fully integrated from build to launch.   I bet we get news of that before the 4th Quarter earnings in February.  Several people that are very Pro SpaceX / Leon  won’t read this far and you will see responses from them below calling this bullshit and how SpaceX is far and away the only real private company option for other countries….just watch.

My prediction is RKLB between $35 - $50 by the end of 2025 unless there is a black swan event.

Speculation Post. The “deep pocket” mega constellation customer hinted at is not Amazon. But rather Apple using Globalstar.,"I will leave these articles for everyone to make their own conclusions on this one.

“The space systems business — whose products include star trackers, reaction wheels, solar power systems, separation systems and more — also saw a massive growth in revenue, increasing by 239% year-over-year. To meet this growing demand, the company further announced last year that it was building out new manufacturing capabilities for reaction wheels, in particular.

The investment is paying off: It appears that Rocket Lab has landed a contract to provide reaction wheels to an unnamed mega constellation customer. The company said as much in a February press release announcing a new 12Nms reaction wheel product, saying that the wheel is “currently planned for flight with an undisclosed large mega constellation customer.”

Is RocketLab the black sheep of the space industry?,"Why does RocketLab barely gets a mention when people talk about Space and it's future?

It's always SpaceX, Astra (well maybe not now) Relativity, Firefly, RedWire etc etc and if course now Lunar, talking about the potential they have and how they will be the next big competitors delivering products into space. It seems every other company but RocketLab gets talked about, it's kinda like we are the black sheep in the space industry.

RocketLab is executing on their goals and hitting targets, it's hard to not see how RocketLab is going to be up there with SpaceX in the future and I'm confident with my long hold of 10k + shares which imo this stock will be at least around the $40 mark by 2030.

RKLB is already as cashflow positive as a disruptive juggernaut should be,"New Space is full of opportunities that Rocket Lab is continuously positioning itself to capitalize on. Once Neutron development costs fall, the company won’t just coast along focusing solely on profitability. Nor should it. A strategically disruptive venture like Rocket Lab will continue to invest, and as such continue to delay profitability for many years. While important for ensuring stability, cashflow positivity shouldn't be the sole or even primary focus. Other key metrics to consider to gauge Rocket Lab's ability to capitalize on opportunities, maintain financial health, and increase investors’ returns include:

**Growth-Focused Metrics**

* Overall Revenue Growth
* Mission Manifest and Scope
* Backlog Health
* Acquisitions and Strategic Alliances

**Operational Efficiency Metrics**

* Launch Cadence
* Project Costs
* Innovation Development Progress (Neutron, Constellation, etc.)

**Financial Health Beyond Cash Flow**

* Gross Margins
* Debt-to-Equity Ratio
* Burn Rate

**Strategic Considerations**

* Market Dynamics
* Regulatory Environment
* Competitive Landscape

While short-term investors may value cash flow positivity, long-term investors should view it as a warning sign that growth opportunities are waning or that strategic limitations are developing. Those playing the long game should consider these more holistic metrics that take into account Rocket Lab's long-term vision, as the company may well continue to be cashflow negative for years so long as strategic opportunities abound.",62,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1b0odf4/rklb_is_already_as_cashflow_positive_as_a/

Just thrilled that we finally have the technology / re-useability to truly start  Space travel / The  Space economy. No different than the railroad in my opinion. 

When starship makes it to Mars and the world realizes there's unlimited wealth in the asteroid belt.... Every government will create / shift funds to space. Book it. This is one we will all look back at and wished we had purchased more... 

Exciting times.... I'm more excited for my kids. Our smart phones will be VHS for them. Space travel to the moon and modular space stations will become a normal thing / air bnb's/ cruises in space. The TAM can't even be imagined. Yes, that might be after our time, but it will be our generation and companies like RKLB that will provide the infrastructure to make that happen. 

I've never been more excited as an investor, but more so as a human being. It's taken thousands of years to get here and we get to be a part of it.

Stop tellin Bull*** to others,"Hi guys,

&#x200B;

I was an active observer of the market since I was investing in SPCE. Now I am holding 5060 shares in RKLB and lost much money in call options. My opinion is still only subjective view of the cold-bloded psychopath - so take it to the account haha

&#x200B;

Many of you are saying that:

\- the stock is going to crash

\- Beck is not gonna sell or will sell a lot

\- we are dead because of the insiders selling

&#x200B;

1. The stock performance in comparison to the others is doing very very good. We are still around 10 $ when the others are in 2-6 USD... (I mean space SPAC's) The current price is established by the negative sentiment not the bad fundamentals which are not the same, are better in objective way. Is that stock overvalued? In some sense yes in some no - yes because using normal analysis profit/price it is totally overvalued, but if we look at potential growth it is totally undervalued - Look at professional analysis, the cut was done from 20->15 during the market hammering, still 50% to go up.
2. You are all wrong, because for sure insiders will sell - this is TOTALLY NORMAL and it would be very very strange that Beck and others will keep their 100% stake without selling antyhing. FYI Beck is not an stock investor who is thinking that this is gonna moon in 3 years so I will be holding ALL the stock for the 3 yers... c'mon would you hold all of your stake in his position? And honestly this is completely normal.
3. Insiders selling is present for ALL the stock companies so whats the point? Is it changing fundamentals? Nothing at all... So hold your horses guys.

&#x200B;

If you are in dept, having financial problems or just mental problems seeing stock value decline - than stock market is not for you. If you look at this as fundaental investment with great revenue perspectives and a real bumpy ride - than you can buy now more shares :) Take care for all of you guys!",62,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/s9bgi6/stop_tellin_bull_to_others/

Valuation ,"I keep seeing comments that RKLB is cheap and SpaceX is overvalued. Or other commentary that sounds like it is based on faith and not thought out metrics. Full disclosure I'm bullish on both. 

Morgan Stanley has probably one of the most publicly available in-depth analysis of SpaceX value. They note that 60% of the value is in Starlink. That would make SpaceX rocket side about a $75B valuation. Given their launch revenue was estimated to be $5.5B for 2024 that is a revenue multiplier of 13.6x. Apply that to Rocket lab and you get a valuation of $10b on $245m of revenue and you have a revenue multiplier of 40.8x. 

RocketLab's launch business is three times more expensive to buy than SpaceX's right now. Not sure SpaceX is overvalued (on launch).  Starship is arguably a much bigger leap than Neutron (new model vs providing a launch alternative to existing model). So, not sure how SpaceX can be called overvalued and at the same time saying RocketLab has room for another 150% gain ($50 share).

If this is correct (and it was quick and sort price analysis), does RKLB benefit from IPO access and demand for the sector that cannot be easily accessed via SpaceX? Is there something else driving the multiplier difference? Yes both companies do more than launch, but one has turned that into revenue while the other is just starting down that path. And that portion of the valuation is pulled out of SpaceX in the above analysis and assumed to be $0 for RKLB. 

Maybe that's the difference. That the market is already valuing the non-launch business at even more astronomical multipliers than SpaceX's non-launch business.",59,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1gs6fmx/valuation/
Anyone here holding LUNR and RDW aswell as RKLB?,"I’ve finally pulled the trigger and put some money in the space stocks, and I’ve gone for RKLB, LUNR and RDW, with RKLB being the biggest holding of the 3.

My train of thought was, the more these companies grow and develop, get more cash behind them, capture more share of the growing space market etc, that these 3 combined will be absolutely raking the contracts in. RKLB for launch and end to end space services, Redwire for development and construction of higher end speciality space tech (their space 3d printing will be a huge bread winner imo, and then all their general high quality infrastructure like their solar cells, robotic arms, cameras, sensors, RF transmitters, in space manufacturing, their space greenhouses etc), and LUNR could/will be the go to company for getting your things on to the moon surface which is essential and they’re one of the only ones offering actual payload delivery to the moon surface (can’t see many commercial avenues for this currently but now space is more accessible than ever, I predict that america will want to have some amount of control over the moon surface, before China gets there first, I’d imagine establishing moon dominance will become a bit of a strategic/geopolitical thing)

Obviously this is all wildly speculative and a very, very high risk play. But in the long run (im thinking 15 years +), if these 3 are still around by that point, they’ll be space giants and there’ll always be one of the three receiving a contract for something. Obviously spacex will be hoovering up contracts too, but I still think that in the long term, these 3 will be consistentently winning more and more contracts and are probably positioned to be giants in the market when it inevitably consolidates.

I know this isn’t necessarily strictly rocket lab stock related, but this seemed like the best place I could think of to get a discussion going about this!",58,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1foekgj/anyone_here_holding_lunr_and_rdw_aswell_as_rklb/

A revelation I’ve come to realise,"One of the biggest unknowns we’ve had about Neutrons commercial success, is how well it will actually compete with Falcon 9. I for example, have always been hopeful, but a bit unsure about the fact that Neutron can only put 13 Tons into LEO in reusable configuration, compared to a much higher offering from Falcon 9.

Until the penny dropped that Falcon 9 is a mature design that’s been in production and service for well over a decade, and has seen many iterations and evolutions over it’s life.

I searched it up, Falcon 9s first ever iteration “v1.0” could only put 9 tonnes into LEO, and it wasn’t reusable. The second iteration “v1.1” could put 13 tonnes into LEO, and wasn’t reusable. It wasn’t until v1.2 came about in 2015 that it could then put 18.5 tons into LEO in reusable configuration and 22.8 Tons into LEO as an expendable rocket. It then later got refined into its next iteration “Block 5”, but it’s payload capacity stayed the same, and the en you’ve got Falcon Heavy which obviously has the higher capacities again.

So when you compare this to Neutron, it’s starting out brilliantly already. Considering Neutron is a foetus and Falcon 9 is a fully matured vehicle by now, and even so, F9 in its current state can only put 5.5 more tons into orbit than Neutron can (with both in LEO reusable configuration respectively). 

It’s safe to assume that as Neutron and Archimedes go through the development process and receive updates/iterations as it goes through its life and matures, that Neutron will be a very strong contender to Falcon 9. I mean, we already know that Archimedes in it’s current stage of life, will be operated at pretty low stress levels. And even at low stress levels, it’s starting considerably further ahead than where Falcon 9 started its life. Over the years of neutron being in service, when Rocket Lab refine and improve on their base design of neutron, when they learn more about Archimedes and how far they can push it whilst still being reliable to launch again and again and again, it seems safe to assume that Neutrons payload capacity will see decent payload improvements.

But my main point to realise is that Neutron is starting its life, leaps and bounds ahead of where Falcon 9 started its life, in terms of payload capacity and the fact that it will be reusable right from the outset. Obviously, this isn’t all down to Peter Beck masterclass, it’s been over a decade since F9 came to life, and technology has moved on since then. Still though, with this in mind, I feel a lot more confident about the argument of “How will Neutron compete with Falcon 9”. 

Will we see a neutron heavy? I doubt it but I’d love to be proven wrong in 5-10 years time. But with this in mind, not even taking into account that certain clients may pick rocket lab purely because it’s the only option that isn’t Elon Musk, AND the fact that Rocket Lab will offer end to end space services unlike SpaceX, AND the fact that Rocket Lab missions are tailored to their customers better and have a more precise orbit insertion, I think it’s pretty reasonable to assume that Neutron will at the very least, give Falcon 9 a good run for their money. 

The only thing that does still worry me slightly is that Falcon 9 has more than paid off for it’s self by now, so SpaceX will be able to price gouge/undercut Rocket Lab as much as they want (within reason), and Rocket Lab can only lower their prices so far to match it, after all, they have years of neutron service ahead of them to pay off the development costs.",59,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fttb0l/a_revelation_ive_come_to_realise/
Huge component of the business not yet factored into share price,"I wanted to point out something that others have mentioned before, particularly Vince is Bullish:

Peter Beck has said more than once that Rocket Lab is aiming to launch 50% of their rockets for customers and 50% of their rockets for themselves. This is because one of the primary purposes of their business is to create some sort of space infrastructure akin to SpaceX’s Starlink - some type of constellation that provides a service with high value for customers and high profit margins for Rocket Lab.

SpaceX’s valuation ballooned (almost doubled) to $200B since Starlink has come online.

When ASTS simply mentioned their constellation contract with AT&T, their market cap 10x’d in 3 months (before they had put anything into space).

Rocket Lab is fully vertically integrated (ASTS had to use a SpaceX rocket to get their first 5 satellites for AT&T into orbit). Once Rocket Lab is ready to begin building their own constellation, they’ll be able to do it at significantly lower cost than ASTS.

The only reason Rocket Lab’s price hasn’t moved on these repeated announcements of Peter Beck’s 50/50 plan for the company is that they haven’t announced exactly what their constellation will be yet.

But anyone that knows this company can pretty safely assume it’ll be a success that drives huge profits.

Remember, ASTS moved 10x on news of a constellation. Rocket Lab has announced a constellation too but there’s been zero movement (recent movement is due to other reasons like Neutron progress and price upgrades).

Once they announce the purpose of their constellation and provide a roadmap with more details, the stock could easily 2-5x in a handful of months. This will almost certainly occur simultaneously with the first successful flight of neutron or shortly after (6-12 months).

Long-term PT's? A discussion about the future value of RKLB,"Last month, according to Bloomberg, SpaceX was valued at $150 billion. As of today, Rocket Lab is valued at $3.7 billion. I thought this thread could be used for  discussion of Rocket Lab's potential future value, specifically long-term value (5-10 years). Assuming the float remains as it is, a value of $37 billion for example would put as at $78, 10x todays value. I believe if the company stays on the right path for many years, this is very realistic long-term. Where do people think this company and stock will be in 5-10 years?

Personally, my PT for the stock, which I plan to hold onto until at least 2028, is $150. This would give the company a valuation of around $70 billion which seems reasonable to me - bearing in mind that if we compare it to SpaceX, I do believe that SpaceX will also be worth a lot more than it's current $150 billion valuation in 5-10 years.",60,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1541hnq/longterm_pts_a_discussion_about_the_future_value/
RKLB next TSLA?,"Sounds crazy but there’s no SpaceX public stock to invest in. 

I think there is going to be mergers or consolidation in the space industry at some point and RKLB positioning itself either to be a leader in LEO rockets OR it’ll be consolidated with ULA because Lockheed and Boeing don’t want to bank on SpaceX

Alternatively, Amazon is likely to get involved as BlueOrigin is faltering. 

I know it sounds to good to be true, but it can quickly scale engines and satellites to other companies as a side-business and already has the ITAR/EAR approval between the US/CAN/AUS/NZL so that’s big for defense applications. 

The CEO is also a personality which is slowly beginning his rise without getting attacked by Elon. 

The only way I see this stock going down is because banks and ppl dump it quick for profits.",57,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/14yn5hw/rklb_next_tsla/

Rocket Lab pushing for first Neutron launch in 2024," 

Rocket Lab says it could launch its first Neutron rocket before the end of the year as it outlines a long-term vision for the company that involves its own satellite constellation.

In a Feb. 27 earnings call to discuss the company’s fourth quarter and 2023 financial results, Rocket Lab executives said development of its Neutron medium-lift reusable rocket was on schedule and budget, with a goal of a first launch before the end of the year.

“Right now, we have a schedule that closes for a launch by the end of the year,” Peter Beck, chief executive of Rocket Lab, said of Neutron. “But, we’ve got a lot of testing to get through.”

Question,"I live in Korea and in Korean sites, a number of people are concerned about RKLB because Trump said he will appoint Elon as ‘government efficiency commission’ if he becomes president.

Basically, they are worried because according to them(Koreans) Peter allegedly said that Elon is trying to suppress competitors like Rocket Lab in this field and that he is interfering w RKLB’s foothold in the industry by doing things such as lowering the launch price of the small-mounted vehicles etc.

As a result, Koreans w RKLB stocks are concerned about Trump being president since if Elon Musk takes up the government position, there is a very high possibility that he will use legal methods to push Spacex and suppress the competitions like Rocket Lab (according to them).

I want to ask if this is substantiated or just over-speculation/conspiracy by Koreans since I haven’t seen people in this Sub talk about this(or maybe you guys did and I didn’t see it).

Idk a lot of Koreans seem to be focusing on how to debate would affect the stock market, especially with Tesla and Elon related stocks and I’m curious if it’s a reasonable thing to do.",56,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fe7pcs/question/

"RKLB - Price Targets, Fair Value & Margin of Safety","I recently [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/t4ysvx/rklb_fair_value_dcf_analysis/) a fair value DCF for RKLB, as projected by Simply Wall St. After reading the comments, I wanted to clear something up:

**Fair Value ≠ Price Target**

*The fair value generated by a DCF is not the same thing as a price target issued by an analyst.*

A target price estimates how much other investors are willing to pay for a the stock, in something like 12 months. I think of it as a short term weather forecast for the stock price.

Let's take a look at the price targets for RKLB, which you can find on [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKLB).

**Analyst Price Targets**

|Date|Analyst|Price Target|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Feb-23-22|ROTH Capital|$20|
|Jan-12-22|Morgan Stanley|$17|
|Nov-30-21|BofA Securities|$20|
|Sep-30-21|Stifel|$22|
|Sep-17-21|Deutsche Bank|$18|
|Sep-13-21|Cowen|$18|

These price targets tell us nothing of the assumptions used to arrive at them, or the time frame over which the analyst is estimating. If your horizon is 12 months, then I suppose they might be useful.

The DCF Fair Value, or Intrinsic Value, is the gold standard for determining how much an investment is worth - based on a number of assumptions. It generates a fair value, but also states the assumptions used to arrive at that figure.

Using Simply Wall St's example as a starting point, I've created by own DCF for RKLB - with assumptions that personally I am comfortable with.

**My Discounted Cash Flow**

|Metric|Value|
|:-|:-|
|Risk-Free Rate|3.00%|
|Equity Risk Premium|4.47%|
|Industry Levered Beta|1.077 |
|Discount Rate|7.81%|
|Levered FCF 2031 ($M)|1,069|
|Total Present Value ($M)|13,148|
|Shares Outstanding (M)|449|
|Fair Value Share Price ($)|29.28|
|Current Share Price ($)|9.05|
|Margin of Safety|69%|

**My Assumptions**

I have assumed a 'Risk-Free Rate' of 3%, even though US Government Bonds are currently yielding about 1.9%. This is because I have an expectation that yields are going to rise to something like their pre-pandemic levels. I personally can't see them going higher than this because of the vast levels of government debt. I think in spite of inflation, the Fed are going to have to keep a lid on interest rates.

For the 'Equity Risk Premium', I have assumed the [forward price to earnings](https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_pe_ratio_forward_estimate) of the S&P, expressed as a yield (1/PE). Being brutally honest, I think the outlook for stocks is not great with valuations so high across the market - but I wanted to be cautious here.

I have deviated from Simply Wall St on the 'Industry Levered Beta'. I have used their same calculation, which takes into account RKLB's low Debt to Market Equity - but I'm not convinced by their underlying unlevered value for the Aerospace & Defense industry. I have used the value for the industry [here](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/Betas.html). But I am confident that Aerospace & Defense is the right benchmark.

Since yesterday, SWS have updated the free cash flow projections for RKLB. So I have used those new values. The values feel right to me, resulting in a 'Levered FCF 2031' of circa $1.1B. Looking at the total addressable market, the projected growth of the industry, the direction of the company, and the execution of the team - I think this achievable. But make your own judgements.

**Margin of Safety**

With my assumptions, I arrive at a 'Total Present Value' of $13.1B, and a 'Fair Value Share Price' of $29.28. But let's be careful about what this means.

*The value of $29.28 is not a price target. It needs to be viewed in the context of 'Margin of Safety'.*

Based on my assumptions and at a share price of $29.28, I believe RKLB is likely to deliver a return equal to my 'Discount Rate' of 7.81%.

Would I buy at $29.28? No! I want a margin of safety.

By applying a margin of safety, I can still expect to make a decent return even if things go wrong. Like the company delivers a fraction of the free cash flow, or the risk-free rate climbs higher than I expected.

**TLDR** \- At a current share price of $9.05, I see a margin of safety of 69% - which I am certainly comfortable with. I'd be pretty comfortable investing at a share price of anything up to about $20. But this must be a personal decision made by each investor.

This is my opinion based on assumptions I am comfortable with. Price targets don't interest me, I'm not a short-term speculator. I care about long-term intrinsic value and DCF is the goal standard tool for assessing that.

*At the time of writing, my main equal-weight space holdings are: RKLB, RDW, VLD. My speculative small holdings are: PL, ASTS, ASTR, SPCE, BKSY.*

*I am not a financial advisor, just some ape on Reddit, please make your own judgements.*

Starting Unicorns: Is Peter Beck Smarter Than Elon Musk?," 

Peter Beck has built Rocket Lab from an idea to a publicly held billion-dollar company. Rocket Lab, which was started in New Zealand and is now headquartered in Los Angeles, launches rockets, and just received a [$515 million contract](https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-wins-515-million-contract-to-build-18-satellites-for-u-s-government-agency/) from the U.S. government.

Here are the 5 Unicorn-Entrepreneurship strategies Peter Beck used to [launch Rocket Lab](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-15/spacex-rival-rocket-lab-resumes-launches-after-september-failure). These strategies are common to 94% of billion-dollar entrepreneurs (Truth About VC at [www.dileeprao.com](http://www.dileeprao.com/)).

Bought More RKLB 1/21 On Opportunity + Company Observations,"A reader suggested that I move this over to the main board after asking some questions. I am adding some additional information with links from my 1/21 post in the Daily Discussion Thread:

I bought much more Rocket Lab  today (1/21). I believe were are **nearing** a bottom - the S&P Short-term oscillator was -4 yesterday (1/20), and it should be -5 at least today. That's the buy signal for the oscillator and me, however, the market has been known stagnate. The oscillator does not drive the market it is a result of the market. It is an indicator of overbought/oversold conditions.

Today was also a major options expiry. Options are now the big game over the stock plays. This observation is supported in a link.  If you know about programmed trading and ""Max Pain"" theory then you'll know the enormous incentive to push down stocks into expiry and have most of them expire worthless. January is the biggest play followed by July and third Fridays of the month. Stocks usually bounce up 2-3 days later after settlement date. Of course, Fed move anxieties (inflation, interest rates) are presently the core down driver with options expiry exacerbating this. Given all that and being in correction territory for some indices I started buying more.

These are not the fundamental bases for me buying Rocket Lab. I buy stocks based on their leadership, culture and potential. I identify Peter Beck as a great and honest leader. He has built something remarkable. I detect the same with Adam Spice the CFO.

You can see some important underlying qualities in leadership when they are under pressure. Look how Peter Beck behaves when they lose a mission - apologies, sincerity and honesty. Honesty like the 'eating his hat' display. I had some email exchanges with Adam Spice the CFO and also he is running Investor Relations. That is one busy man and when I did not get a sufficient answer to an inquiry I had made I gave him a difficult reply. He made a a respectful recovery with more effort and I was impressed. I told him so and ended up with an invite to tour the Rocket Lab facilities in Long Beach. These are a few qualities that lead up to producing a great and prolific company culture.

My background is Aerospace (USAF pilot, NASA programs) and running corporations. The way Rocket Lab is approaching space expansion and their business model I think is the best. Will their be problems and learning curves - certainly. Aerospace is difficult - atmospheric ops are hard and space is even harder.

I have been actively investing and trading for 35 years. When you see companies making a turn around like GE under Larry Culp you can observe qualities in their leadership and experiences. I bought GE at $5 ($40 after the reverse split) and that investment turned out productive.  I see similar qualities in leadership at Rocket Lab. So that's what I am really buying given the opportunity the market is providing. For me RKLB is an investment, not a trade. I am long-term and patient.

It was clear to me the program trading on RKLB Friday (1/21) was a mirror to the indices. The DOW, NAS and S&P were in sync that day as in the day before. I did see what appeared to be support in the last minutes to finish RKLB at 9 with increasing bid and ask to hold it there, and it did. That was planned. 

So I picked up 4K more. If we go up I'm happy, if it goes down I'll consider buying more and bring my average down.  Leadership, culture and a good business model gives vision the best chance. The market brings opportunity. Good luck to everyone.

Updates: The S&P Short-term oscillator was at -6 on 1/21 at market close.

Billionaire Ken Fisher Pours Money Into These 2 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks - RKLB,"In the world of stock legends, Ken Fisher stands out. The legendary investor founded his private financial advisory firm, Fisher Investments, in 1979, with just $250 in seed money. Today, Fisher’s company manages over $195 billion in total assets, and his personal net work exceeds $5 billion.

Fisher has cast his eye on current market conditions. In recent published note, Fisher points out the obvious headwinds in the current environment: “Fear of the impact of the tragic, grinding war in Ukraine and hot overseas inflation. Fear of the ‘tightening’ at central banks across the world hurting China’s export demand. And prolonged Covid restrictions in Shanghai and Beijing. All this and more has torpedoed global sentiment thus far this year.”

It's a dark picture, true. But Fisher also sees hope ahead for investors, and that hope is part and parcel of the very pressures that investors are facing. He writes, “Beneath the sour surface lurk powerful positives... Their stealthy presence amid widespread gloom upends global recession fears and provides evidence that brighter days are ahead…” He describes the current conditions as ""exactly the kind of broad pessimism that new bull markets are born in.""

Turning to Fisher for inspiration, we took a closer look at two stocks Fisher's firm made moves on recently. Using TipRanks’ database to find out what the analyst community has to say, we learned that each ticker boasts a “Strong Buy” consensus rating from the analyst community and massive upside potential.

\[Here is the Rocket Lab USA portion\]

Rocket Lab USA (RKLB)

From e-commerce we’ll move over to space flight. While Elon Musk’s SpaceX has hogged the headlines in the private venture space industry, it’s far from the only game in town. Rocket Lab is a space-launch company with a reusable small launch vehicle, the Electron, capable of inserting 300kg payloads into low Earth orbit. The Electron rocket is the only reusable small launch vehicle currently in service, and is in high demand – Rocket Labs has made 26 successful launches since introducing it, and deployed 146 satellites.

Rocket Lab is working to expand the launch options available to customers with the development of the Neutron launch vehicle. The Neutron, when complete, will operate in the 8-ton payload class, and will be able to launch cargos capable of leaving Earth orbit altogether. The US Space Force last year awarded Rocket Lab a $24 million contract for development work on the upper stage of the Neutron vehicle.

In addition to its launch vehicle, Rocket Lab offers customers access to the Photon spacecraft, a small-size configurable vehicle launched as the upper stage of an Electron rocket. The Photon can be optimized for low- and mid-altitude Earth orbits, geosynchronous orbits, or even extra-Earth flights to the Moon or the nearby planets Mars and Venus. There are currently 2 Photon spacecraft orbiting Earth. In late May, Rocket Lab announced that its customer Varda Space Industries, which had previously ordered 3 Photon spacecraft, had increased its order to 4.

Also in May, Rocket Lab announced that the CAPSTONE spacecraft, a joint operation undertaken on contract with NASA, had been delivered to its New Zealand launch facility. Rocket Lab will now begin integrating CAPSTONE with the launch vehicle, as part of a long-duration NASA mission to the Moon.

This space launch company has proved of interest to Fisher, who recently bought up 538,913 shares of RKLB. His stake in the company is worth $2.62 million at current share prices.

Rocket Lab has also caught the attention of Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu, who writes: “In our view, the company’s growth and margins across various business lines are set to inflect over the next year and its new larger Neutron rocket will be fully sold out for at least 2-3 years even before its maiden voyage. Moreover, we think its Space Systems segment remains unappreciated despite winning the landmark Globalstar/MDA contract which surprised many legacy competitors.""

""Looking ahead, the stock may be volatile due to tactical factors (growth sell-off, shift in shareholder base, etc…) but we think the enormous disconnect in valuation will likely compress relative to SpaceX which in the private market was reportedly seeking a $127bn valuation just a few days ago (RKLB now trading at only \~$2bn),"" the analyst added.

Yu brings a Buy rating for the stock along with his comments, and his price target here, at $14 per share, suggests \~189% upside for the year ahead.

His Wall Street peers are also upbeat on the prospects for Rocket Lab, as shown by the 4 to 1 breakdown in analyst reviews, favoring Buys over Holds and supporting a Strong Buy consensus view. The shares are selling for $4.86 and the $14.10 average price target implies a high 191% upside this year. (See RKLB stock forecast on TipRanks)

Rocket Lab's tech is extremely valuable,"With interest rates rising, any company that's not immediately profitable or has a high P/E has its valuation questioned. Rocket Lab is no exception. One of the things that gives me confidence in Rocket Lab is the strong leadership and management. Another one is the diversification beyond just launch services. But I think it's also important to realize that Rocket Lab's tech is extremely valuable.

Rocket Lab is not a software company. The technology stack that they own and what they've perfected is not easily replicated by anyone anywhere. It took them 16 years to get where they are today. They have the ability to launch payloads into orbit. This is an ability that many sovereign nations don't even have (but wish they did) and it's extremely valuable. Not just for communication satellites, but also because of its military potential. Rocket Lab can launch spy satellites, and if things were to really go south, Electron could be turned into an ICBM.

With satellite mega-constallations soon on the horizon, we have a situation where right now, Starlink is kicking everyone's ass. They're way ahead of everybody else in this race. I don't think that Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and all of the big telecom players are going to want to let this play out. I think it hasn't fully dawned on them yet, but soon enough, they're going to realize how bad of a position they're in. The realization might start to hit them around the time that Starlink starts opening up registrations to the broader public. There's going to be a rush into space tech investments, and Rocket Lab will be at the top of the list. Google or Amazon could easily invest a billion or two or four into the company. They might even try to buy them outright (which I hope they don't agree to), but either way, I think it's extremely unlikely this decade that Rocket Lab could ever go bankrupt or have any difficulty finding investors. I also think it's unlikely that the market cap could dip much below where it is for long, because everyone is going to want a piece of that space pie.

There’s more to Rocket Lab than Neutron,"There’s a continuous stream of questions about Neutron development and how much it’ll affect both the stock price and Rocket Lab’s overall success. Today’s consensus seems to tilt toward the narrative that the lack of announced Neutron progress is holding the stock price down. I think that that’s correct. However the relative impact Neutron has will likely shift as conditions evolve. Non-Neutron related developments that might impact the company’s success include:

* Space Systems wins a >$1 billion government contract (or two, or three, …) 
* M & A activities (mergers & acquisitions)
* New vertical product lines or horizontal core capabilities
* Significant revenue increases (>75% YOY) and the benefits that come with scale
* Key hires of “magicians” with track records of pulling rabbits out of a hat
* Wildly successful missions

Neutron will remain important until that line of launch capabilities is retired a decade or two into the future. But it’s important to appreciate that that’s not the only thing that will influence Rocket Lab’s success in the short to medium term. There’s much more going on at Rocket Lab than Neutron.",49,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1ap0urg/theres_more_to_rocket_lab_than_neutron/

$RKLB eligible to bid for NASA's TROPICS mission launch service (After Astra failed in 2022),"[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-maintains-contractual-relationship-with-astra-presses-forward-with-tropics-mission](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-maintains-contractual-relationship-with-astra-presses-forward-with-tropics-mission)  


Recognizing the urgent science needs, NASA is adjusting its launch services plan to complete the timely launch of a CubeSat constellation designed to improve understanding of tropical cyclones.

The agency’s Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats ([TROPICS](https://weather.msfc.nasa.gov/tropics/)) mission launch service now will be competed under the agency’s Venture-Class Acquisition of Dedicated and Rideshare ([VADR](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/12-companies-to-provide-venture-class-launch-services-for-nasa)) IDIQ contract targeting the 2023 hurricane season.

NASA and Astra also have agreed to modify its existing launch services contract, originally planned for the agency’s TROPICS constellation, for the launch of comparable scientific payloads on Astra’s Rocket 4.0 in the future.

NASA [selected](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-launch-service-contract-for-tropics-mission-to-study-storm-processes) commercial partner Astra in 2021 to provide launch services for TROPICS across three launches using the company’s Rocket 3.3 launch vehicle. On June 12, 2022, after a nominal first-stage flight, the upper stage of Astra’s Rocket 3.3 shut down early and failed to deliver the first two TROPICS CubeSats to orbit. NASA currently is participating in the launch investigation, led by Astra and the Federal Aviation Administration.

Following the first TROPICS launch attempt, Astra and NASA engaged in discussions regarding the remaining launch attempts. Astra then notified NASA of its intent to discontinue its Rocket 3.3 and indicated the company would potentially not resume launches prior to the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season. The VADR contract allows the 13 companies [selected this year](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/13-companies-to-provide-venture-class-launch-services-for-nasa) to compete for the rebid of the TROPICS launch services, giving the agency and external stakeholders the ability to use TROPICS data sooner.

TROPICS is an Earth venture mission – science-driven, competitively selected, low-cost missions that provide opportunity for investment in innovative Earth science to enhance our capability to better understand the current state of the Earth system and to enable continual improvement in the prediction of future changes. NASA is committed to helping grow the U.S. commercial launch market while enabling the agency’s science missions. The VADR contract allows NASA to nurture the emerging commercial market by awarding launch providers more risk-tolerant payloads such as TROPICS.

Did you know you bought into a conglomerate? A look into Rocket Lab and it's subsidiaries.,"As soon as you bought into VACQ, or RKLB, you bought into a micro aerospace conglomerate. It's small, with some fresh acquisitions, but it has room to grow. As soon as Rocket Lab acquired Sinclair Interplanetary back in March/April of 2020 it began it's transition to a conglomerate. Then it solidified that when they acquired three more companies. I've been researching those companies and think I know how they'll help. This started the other day when I was thinking if there was anything to the different amounts paid for the acquisitions[not just total but characteristics as well]. I don't have any definitive answer to that still, but found out more about how one of them may point to some answers.

On paper Solaero was the most at 80million dollars, that's the most recent acquisition and it still needs to be finalized. Planetary Systems Corporation was next at 42M +1.72M shares, so around 60 million(they also had 2022 and '23 bonus possibilities). Advanced Solutions, Inc. was next at 40 million with a possible 5million extra based on their own 2021 fiscal results. I don't know what they paid for Sinclair, Rocket Lab wasn't a publicly traded company and the details were not disclosed. They're all subsidiaries that continue to operate as they did before, completing their prior contracts. But now Rocket Lab gets to utilize them.

Starting with Sinclair Interplanetary a satellite component company. That acquisition was almost complete in March 2020 when covid hit, I'm glad neither of them backed out of the deal. Sinclair Interplanetary(Ontario) makes satellite components such as tourque rods, star trackers, and reaction wheels. A few months ago Rocket Lab announced the expansion of their reaction wheel production to a target of 2000 a year. I'll get back to that later. Currently SI has components on many different satellites, some of which are clients of RL. Blacksky for example. I assume photon will be using a lot of their components so that's how Sinclair will help in the future.

Advanced Solutions, Inc.(Colorado) is a flight software company. They provide a range of software to help plan and execute your mission. They're a little hard for me to understand everything they do. They have products on some interesting current and upcoming missions[OsirisREx and the Orion Capsule]. The thing I think they'll help with early is the Neutron return to launch site landing. Beck mentioned targeting being the part they have a concern will be difficult, so I think that's a major reason they acquired them. That and constellation management. 

Planetary Systems Corporation(Maryland) is a satellite separation company. They build components for a handful of launch provides including Space X. Each satellite needs to be detached or dispensed from the upper stage of the rocket. On the Rocketlab website you can find their flight heritage, including some Cygnus missions. I was hopefull they used them for satge separation of the capsule, but it looks like they use the capsule as a bus and distributed satellites. I still think they'll be advisors on the Neutron hung stage separation. Anyone have thoughts on PSC and why they're the only company that took shares, also they have the better looking bonus, almost 1 million more shares depending on 2022 and 2023 results. 

Solaero Technologies(New Mexico) is a aerospace solar panel company, one of the two major US companies. Spectrolab, under Boeing, is the other one. Solero has a large group of facilities in Albuquerque. They make many types of solar panels, some of which are on the James Webb Space Telescope. They have some experience with composites which may benefit Rocket Lab. They can also produce enough to supply constellations, which makes one of their major clients very interesting. [This](https://spacenews.com/after-bankruptcy-onewebs-supply-chain-looking-for-new-ways-to-keep-busy/) article is about OneWeb, another company like Starlink that is trying to establish high speed internet in low earth orbit.

 Before you read it let me give you some more background. First the article is almost two years old. Currently OneWeb is well past the halfway point of getting their **initial** constellation completed with 394 satellites in orbit and only 1 of them failing. They launch with the Soyuz rocket up to a higher than average altitude. They are up 1200km where they are higher than the majority of other spacecraft already in orbit, as well as debris. What looks like a red flag may have a silver lining. They filed for bankruptcy during March 2020, claiming covid as the main cause. From there the government of the United Kingdom stepped in to bail them out and are now one of their owners. Then a Billionaire who started one of the largest conglomerates that serves India and parts of Africa also bought in. Sunil Bharti Mittal owns around 40% of OneWeb, and is in a position to serve India 1.3B population and Nigeria the seventh most populated country at 200M. As well as other countries in the region. Eutelsat has a 20% stake, and as the name implies they have Europe covered. The company recently opened an assembly plant right by the Cape on Merritt Island. They are trying to get to a assembly rate of 2 satellites a day. That's where Solaero is sending its panel's to be put on a unit. Which gets shipped to Russia then placed in Orbit. 

**Does any of this matter past the solar panels?**

It might not. Although I do think the reaction wheel ramp up may be significant. **I'm not implying Rocket Lab is merging or signing some exclusive partnership with them, I'm just saying they can be a growing component supplier to Onewebs line of  satellites**. When you read the article it sounds like they have star trackers covered so forget those. I checked PSC's heritage and they've never sold anything to them from what I can tell. Could they use some John's Hopkins University radios on them? Maybe not now but on the next generation satellites? 

This [article ](https://solaerotech.com/solaero-technologies-powers-onewebs-satellite-constellation/) is from 10 months ago, it just shows Onewebs relationship with Solaero.

[Here's the SpaceNews archive on Oneweb](https://spacenews.com/tag/oneweb/)some good reading material positive and negative. Proposed mega constellation going from 46,000 to just 6,000. Or the 200 million they're getting from the Saudi government. 

They launch out of Russia and Kazakhstan. Those two are having problems but I just saw it's cooling off. I could see them wanting to move away from using them and buying some Neutron launches.

There was that news recently about India telling Starlink to stop selling units without a license. One more thing I thought was odd was of the list of companies applying for FCC approved satellites. Astra had 13000, and Rocket Lab wasn't on the list.

If at the end of the day they just have a large order of reaction wheels to go with the solar panels to keep them busy the next 2-3 years while they develop Neutron. Well then I couldn't ask for more than that.

I have optimism that once the Solaero deal is finalized we'll hear more details about what they have planned in the near term. When talking about the reaction wheels, I think I remember Beck commenting that they aren't just building them for the fun of it, they have clients lined up.",52,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/s3ny6o/did_you_know_you_bought_into_a_conglomerate_a/

We are coming off a consolidation phase and a gap up occurred today. From a technicals point of view,

1. There was a shooting star candlestick pattern on 10/24. Stock dipped by about 15% from a high of 12.09 to a low $10.16 on 10/31.  After this it crossed $13.
2. No major catalysts during this period. 
3. MACD's are crossing over and turning positive

The setup is incredible going into the earnings. I love this uptrend and I am betting that SPB has some great news to share on the earnings call. IMO, There are people seeing ""A secular trend"" and that's the driver for this momentum.  I mentioned this in my previous post. Other than that, I have no inside information.

PS: To newbie options players. This is not the best time to sell CC's. Option buyers, the premiums are just too high. Nov15 $17 1254 contracts were traded for $0.12. That's ridiculous. Don't throw away your money. **Sometimes, you miss the boat. Accept it. Don't chase it. Buy shares instead.**

The Key to the RKLB SolAero Success: Rocket Lab unveils space solar cell with 33.3% efficiency,"&#x200B;

[ The IMM-β is also a radiation-hard cell.  ](https://preview.redd.it/3qp8lmnbdz691.jpg?width=1060&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7806480f3f96b415c2158a399d5a923858e1d79d)

The new device is based on an inverted metamorphic multi-junction (IMM) cell technology developed by Rocket Lab’s unit Solaero. The cell can be used in applications in the civil, military, and commercial space markets.

**MARCH 10, 2022** [**EMILIANO BELLINI**](https://www.pv-magazine.com/author/emilianobellini/)   
 

US-based aerospace manufacturer and small satellite launch service provider [Rocket Lab USA Inc](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/16/us-aerospace-manufacturer-rocket-lab-takes-over-space-solar-cell-maker-solaero/) has presented a new space-grade solar cell based on a cell technology developed by space solar cell maker [Solaero](https://www.pv-magazine.com/press-releases/solaero-technologies-to-work-with-johns-hopkins-university-applied-physics-laboratory-on-aerovironment-puma-solar-wing-production-design/), which it acquired in December.

The new product, dubbed IMM-β, is an evolution of Solaero's inverted metamorphic multi-junction (IMM) solar cell, based on indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) and developed by scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/09/nrel-scientists-test-back-contact-architecture-on-perovskite-solar-cells/) (NREL).

“The IMM-β solar cell is expected to be the highest-efficiency space solar cell technology in high-volume production,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The cell boasts an average 33.3% beginning of life (BOL) efficiency, up from 32% for the IMM-α that is currently in volume production.”

According to Solaero's website, the IMM-α solar cell has a thickness of 150μm and a mass of 49mg/cm2, which represents a 42% reduction as compared to conventional multi-junction, space-grade solar cells.

The new cell can be used in applications in the civil, military and commercial space markets. “The IMM-β is also a radiation-hard cell with a power remaining factor of 87% after exposure to 1-MeV electrons at a fluence of 1E15 e/cm2 or equivalent of about 15 years life,” Rocket Lab stated. “Now undergoing final space qualification testing, the cells are expected to be ready for commercial use later in 2022.” 

“In partnership with our colleagues at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), we’re not only commercializing the world’s highest efficiency and lightest weight space solar cell, we’re doing so at the most competitive cost of any IMM technology to date. IMM-β's impact on solar array and launch mass will make it a compelling option for satellite integrators,” said Solaero CEO Brad Clevenger.

Solaero operates an 11,000m² manufacturing facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where it produces different kinds of space solar cells.

These include a 30%-efficient four-junction device on a germanium substrate; a 30.2%-efficient triple-junction solar cell optimized for low earth orbit (LEO) applications; a 29.5%-efficient, standard triple-junction cell based on indium gallium phosphide (InGaP), indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) and germanium (Ge); a 29.4%-efficient triple-junction device based on a germanium substrate; and the above-mentioned IMM-α cell, with an efficiency of 32%.

Mars Sample Return Mission Abstract - Rocket Lab's (former NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory) Richard French,"Everyone here has heard about the NASA Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission for which Rocket Lab is carrying out a study, which may lead to a NASA contract for either a full mission or some parts thereof. 

Let's take a look at Richard French, the Rocket Lab's man who is mentioned in the MSR studies abstracts of selected proposals published by NASA. Mr. French was mentioned in the Rocket Lab's news article of 2024/09/05 as a decorated NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) lead system engineer who, among other achievements, helped land the Curiosity Rover on Mars:, before moving to a managerial role at NASA HQ and later JPL's STO:

>Rocket Lab, the global leader in dedicated small satellite launch, has appointed Richard French to the role of Director – Global Government Launch Services. Joining Rocket Lab **following 12 years at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)**, Mr. French’s new role will see him focus on providing launch and on-orbit solutions for United States civil space customers such as NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as international civil space customers.

>In his previous role at NASA JPL, **Mr. French spent several years as an engineer working across various missions**, including the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission (for which he won the **NASA Honors Early Career Public Achievement Medal** for his work as **a lead system engineer**) **and** **helping to land the Curiosity Rover on Mars**. After moving into **a managerial role in the Space Technology Mission Directorate at NASA HQ, and then JPL’s Space Technology Office**, he made significant contributions in implementing public-private partnerships with companies like Blue Origin, Astrobotic Technology, and Made in Space, and helped stand up NASA’s first start-up accelerator program with Techstars.

>(...)

>“Richard’s extensive experience at NASA and his work on commercial and government partnerships made him the obvious choice to lead government services at Rocket Lab,” says Lars Hoffman, Senior Vice President – Global Launch Services. “Rocket Lab is proud to offer frequent, reliable, and streamlined launch services to small satellite operators, and I’m looking forward to seeing Richard expand on Rocket Lab’s premium experience for our government customers.”

>Mr. French says: “I’m excited for the opportunity to continue enabling government agency space missions, but this time from the industry side and with the leading dedicated small satellite launch provider. I’m looking forward to building on the already impressive capabilities of Rocket Lab for government missions and working with government agencies to better support the expansion of commercial space.”

Everyday Astronaut video about New Glenn,"This post is actually about Rocket Lab & Neutron, not a Blue Origin advertisement.

I really highly recommend watching Everyday Astronaut’s latest YouTube video with Jeff Bezos & New Glenn Factory. It confirmed three things I’ve personally thought are Rocket Labs clear advantages with Neutron.

1. Carbon composite gives you best performance and is clearly the best material choice. Downside to this is iterating the rocket design is not realistic so you have to get it right with the first design. Rocket Lab already did exactly this with Electron.

2. Reusable fairings attached to the 1st stage are an excellent idea to reduce cost.

3. If you can make the 2nd stage cheap enough, you will never have to deal with the problems that a reusable 2nd stage will have. Blue Origin is also attempting this. They’re (in parallel) designing a reusable 2nd stage and another ”as cheap as possible” expendable 2nd stage. Bezos said if they can make the expendable 2nd stage very cheap, then it doesn’t make economical sense to attempt to reuse it. 

What are these 2nd stage problems I mentioned? Look at what Starship has to deal with on re-entry. Combine that with the extra weight of the stainless steel, fuel, heat shielding that is required to make it reusable. That’s weight that could be used to deliver extra payload to orbit. (I know I know, Starship is designed for interplanetary travel etc. so re-entry is a requirement)

Rocket Lab is purely going for a 2nd stage that is as cheap and as light as possible. I think this will prove to be the right choice. There’s a lot of reasons why and are mostly related to economics and performance of the overall vehicle.

For example the empty weight for the 2nd stage of a Falcon 9 is 3900kg. Peter Beck has stated the 2nd stage of Neutron is roughly the same weight as a Harley Davidson motorcycle so around 300-400kg. That’s a big difference.

After watching the video I have a lot more respect for Jeff Bezos & Blue Origin. On a related note, Blue Origin is scheduled to launch two spacecraft built by Rocket Lab to Mars next month (unless there’s a delay)",49,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1eufya5/everyday_astronaut_video_about_new_glenn/

Taking everything into account… will hold until neutron is launched,"… at the very least.

There just doesn’t seem to be a reason to be nervous in RKLB. They are transparent, smart and moving at a solid pace with enough money to last a while. 

The demand for space tech will really kick in when there are breakthroughs in profitable manufacturing/research that can only be done in low gravity, space exploration that needs constant support or a bit further down the line mining. The first two seem within reach in the next few years and the later, will need to happen… just hard to predict when. In the meantime plenty of satellites to practice with. 

For that reason I’m holding roughly 75% of my holding and making it extremely hard for the budget seekers to grab my shares in this lovely company.

Sorry for the randomness.

RKLB - Fair Value DCF Analysis,"In my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/t4cd4b/i_think_simply_wall_st_have_this_right/), I shared the valuation of Rocket Lab as calculated by Simply Wall St. That valuation put the fair of the value share price at $38.16. Which implies the stock currently trades at a discount of 75%. Nice if true right?

Let's take a look at the detail. so that we can interrogate the assumptions. Simply Wall St have selected a '2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity' Discounted Cash Flow analysis (DCF). This is a widely accepted tool to value growth companies.

For those not familiar with a DCF, here's a quick primer. A DCF values a company by estimating the future *free cash flow* generated by the company over its entire lifetime - the so called *future value*.

Free cash flow is basically the money the company will have left to pay its shareholders after paying all its bills. It might pay that money to shareholders in the form of dividends or share buybacks.

But we must take into account the time value of money - that is, money now, is worth more than money in the future. Because money you have now can be invested and generate a return. Therefore, we must *discount* the future value of cash flows to their current value - the *present value*.

The discount rate used by Simply Wall St

|Discount Rate||
|:-|:-|
|Risk-Free Rate|1.92%|
|Equity Risk Premium|4.24%|
|Industry Levered Beta|0.927|
|**Discount Rate**|**5.85%**|

The 'Risk-Free Rate' is the rate of return you could achieve by simply holding risk-free US Government Bonds to maturity.

The 'Equity Risk Premium' is the extra return you should receive for holding a risky asset like a stock. SWS have used the risk premium of the S&P Global as the value here.

The 'Industry Levered Beta' is a measure of the risk within the Aerospace & Defense industry. A lower value is considered less risky than a higher value.

The formula for the discount rate is then:

    Discount Rate = Risk-Free Rate + (Industry Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)

Therefore, we have a discount rate of 5.85%. This is the annual rate by which we must discount future cash flows. I find it helpful to think of this as being the rate of return you might achieve if you bought the stock at the fair value as calculated by the DCF.

Looking now to the future value, SWS splits this into 2 stages. The 1st stage assumes the company grows substantially for the next 10 years, based on analyst estimates. The 2nd stage assumes that the company grows in perpetuity at the risk-free rate.

Future & Present Value of next 10 years

|1st Stage|Free Cash Flow ($M)|Present Value ($M)|Source|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2022|\-67|\-63|Analyst x2|
|2023|\-55|\-49|Analyst x1|
|2024|64|54|Analyst x2|
|2025|111|88|Analyst x1|
|2026|268|202|Analyst x1|
|2027|413|293|Est @ 53.96%|
|2028|571|383|Est @ 38.35%|
|2029|727|462|Est @ 27.42%|
|2030|871|522|Est @ 19.77%|
|2031|997|565|Est @ 14.42%|
|TOTAL|3,900|2,457||

Here we see that SWS estimates Rocket Lab's free cash flow over the next ten years to be $3.9B (future value). Remember, that's the money the company will have left over after paying all its bills. It's a measure of profitability.

We discount the future value by 5.85%, to work out how much that money is worth now. The present value of 1st stage future cash flows is therefore circa $2.5B. Money in the future, is worth less than money now.

The 2nd stage of the DCF assumes that the company will grow cash flows at the risk-free rate in perpetuity to arrive at the *terminal value* (the future value of the 2nd stage). Which is again discounted to the present value.

Future & Present Value of subsequent years

|2nd Stage|Terminal Value ($M)|Present Value ($M)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Stable Growth in Perpetuity|25,849|14,639|

There are widely accepted formulas to calculate these values, where growth (g) = risk-free rate.

    Terminal Value = FCF(2031) * (1 + g) / (Discount Rate - g)
    Terminal Value = 997 * (1 + 1.92%) / (5.85% - 1.92%)
    
    Present Value = Terminal Value / (1 + Discount Rate)^10
    Present Value = 25,849 / (1 + 5.85%)^10

Here we see that the future value of the second stage is estimated at $25.8B, which is discounted to a present value of $14.6B.

Then we sum the present value of both stages, to arrive at a fair value share price

|Valuation||
|:-|:-|
|Total Present Value ($M)|17,096|
|Shares Outstanding (M)|449|
|Fair Value Per Share ($)|38.08|
|Current Share Price ($)|9.10|
|Current Discount to Fair Value|76.1%|

**Assumptions**

This analysis estimates that the future value of all free cash flow generated by Rocket Lab over its entire lifetime at $29.7B. The present value of that cash flow is estimated at $17.1B.

The main variables in this analysis are the risk-free rate, the equity risk premium, and of course the estimates of free cash flows for the next ten years. Particularly the value of FCF for 2031, because this is used directly to calculate the terminal value - which is by far the largest element of the valuation.

The risk-free rate is based on the yield from US Government Bonds. An increase in bond yields will lead to a higher discount rate. This makes sense because you could get a better return without taking risk. So, the present value of future cash flows would decrease, and so would the fair value of the stock. This is why rising bond yields put such downward pressure on growth stock valuations - as we have seen recently.

Similarly, an increase in the equity risk premium would cause the fair value to fall. This might happen if investors become more bearish on stocks in general, such as during times of global uncertainty.

**TLDR** \- By far the biggest influence on the fair value, are the estimates of free cash flow for the next 10 years. Particularly the value in 2031. Whether you are confident in this valuation really comes down to whether or not you can see Rocket Lab generating a free cash flow of circa $1B in 2031.

**If you disagree with the valuation, which part of the analysis do you challenge and why?**

*My values deviate slightly from those stated by Simply Wall St, because I have recalculated the values in Excel and there are some slight rounding errors because they don't provide the numbers to sufficient decimal places to perfectly recreate their analysis.*",51,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/t4ysvx/rklb_fair_value_dcf_analysis/

Its a great company but is it a good stock?,"I love the progress Rocket Lab and strongly believe in Peter beck. But at current valuation is it a good stock?

Sure based on past pricing $4 is a good price. But at absolute level, will it give enough return for the underlying risk of investing in a pre-profit company. Let me make a reasonable bullish calculation, assuming how RKLB would be priced if was a net profit optimized growing company

As per their [SPAC ppt](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/assets/Rocket-Lab-Investor-Presentation.pdf), they are expecting to reach revenue of $1.57 billion by quarter ending Feb 2028.

I know RKLB is now focusing more on revenue than profit, so let me borrow profit margin from LMT (9.55%, 5y avg), NOC (11.66, 5y avg) (which are mature, so I believe would be reasonable margin RKLB would strive to achieve). Assuming profit margin of 12% and revenue of $1.57bil. It brings net profit to $188 million.  Lets slap a imaginary PE of 30, since they would still be growing. So the Market Cap comes to 5.6 billion (assuming no dilution). Assuming 5% dilution, Market cap comes to 5.3 billion at Feb 2028.

This gives CAGR at the higher end of 20s. While this is good returns, I feel there are lot of bullish assumptions baked into valuation. I feel investing in some stock like Google feels a better bet, interms of risk reward ratio. For a potential CAGR of 20%, does the risk worth it, when there is a possibility of bankruptcy ( even though I feel its impossible when beck is around, but still I feel this should be taken into account).

Unless beck comes with awesome space application idea after Neutron, I don't know if we would go above 10 billion Market cap

What do you think of my argument? I am new to investing and didn't know how else to value a pre profit company. Let me know your thoughts

Rocket Lab to launch hypersonic test vehicle for the Defense Innovation Unit The suborbital payload is a scramjet-powered vehicle made by the Australian firm Hypersonix," 

Rocket Lab announced a new mission for its suborbital launch vehicle — a 3D-printed hypersonic drone built by Australia’s Hypersonix for the U.S. Defense Department. 

The mission, projected for early 2025, is funded by DoD’s Defense Innovation Unit. DIU, based in Silicon Valley, works with  commercial space companies to help fill military technology needs. The suborbital mission awarded to Rocket Lab is part of DIU’s HyCat project, short for hypersonic and high-cadence testing capabilities.

Neutron capsule,"Peter Beck, Rocket Lab founder and CEO, says: “This mission was a phenomenal feat and impressive display of teamwork between the Rocket Lab and Varda teams to develop a unique and highly capable spacecraft, successfully demonstrate in-space manufacturing, and bring back the capsule and finished pharmaceutical product – all on the first attempt. Being part of the first pharmaceutical in-space mission to happen outside of the International Space Station is immensely exciting and we look forward to building on this success with more Rocket Lab spacecraft in development for Varda right now. The success of this reentry mission will also inform our work on developing a reentry capsule for Neutron to potentially enable human spaceflight missions.”

Only the strong survive… the great SPAC attack of 2019,"The year is 2019… 

Virgin Galactic merges with SCH to create SPCE, ushering in a new age of retail space investing…

Virgin Galactic, rooted in the genius of legendary aerospace designer Burt Rutan and Scaled Composites, becomes a public company via Richard Branson…

Virgin Galactic promises a bright future for future space tourists and investors. 

Branson would later take small satellite launcher, Virgin Orbit (VORB), public via merger with NextGen Acquisition Corp. 

Virgin Orbit wants it all. 

On September 25, 2020… Vector Acquisition Corp goes public. 

On August 25, 2021,… a young, fledgling space startup company founded by rocket bike connoisseur, New Zealander, gold-prospector, and cabbage patch look-alike, Peter Beck, merges with VACQ.

Rocket Lab enters the commercial space race as a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ. But legacy space and defense contractors dismiss RocketLab’s Electron rocket as too small for doing serious rocketry. 

It is early 2023…

After a global pandemic and nuclear winter for raising capital, the shakeout is in full swing. Space launch startups like Astra, Relativity, and Branson’s Virgin Orbit are teetering on the brink.  Claims of large 2B backlogs and realities of horizontal flying rockets will not save them from impending doom. 

On April 4, 2023, Branson’s Virgin Orbit files for bankruptcy, crushing hopes of a free satellite launching future not dominated by old school contractors and the SpaceX monopoly. 

The demand for satellite constellations and real-time global connectivity grows. 

It is June 20th 2024…

Rocket Lab successfully launches its 50th Electron mission, the fastest rocket to do so. Rocket Lab is also in full swing developing its medium lift Neutron rocket. 

It is August, 2024…

The archimedes engine breathes fire. People are skeptical of Neutron’s new engine, calling bullshit on Peter Beck for not releasing a long video of a hot fire.   

However, Peter Beck confirms a hot fire later in the month.  

The industry is put on check.

It is November 12, 2024…

In the Q3 earnings call, Peter Beck confirms Neutron is open for business. The first Neutron contract for a constellation operator has been confirmed. 

Will the future of affordable access to space and constellation building be dominated purely by the Falcon 9, Starship, Elon, and SpaceX????? ",45,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1gqxoqp/only_the_strong_survive_the_great_spac_attack_of/

BlueOrigin: less than 10 days to produce 1 engine,"BlueOrigin CEO:  
  
“We’d like to \[be delivering\] about an engine a week by the end of the year. I’m not sure we’ll get exactly to a week, but it’ll be sub-10 days … \[and\] by the end of 2025, we have to be faster than that,” Limp said.

Tbh. that news is shocking. BlueOrigin spend billions of dollars and years of development (development started in 2011, was announced in 2014, first launch in January 2024) and right now they need 10 days to produce 1 engine?  
RocketLab started development of Archimedes in 2021, as a ox rich cycle in September 2022.  
We won't come by exact production numbers, but my educated guess is that they are currently producing about 1 engine per month.

In the Q2 earnings presentation they wrote that engine 2 were coming off the production line. 5 more were in production. And as Peter Beck wrote in context with the recent Archimedes video, engine number 3 already should fix the copper issue.

The mission, called ‘Changes In Latitudes, Changes In Attitudes’, will launch to space from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 during a launch window that opens October 19^(th) for a confidential commercial customer. The expedited mission will be Rocket Lab’s fastest turnaround to date: from signed contract to launch date in less than two months.

>The mission will be Rocket Lab’s 12^(th) launch of 2024, increasing the Company’s record number of Electron launches achieved annually since orbital launch services began in 2018. Rocket Lab has achieved a 100% increase in its Electron launch rate for the first half of this year compared with the same time in 2023, doubling its rocket production and launch cadence within a year.

Will RKLB's share price double this year? - Revisiting my post from 2024/04/29,"My old post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cfjtco/will_rklbs_share_price_double_this_year/) and I'll re-post its text below. RLKB closed that day at $3.80. Today, it closed at $5.33.

My thesis was that RKLB has doubled from lows each year since its SPAC IPO and that 2024 will be no different in this regard. I've bet on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil. - this holds true at the current valuation.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06). - this was true and we're now expecting much higher Q2 revenues (+30% QoQ) and another doubling of the backlog.
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars. - this still holds true, the demand for Electron was confirmed by the Synspective's order of 10 Electron launches and app. 7 HASTE launches between 2024 and 2025.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year. - Neutron will not launch this year but Kuiper satellites are still scheduled for the launch in the second half of this year.

My thesis is still intact. Even though it is too early to do the victory lap, RKLB is now mere 30% away from doubling since its all time lows and there are many catalysts on the horizon. For example, the upcoming Archie hot-fire test (I love that Archimedes' nickname), Ashlee Vance's Wild Wild Space documentary on HBO MAX, the common run up to the earnings report and, of course, the FOMC cutting the rates this year.

Let me know your opinion.

[My post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cfjtco/will_rklbs_share_price_double_this_year/) from 2024/04/29:

RKLB share price has a history of doubling from its low during the summer and then falling down to repeat the process next year. So far, it has happened every and each year since its listing on the stock market:

* **2021: $9.5 to $21.34 from 2021/08/27 to 2021/09/09**
* **2022: $3.53 to $7.15 from 2022/06/30 to 2022/08/12**
* **2023:** **$3.76 to $8.05 from 2023/05/09 to 2023/07/19**

The 2024 low has been reached on 2024/4/16 at $3.47. What has changed from previous years besides the company's increased performance is that **the reported short interest YTD has increased by 161% from 22m to 58m shorted shares**. This huge increase right before the summer may cause a bound of a violent volatility once the 2024 doubling commences.

RKLB trades so cheaply and it is so heavily shorted that all that may be needed to revalue its stock is a shift in sentiment. Right now the stock is pricing in the most bearish of bearish outcomes. Delayed Neutron development, increased R&D costs and Electron's obsolescence. But Rocket Lab is the only space company dedicated to being a one stop shop for space applications. Suppose over this year, the management can craft a narrative that Neutron is really coming this year/early next year and with it a significant decrease in R&D costs and the growth and capture of launch and space system markets. Such sentiment shift may take time but I don't know, there are so many unusual factors with Rocket Lab that I could see it happening rapidly.

I am not betting that Rocket Lab is going to stage the most epic growth of all time. I am just betting on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06).
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year.

I am curious to hear your takes on Rocket Lab so we can compare our line of thinking.",42,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1e107fg/will_rklbs_share_price_double_this_year/
SDA Gamma Satellite Awards,"Important event upcoming for Rocket Lab. The SDA is expected to announce the winners of the Tranche 2 Transportation Layer Gamma satellites by August 8. Credit to Tim on twitter for pointing this out. https://x.com/Tim_X94/status/1808787582022467769

August 8 is also RKLB earnings call date, but I wouldn’t read too much into that. The Aug 8th date on the SDA contract was last updated in March.

The big $515m contract that RL won early this year was for 18 T2TL Beta satellites. I believe this was the smallest of the Beta satellite awards.

The Alpha satellites were awarded to York Space and Northrop Grumman. I don’t think RKLB was in a position to compete for these at the time.

The Beta satellites were originally awarded to Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. The Rocket Lab award was added on later.

There are only 20 Gamma satellites, and SDA apparently plans to award them to just one company. I doubt they would go with a new company, since the Gamma sats are apparently similar to Alpha and especially Beta satellites. So no real speculation here, other than that Rocket Lab for sure competed for these, and is one of 4 options SDA would likely choose. We should find out in the next month of they won.",41,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1dw08f0/sda_gamma_satellite_awards/
Space Systems business likely challenged by Rocket Lab's low stock price,"Some investors are thrilled that they can still buy Rocket Lab shares at a low price. However, there are significant downsides to such low share prices. The purchasing of businesses making other crucial satellite components could meaningfully expand Rocket Lab’s Space Systems business. Examples that come to mind include laser communications and ion thrusters. But Rocket Lab’s low share price makes it difficult to offer what these companies would consider to be a fair price.

Preferential treatment of SpaceX under Trump presidency,"Hi there,

I was analyzing my portfolio and was wondering what the effect of a trump presidency would mean for RKLB, since I would imagine SpaceX will absorb most of the government contracts due to Elon musk being in close ties with Trump. I'm thinking this will push RKLB to push for a more commercial approach and less relient on government contracts. 

What do you think? I will say that I believe since RKLB is a fair bit smaller than SpaceX at this point. I doubt anything will really happen in terms of competitivity from SpaceX, but I'm wondering how you see RKLB in this situation. It might as well be that this presidency opens up new opportunities in terms of Space exploration.

Vent Post,"This is me venting and I'm sure I will get many down votes and I'm sure that people will call me a short but I attached a screenshot of my Robinhood portfolio holding 13000 shares long. Anyways, rocket Lab is really starting to disappoint me. I invested in this company mostly due to Peter Beck and his famous quote ""Do what you say you're going to do"". However for the last few months they've done the exact opposite!

1- They only launched electron 2 times Q4 of '23 when they said they would launch electron 3 times (Do what you say you're going to do)

2- They have not done the Archimedes hot fire test end of 2023 and have not even updated us about another more realistic timeline (Do what you say you're going to do)

3- They definitely will not launch electron 5 times this quarter, let's be real (Do what you say you're going to do) and I get obviously weather plays a role but tell me why SpaceX never seems to have these big weather problems and when they do it's pushed back a couple days not 10 days. I get it SpaceX is obviously heads over shoulders more advanced than RKLB but they really have to step up there game if they're really trying to compete with SpaceX anytime soon

4) Neutron will NOT launch in 2024 (do what you say you're going to do) 

So once again I don't care about the down votes I'm just starting to get frustrated that the company I invested in for actually doing what they say they're going to do is actually not doing what they say they're going to do.",0,73,https://i.redd.it/2k2z1nfjd1dc1.jpeg
RKLB will dive tomorrow,"RKLB looks like it has jumped today primarily due to posts on wallstreetbets about the stock before the launch tomorrow.

I’m feeling mixed emotions as i don’t really like this type of hype hitting the stock as the gains are unsustainable - and I can’t buy more around the $5 mark. But anyway i was buying at $10+ so that doesn’t really matter.

But anyway all of these people will see a (highly likely) successful launch tomorrow (largely business as usual) and a likely successful water recovery, my theory is that all of the people on wallstreetbets that would have bought this stock will do so today ahead of launch. Therefore after tomorrow the stock will dive as people get out again (wallstreetbets users not in it for the long run). 

Could be overly simplifying and a stupid take but almost considering selling some of my shares before close and buying back after the launch (when it could dip).

"Quick write up after purchase of RKLB shares and options, launch next week","It’s kind of a weird stock for me, but I have been into RocketLab (RKLB) since ~4.20 or so, and feeling more confident about them recently.

they had a failed launch late summer, but they fixed it, got approval, and are going ahead with another launch next week. 

they recently failed to win amazon's satellite business, who went with spacex instead. 

those two things have really pushed the price down a lot in the last 6-9 months. 

however, they've inked new contracts recently, in part helped by virgin galactic folding. if next week's launch is successful, it could be a big shot in the arm. 

also, less tangible, musk and spacex have really dominated the private space industry, with a lot of massive govt contracts in the US and elsewhere. very little compitition from the likes of blue origin (dead) virgin galactic (dead), and even NASA. however, musk is increasingly toxic, questionable involvement in politics / war, non-us resident status, and a general aversion to monopoly in such a critical industry, all seem to limit the upside for complete spacex dominance. 

so I think there will be more room for companies like RKLB, both because the launch market will grow a lot in general and because spacex can't maintain their monopoly on it.

RKLB is moving quickly today / yesterday, so not sure if this is the time to buy. the launch next week is a safe bet, but no guarantee. 

last night I bought an $8 option to buy 100 shares at $5.50 dec 29, which is kind of a neat way to buy a bunch if the stock pops after the launch, without committing to actually owning the stock if the launch fails",0,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/18e4p5s/quick_write_up_after_purchase_of_rklb_shares_and/

"If Trump wins, I'm selling.","I started thinking about the election and How it could affect Rocket Lab. And it dawned on me. Trump and Elon are best buddies. Of course Elon is going to use a Trump administration to kill off competition. Trump will direct every mission, NASA and DOD to SpaceX. He could even use the EPA to deny launch permits to any other company (who cares if it's BS, this is Trump world). This could kill Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, Axiom, Sierra, Relativity and any company that could compete with SpaceX in the future. This would be a tragedy for the whole industry that is just getting started. ULA will probably survive because they have been around the longest and have their own friends on capitol hill. But it will just be those two around SpaceX and ULA under Trump, that's my prediction.

On the Flip side if Kamala gets in I think they will actively divest from SpaceX wherever they can, due to Elon dislike. They'll be stuck using Dragon for a while because it's the most proven vehicle in the US (RIP Starliner). But I could see Dream Chaser getting another look from NASA. Neutron could get preferential treatment over Falcon 9 just to screw with SpaceX. A lot of competition could thrive under a democratic administration. 

I know there are a ton of issues in the election. Most are way more important than our investments. Just a thought about how this could affect things.",0,130,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fwm36i/if_trump_wins_im_selling/

"Space Systems is not profitable, not even close","I don't know why this keeps getting repeated around here, but Rocket Lab is burning cash at a high rate and it's not all Neutron. Space Systems and Launch are both losing money and don't seem likely to make a profit for many years. 

Look at their most recent annual report.

[https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1819994/000095017023006499/rklb-20221231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1819994/000095017023006499/rklb-20221231.htm)

**Page F-6: Income Statement**

$211M in revenues only produced a ""gross profit"" of $19M. Gross profit isn't a profit, it's the net revenues left over after the costs of production. Essentially its telling you that RL spent $192M building rockets and satellites to sell them for $211M ($19M more.)

**Rocket Lab lost $136M** because it spent $154M more on operating costs, which is R&D and SG&A ( Sales, General and Administrative). SG&A are things like rent, land costs, pad costs, finance, sales, software development, IT, customer service, advertising, licensing fees, boat costs, helicopter costs, etc, etc, etc.

Now if R&D ($65M) was 100% Neutron, they still would have lost $71M. But it can't be 100% Neutron. Satellites need R&D to improve and to be able to offer more features to customers. And even Electron still has R&D (attempted helicopter catches, anyone?), it still needs to improve and fix ongoing issues for customers even if its no longer the company focus.

**Page F-43 Segments**

This is the page that is leading people to make misleading claims that Space Systems is ""profitable"". It clearly states that Launch lost $7M and Space Systems made $26M in ""gross profit"". Again, this is just minus cost of goods sold (rocket/satellite manufacturing costs). It does not include all those operating costs.

Again, assuming the extremely unlikely scenario that all of R&D is Neutron, there is still $89M in SG&A. Space Systems was 70% of revenues, so if it was responsible for 70% of SG&A it would have lost $37M last year. If it was only 50% of SG&A it would have lost $19M.

**Page F-8 Cash Flow**

Separately someone said the CFO claimed that they'd be ""cash flow positive"" if not for Neutron spending. Looking at the cash flow statement tells you that's not very likely. First what is ""cash flow""? It's the amount of actual cash that the business generated during a period, which can often be different than it's reported loss/profit. This is because of things like new equipment purchases being amortized (expensed) over many years to match costs to usage. Or customers paying late, or early, the income statement just counts when the money was due, the cash flow statement counts when it actually arrived. 

First, their operations generated a negative operating cash burn of $106M in 2022. That doesn't include $42M in PPE (basically equipment purchases), which gives you -$148M ""Free Cash Flow"". FCF is an attempt to model how much cash a business generates for its owners, or if negative how much cash it needs to operate. Note that this is even higher than its reported loss from the income statement.

If we remove R&D, and PPE (107M) as ""Neutron"" expenses, they still would have had a negative $41M in free cash flow. So not even close. And it gets worse. The only reason they only burned $148M in FCF is that they gave employees stock options at a $55M discount to its true value (stock based compensation at top of operating cash flow list). That gets credited as ""cash flow from operations"" even though it didn't come from selling any launch or satellite, it came from selling cheap stock. And it means that if they had wanted to pay those employees market rate in cash, their accountants have estimated it would cost roughly another $55M.

But instead they gave out stock (18M shares in 2022, which would be worth $72M today). And will continue giving out a lot of stock since they can't afford to pay all cash. Which means that you will be getting diluted every year until they finally turn the corner on profitability and can afford to pay more cash.",11,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/127yu7h/space_systems_is_not_profitable_not_even_close/

Considering investing,"Hey there!

Invested in the wrong moment with Rocket Lab, early trading at ~15$. Since then I have looked at its performance and hasn’t liked it much.

I believe that the company has a small issue: very small launcher => no rideshares and only very expensive dedicated launches. With this, I see very hardly how it can compete with SpaceX.

However, with the recent transition to Space Systems, I am quite driven to re-invest. Is it a good moment now? Are shorts trying to drive it down atm? As a long termer I should not worry much about this, but at the same time having had a bad experience with it I’d like to reassure myself a bit more.

Any advice is appreciated!",3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/196o3lr/considering_investing/
Why would investing in RKLB be a good idea?,"""investing in technological revolutions is the least successful strategy""

Considering what is said in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZnVt\_CvL3k&ab\_channel=BenFelix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZnVt_CvL3k&ab_channel=BenFelix)

What are your counter arguments in support to holding RKLB long term (well beyond Neturon & profitability milestones)?

RKLB has high variance in possible outcomes in terms of return, hence by Jensen's inequality it must be overpriced currently.

RKLB is clearly in technological revolution category and while it may rise a lot in the near future, once it integrates into the economy and shifts from idiosyncratic to system risk, it may all deflate in the end.

*Aside: out of interest, does anyone know a single technological revolution that has NOT taken the path as described in the video (i.e. euphoria -> boom -> bust)?*",12,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fq7tlb/why_would_investing_in_rklb_be_a_good_idea/
Something BIG awaits… 🚀 + 🛰️ + 🌕+ 🛴( rover emoji ),"I was thinking the other evevning the possibilities that lay ahead for our beloved company Rocketlab..  more specifically after the facts that were shared by Adam Spice ( CFO ) regarding the purpose of the cash raise recently pointing towards having ample gunpowder for a potential MA in the near future.  
Now what would be better than acquiring a rover building company focused on lunar missions and being able to support launch and build for those assets and absorbing large government work contracts for such. It would be a win win for both and feed each others pipelines for the near and foreseeable future.  And it would really put a company like rockletab at the heels of SpaceX in terms of utilization by US government and potentially others interested in utilizing their entire power house.
Just a thought 💭 but it did put a smile on my face that we are part of a company that has limitless potential and is being driven forward by a group of individuals and shareholders that truly BELIEVE in space exploration and to boldly go where no man has gone before… ( TNG theme in the background)

"Talent transfer from SpaceX and ""Elon effect""","Not sure if this has been discussed, but are we seeing folks move from SpaceX to RKLB since Elon became well...a little unhinged. I'll admit I lean left and not on Twitter/X, but from what I see him throw out publicly and say about people, I could see this turning off people and consider what from what I can tell would be a very different corporate culture. 

I guess what I'm asking is does anyone see it as a bullish signal that the industry leader in a market with very few players has a leader that seems to be turning off a lot of people - including employees. 

On the other hand, if you have a ton of SpaceX shares, it would be incredibly difficult to walk away from what could be a pretty lucrative IPO.",4,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/16irpai/talent_transfer_from_spacex_and_elon_effect/
Realistically how much money is there to be made?,"I am starting to have my second doubts about RKLB as a growth stock.

How many companies will need to launch satellites, etc. into space? Won't that just cause more debris in space and increase chances of collision. We might come up for a better technology in that time that replaces need for them before even whole space thing starts to pick up.

There is a reason we haven't been to the moon is such a long time. Space travel is extremely expensive and what do we really gain from it monetarily?

RKLB - Price movement for the week,"EDIT - Another good example of why, as a trader, we rely so heavily on confirmation candles (today isn't a good example of that, the day developed in regular trading hours). But knee jerk reactions cause ""disaster"". I was hopeful we'd maintain a hammer, but for whatever reason the price was pushed below $14. We simply won't know from this if the shift is significant or will be taken out tomorrow, etc.

I know there's a lot of TA naysayers but I nailed the last one and I believe I'll nail this one.

Here's why: Max pain is at $16 and everyone wants to fight over $16. I don't think it'll achieve $16, I wouldn't be surprised if it pins to around $14.50 (a historical strong point).

But today formed another hammer. I circled both hammers.

The importance of the hammer isn't its color (buy/sell candle) but it's shadow, which is very long (bottom thin line).

A hammer can't stand alone, it needs to be bookended by a downtrend on the one side and a confirmation candle on the other side (tomorrow's trading).

But, so far we have 2 of the 3 conditions.

So I think RKLB traders want to move the price to the next point of resistance which is the 20MA which is my default of the Bollinger Band.

Why a trader will do that? Well if a market maker can spike the price before options expiration (or plunge the price), they will do it....they'll only be held back by a market maker on the other side of the trade.

Think about it, wouldn't you love to be able to buy calls AND make the price MOON? Of course. So the battle is between those trading groups and that's where the balance is found. Any down-side trader is going to make a last stand over the 20MA.

If they can't hold its price under the 20MA often times they give-up and this leads to a gamma squeeze (as opposed to a pin).

I don't care to look at the GamEX anymore...it's tedious and not necessary, I'm willing to bet the GamEX (islands of stability) are about $14, and $16. So the fight will push the price to either side. And the $14ers were winning, but the hammer shows that they are pretty weak at $14. So if we have confirmation tomorrow, I'd say we can see a pretty strong bullish run to Friday (expiration date).

If you're a buyer, I wouldn't buy on FOMO on this one, a whole new battle starts over the Nov19 Expirys....could go either way.

If there's a really strong run, it'll Gamma explode, rather than pin.

If you're a seller wait until closer to Friday to consider taking profit.

&#x200B;

[Original hammer](https://preview.redd.it/17bm8u13p1t71.png?width=978&format=png&auto=webp&s=f678acd9e65d39511d2d9a44cfedae88bcf53a13)

&#x200B;

I don't see this as significant because I zoom in to a 15 minute chart and see that the sell-off was one large trading block and is looking to get ""taken out"".

The price isn't accepted at $13.60.

The lower price was achieved on lower volume.

While I believe in the company, it still hasn’t shown profitability, which is concerning as the valuation climbs so fast. We’ve seen similar rises with other tech and space companies, and the market often corrects itself when they fail to show long-term profits.

A small analysis of the stock seeing the launch today,"As you can see, there is a canal. The stock has been going up steadily, with some peaks at market open for the last week. The moving average is well in the middle of the canal, which suggests that the stock is nicely going up.

Now to more fundamentals: it’s no surprise that this is due to the launch. Some hype is building up around this launch I believe, and there are two possible outcomes in my option:

- Either we have the same behaviour as last months: investors are not convinced yet and positive events (such as successful launches) drive the stock down. In this case, it would be smart to set some puts previous to the launch

- Investors are convinced with this launch and the stock soars

In my opinion, we will have something in between. The rule of three, right? Until we don’t see three successfull consecutive launches, nothing good will happen. So my guess is the launch will not really affect the stock.

All of this assuming it will go well! Haha

Any thoughts? Just my humble opinion here of a longterm rocketlab holder who likes trading

Timing the market,"No, you can’t predict the future, at least not with any certainty. But an investor (or their algorithm) can have a sense for whether it’s a good or bad time to buy or sell. You can test out this sense by either waiting until you think it’s a better time, or by acting immediately while also watching what would have happened if you’d waited until you think is a better time.

At the point when I made the decision to invest significantly in RKLB, I had the cash to invest. But my informed sense was that I was seeing RKLB’s potential well before the market was likely to respond fully to the opportunity. I also saw surmountable challenges ahead for the company. - Surmountable though likely to affect the share price along the way to overall success. I saw opportunity to incrementally lower my basis.

So I made what I considered to be a methodical set of purchases during the past several months as the price fell from near $8 down to almost $4. Because I’d already made some purchases going back to the Vector Acquisition days, my basis ended up being about $6.75, which leaves me underwater today, though much less below the surface than I was before these purchases. The spreadsheet I used to track this process tells me that I was able to buy 25% more shares with the same amount of cash because of the methodology I used than would have been possible if I had just made a single purchase on the day I decided to up my investment.

We live in a world of uncertainties. The world is never black & white, but rather continuous shades of gray. We can capitalize on these conditions if we keep the ""contrast knob"" properly dialed in.

* Significant control over Rocket Lab USA by retail investors implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions
* A total of 6 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership
* [Insiders have sold recently](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-rklb/rocket-lab-usa/ownership?bpId=2857233&link_type=cta)

If you want to know who really controls Rocket Lab USA, Inc. ([NASDAQ:RKLB](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-rklb/rocket-lab-usa?bpId=2857233&link_type=intro)), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that retail investors own the lion's share in the company with 30% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).

While the holdings of retail investors took a hit after last week’s 23% price drop, institutions with their 29% holdings also suffered.

RocketLab take by Sci-Fi Economist,"This weekend, I was able to connect with a prominent sci-fi economist. Here is what she says in regards to RocketLab:

""Regarding RocketLab, I YOLO'd at $3.98 per share. Why? Because before space elevators become a thing, RocketLab is in one of the top positions in the space race. The possibilities are endless - it's not just satellites that will be going up in the next 5-50 years. 

Everybody laughed at Trump when he signed off on the creation of the United States Space Force. Everybody except all the scientists, that is. Space is honestly the final frontier and the United States government knows that. Satellites are just a small part of the arsenal of goods that both governments and militaries will be sending up in the coming years. 

Billionaires don't have much to spend their money on here in Earth, besides doomsday bunkers and ridiculously large yachts. What about private space stations and race rockets that zoom around the Earth at Mach 20?

The first moon colonists are going to need a lot of supplies from Earth. There will be multiple dozens of launches daily from Earth and back. The moon isn't going to stay made of cheese for very long.

Will RKLB's share price double this year?,"RKLB share price has a history of doubling from its low during the summer and then falling down to repeat the process next year. So far, it has happened every and each year since its listing on the stock market:

* **2021: $9.5 to $21.34 from 2021/08/27 to 2021/09/09**
* **2022: $3.53 to $7.15 from 2022/06/30 to 2022/08/12**
* **2023:** **$3.76 to $8.05 from 2023/05/09 to 2023/07/19**

The 2024 low has been reached on 2024/4/16 at $3.47. What has changed from previous years besides the company's increased performance is that **the reported short interest YTD has increased by 161% from 22m to 58m shorted shares**. This huge increase right before the summer may cause a bound of a violent volatility once the 2024 doubling commences.

RKLB trades so cheaply and it is so heavily shorted that all that may be needed to revalue its stock is a shift in sentiment. Right now the stock is pricing in the most bearish of bearish outcomes. Delayed Neutron development, increased R&D costs and Electron's obsolescence. But Rocket Lab is the only space company dedicated to being a one stop shop for space applications. Suppose over this year, the management can craft a narrative that Neutron is really coming this year/early next year and with it a significant decrease in R&D costs and the growth and capture of launch and space system markets. Such sentiment shift may take time but I don't know, there are so many unusual factors with Rocket Lab that I could see it happening rapidly.

I am not betting that Rocket Lab is going to stage the most epic growth of all time. I am just betting on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06).
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year.

For RKLB Options Traders,"Whether you are long or short on this stock, one of the best ways to increase your share position (DCA or otherwise) is to play options as well. I'm long on RKLB, some of you might remember my pompous post about buying $27k of it's stock a couple months ago at $3.85, using TA to find that ideal entry point.

Regardless, I want to suggest to the rest of the community my plays this upcoming week in options, and my plays this last week. Over the last 5 trading days I used options (primarily puts) for 179% gains, with a success rate of 92% among trades. The 4 stocks I traded were RKLB, SPCE, AMD, and QS.

As many of you know, RKLB and many others entered a downtrend the second half of last week. This trend will continue into this upcoming week, including RKLB. It will hit $5, and possibly the mid-4s. This isn't just guessing, it's the way the stock's sentiment is moving based on a number of underlying factors - factors that have never lead me wrong, barring major unexpected news. 

As such, on Monday morning I will be purchasing $5 puts, and later in the week, depending on how the trend continues, I will consider $4 puts. I don't have to hit the $4 strike price to profit off of $4 puts, I just need to ensure it heads in that direction substantially if I decide to buy them. 

You don't have to believe me, but I want to share this for those of you who are interested in profiting on the downtrend. SPCE will be doing the same, along with AMD, and many others. The one thing I don't know for certain is how long these downtrends will last, but I am positive it will be at least another 5 trading sessions.",8,39,https://i.redd.it/i38ounuajy7b1.png

Back to Business - ASTR....thoughts?,"What do we all think about ASTR? I'm annoyed they will get a chance to orbit before RKLB gets a chance to continue standard operations.

What I'm concerned about is that enthusiasm for RKLB wanes while enthusiasm for ASTR rises on a successful orbital launch. RKLB is in a tough spot where people EXPECT success. That means RKLB needs to show numbers. It needs to show revenue growth:

* For Launch
* For Satellite components

And it needs to show increasing backlogs.

None of this is any time soon. I think it's next earnings are not even scheduled officially, so we are hanging in the wind hoping for catalysts and New Zealand isn't making that easy.

Feel free to discuss, I'd like to see some optimism or realism - where are you all at on the share price and company performance so far?",0,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/q85akc/back_to_business_astrthoughts/
Get in while you can....,"This is a decent sign for the bulls.

I just don't think RKLB will present a lot of opportunity to buy below $14. Originally I called a support level around $15. I don't think a few days below $15 breaks that thesis. But $14 has been much more resilient in large part because RKLB is testing its daily 20MA.

I think it is shaping to pass that test.

Furthermore at the top arrow it is forming a hammer. That's an extremely bullish price action. If I were trading (I invest differently just FYI), then the next candle (Monday) would be looking for confirmation for a buy-signal.

Since I'm extremely bullish - today would probably be the best buy-in based on the hammer at the 20MA.

The volume toward end of day would be the best sign. Reversals happen around very low volume and are confirmed on increasing volume.

And so if the volume stays relatively low but increases each next day then this hammer could be the bottom for RKLB in the near term.

The Hammer has great shadow (or lower wick, the thin tail at the bottom).

It looks set up beautifully for Monday.

Bear DD > We are at a support level and testing it. The bottom could fall out and it could go to the next lower support level. If you are not extremely bullish, or have less intestinal fortitude, it wouldn't hurt to wait for Monday's trading to see confirmation of the candle.

Expectation of Thesis > Monday will gap up above today's high.

The closer look shows promising as well. On the 15 minute chart, RKLB has crossed its 20MA for the third time since it started selling off.

It gapped below 15 and thus below the 20MA and has been testing the 20MA as resistance (from below banging on the ceiling).

It may not recapture 15 very soon. But since it lost $15 share price when it lost the 20MA then this is the price it is testing.

When it breaks above the 20MA it will break toward $15.

Especially since its daily 20MA keeps moving upward into the $14 range.

EDIT - Last note - the Volatility ranking is as high now as it was the last time it made an upward move. Usually the volatility ranking is low (along the green dashed bottom) when a stock loses price. Since Implied Volatility is the amount of interest in the options of an underlying.

It therefore makes sense that low implied volatility ranking implies low interest. And the implied volatility has now positioned itself to a move upward. Interest is growing.",4,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/puo2di/get_in_while_you_can/

Everything you should read if investing in Rocket Lab,"Key take aways:

* Amazon started at a loss - but had huge revenue growth.
* Amazon smashed the ""rule of 40"" benchmark. Revenue growth plus profit margin should be greater than 40.
* Amazon started with 11 employees, grew to 200+ by IPO.
* Amazon sold itself as capturing a bookselling market, a growing market of up to $20 billion per year by year 2000!
* Amazon today earns over 4x that entire market per quarter.
* Amazon made its own market.

The rest are my conclusions.

* RKLB rule of 40? Well its revenue growth is currently something on the order of 160% (conservative based on backlogs). Which smashes the hell out of the rule of 40 even without profits.
* RKLB and other new-space project the old market will grow to $1.5 Trillion.
* In reality. New Space will make its own market as Amazon did.

PIPE Bomb - S1 effective date coming soon.,"**EDIT -** LCID seems like a good case scenario for PIPE after effective date. I'd love to see RKLB recover within a week as LCID mostly did. But I still think the effective date is going to be a hard drop and there's money to be made there. So....

&#x200B;

Should we wait to buy until after the ""effective date"" or are there more hurdles even after that?

There's some 46million PIPE shares if I understand these mind-numbingly-legalese written S-1 forms then there's an additional 18 million to be issued in Warrants which I ignored for the time being, but is likely those will be exercised and further dilute the float.

The current float seems to be at some 31 million shares as provided by u/mass9245

>31,031,383 shares issued to the holders of Vector’s Class A ordinary shares prior to the Domestication, which reflects the redemption of 968,617 Class A ordinary shares with respect to which holders exercised their redemption right

So RKLB will gap down in price. You just can't add that many shares against the current buy-orders and not get a gap down, substantial gap down - probably.

That being said. Is there good news?

Is that the last big hurdle to this deSPAC process? RKLB has a bunch of complications in its S1 filing.

What should be the entry target for next round of buying.,"I know we all love to think RKLB is breaking free of gravity, both literally into orbit and figuratively in the markets.

But let's have a realistic discussion. 

For New Space to take off, especially a Launch company, it needs customers. And right now all of RKLBs publicly traded customers are in the toilet.

I think we're entering a phase of the campaign similar to Kursk or US Civil War's siege of Petersburg. Just some long drawn out slog.

The three leading orbital companies that have great growth prospects that are currently passed merger are RDW, BKSY and SPIR.

BKSY competes with Planet for real time imagery, but Planet isn't post merger yet and BKSY hasn't filed for S1 uet

Both RDW and SPIR are past EFFECT.

All, together with RKLB are down for some common reasons and some uncommon.

I think New Space is beaten up by drying liquidity as oil sucks up money for margin calls. Whoever messed up the energy markets messed it up big. 

The debt ceiling wasn't helping any but that's that's pushed off to December.

And China is literally imploding around our ears and it's hard to tell if it'll just implode or if it will drag capital into the quagmire as it sinks under apparently crushing debt.

So. Naturally experimental new companies aren't going to get the Lion's share of attention.

Then, RKLB normally a stronger leader is weak, I believe, until EFFECT.

After that is the nature of the thread.

If the market deems RKLBs customers (BKSY) and potential customers (RDW and SPIR) as weak...does that mean the market will also deem RKLB weak and we have to adjust our entry targets even lower? 

My goal was to enter as soon as EFFECT goes into effect.

But, now I think marker forces will drive weakness a little longer.

I'm waiting to see some strength return to those 3 stocks to reevaluate my strategy.

In the mean time all we can do is wait. I see some potential strength returning to BKSY but it is the worst proxy because it hasn't even filed its S1 yet.

What are your thoughts on the near term pricing for RKLB?

Remaining bullish long term is one thing, but I prefer an excellent entry based on monthly directions. There's more gain to be made there. But the monthly isn't looking very good right now.",3,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/q2suf1/what_should_be_the_entry_target_for_next_round_of/

RKLB Short Term Bear Thesis (Long Term Bull),"The intention of this post is to outline why I consider RKLB to be an outstanding company with an overvalued stock price. I’ve been lurking on this sub for quite some time, and I frequently see people making bold price projections for RKLB’s future stock price with little to no substance backing up their estimates. That being said, I would like to provide a detailed breakdown for why I believe RKLB’s fair value is approximately $6 per share right now. This is a short term (1 year or less) projection, not a long term projection. I look forward to hearing your feedback and seeing where we differ in opinion.

*Let’s start with the good stuff. This encapsulates basically everything but the stock price.*

**Strong Leadership**
Peter Beck is exactly the right person to be running this company. He has the perfect blend of intelligence, charisma, and modesty to make the company as successful as it has been. The track record of successful launches that RKLB has achieved is a tremendous achievement for someone that, unlike his main competitors (Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, Elon Musk), does not have more money than god. I also see no concerning loss of senior talent, and I've seen an ability to attract new talent in recent months. Quality leadership is the most important thing I look for in an investment, and RKLB appears to have that in spades.

**Successful Track Record**
As mentioned earlier, the track record RKLB has achieved with Electron has been spectacular. 53 launches with minimal failures speaks volumes about the quality of the engineering talent at RKLB. Unlike many other people that have a negative take on RKLB, I actually don’t think that Neutron will struggle to reach a successful track record of launches and profitability. The recent hot fire test of the Archimedes engine was impressive, and it appears RKLB is on track to meet their goals with Neutron.

**Positive Catalysts**
There are several catalysts which I believe could completely annihilate my expectations for RKLB’s stock to decline in the near to mid term. First, an overall increased interest in the space industry from the market as a whole. Markets are always looking for the next hot thing, and it’s entirely possible space could be that. Just like artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, SPACs, etc., the space industry at large could see a significant uptick in investor interest. This could lead to an increase in RKLB’s multiple and stock price without necessitating an increase in revenue or profitability. Secondly and tangentially, an IPO of SpaceX could greatly increase RKLB’s visibility in the market. I believe a SpaceX IPO would cause a rising tide that raises all ships in the space industry, and RKLB would benefit. Lastly, I believe RKLB has a substantial amount of “meme stock” potential. The company’s name has been spreading within the forums of people that invest in meme stocks, and it’s possible RKLB could be the next big one as many of those speculators lose faith in GME, AMC, etc.

*Now let’s talk about the negatives.*

**Revenue/Profitability**
I believe it is fairly easy to project out RKLB’s likely profitability over the next 1-3 years, and I don’t expect to see many positive surprises on either top line revenue or bottom line earnings. Revenue is rising, but predictably, and I don’t see any significant catalysts for revenue to surprise on the upside. The revenue isn’t explicitly a negative as revenue growth has been strong, but the stock price relative to revenue is beginning to become unsustainable. 

RKLB became public in 2021 through a SPAC so we can’t too far back with their financials. In 2020 with seven Electron launches, RKLB had $35MM in revenue or about $6MM per launch.  In 2021 with six launches, RKLB had about $62MM in revenue or about $10MM per launch. In 2022 with nine launches, RKLB had $211MM in revenue or about $23MM per launch. In 2023 with nine launches, RKLB had about $244MM in revenue or about $27MM per launch. For the last 12 months (June 2023-June 2024) across twelve launches, RKLB had about $326MM in revenue or about $27MM per launch. These numbers show strong growth in launch count, total revenue, and revenue per launch. As we all know, most of RKLB’s revenue is outside of launch services, but their ability to launch successfully is critical for their future ability to generate revenue and profitability across all their business lines. For the first half of 2024, RKLB had about $200MM in revenue and they are projecting about $100MM in the third quarter. For the full year, I am assuming they settle in around $400MM in revenue for the year. Very solid revenue growth compared to 2023.

That’s all positive, but the stock price as compared to that revenue is overheated, from my perspective. Based on most recent valuations, it appears the market leader in RKLB’s industry is currently valued at about 23x 2023 revenue or 15x projected 2024 revenue. Obviously, SpaceX is a private company that is valued differently than in the public markets, but this multiple seems reasonable for the industry’s profit margins and growth expectations. I’m aware that RKLB’s business lines aren’t identical to SpaceX’s, but I believe Wall Street will utilize similar logic when establishing an appropriate multiple for RKLB. However, given SpaceX’s dominance in the industry and the significant amount of execution risk remaining in RKLB’s growth trajectory, it would be appropriate to apply a lower multiple to RKLB to account for this risk. At a stock price of $10 or a market cap of about $4.9BB, RKLB is trading at a 20x multiple on 2023 revenue or 12x expected 2024 revenue. From my perspective, this is not a large enough discount compared to SpaceX. I believe that RKLB’s multiple should be no more than half of SpaceX’s - 11.5x 2023 revenue or 7.5x projected 2024 revenue. This would equate to a market capitalization of $2.8BB to $3.0BB. This range of market capitalizations would equate to a stock price of $5.50 to $6.00 per share.

**Psychological $10 Barrier**
As previously mentioned, RKLB IPO’ed through a SPAC merger back in 2021 at about $10 per share. After experiencing a large but short-lived pump in the share price, the stock quickly dove down to the $4-$5 range where it stayed for years. Investors that entered a RKLB position at IPO or in the immediate run-up post-IPO are finally seeing an opportunity to exit the shares of a company that has done nothing for them for years as the S&P, Dow and Nasdaq have hit record highs. That being said, I think $10 will be a very difficult barrier to break both for practical and psychological reasons. The vast majority of companies that IPO’ed via a SPAC are still trading below their IPO price today. Increases in the share price above $10 are likely to be short-lived as we saw on September 30th, the first trading day after public confirmation of the successful hot fire tests of the Archimedes engine. 

**Conclusion**
In summation, I believe RKLB’s share price is experiencing a short term pump above what I’d consider to be a sustainable market capitalization based on their current and future revenue expectations. I expect the shares to return to $6 range before year end. I do not expect the shares to return to the $4 range. In the spirit of disclosure, I should mention that I previously worked for a private equity company that still holds a substantial stake in RKLB and SpaceX, but I was not directly involved in the private equity arm of the company so I had no special access to their investment theses or MNPI. I do still own approximately $50,000 in equity shares of my previous company. As it relates to more direct RKLB-related investments, I have a number of November 2024 put options with a $7 strike price that I paid approximately $.20 per share for. In the event my investment thesis plays out as I expect, I intend to convert the profits from the put options into an equity stake in RKLB with a holding period of 5+ years.

$ASTR successful launch,"I’m finally unbanned. Treat me as internet explorer.

Overall I believe this is good news; there is a wide market for launch companies, the more the sector expands the merrier. Encourages competition and we know RKLB doesn’t want to be just a launch company; they want to offer inclusive services (reason or acquisitions), be fully reusable (Neutron) and launch and make their own constellation of satellites outside of Earth.

"Out of Gilmour Space Technologies and Dawn Aerospace, which of the two poses the strongest competition to Rocket Lab?","Hello everyone,

I am just wondering, out of the various competitors to Rocket Lab, two notable firms are based in Australia and New Zealand respectively (noting that most Rocket Lab launches happen from New Zealand and a decent portion of Rocket Lab's workforce is still in New Zealand).

The first of these companies intends to launch a hybrid rocket called Eris from the Bowen orbital spaceport in a month or two from now. However, they have faced issues in the past with significant delays from a planned 2022 launch date. Additionally, the only flight test of their hybrid technology, using a scaled down suborbital rocket called One Vision, [failed in 2019](https://www.gspace.com/post/one-vision-statement). Others have commented on the general deficiencies of their hybrid technology in comparison with more mature solid or liquid systems. Also of note, the recent signing of a Technology Safeguards Agreement between Australia and the US has made the firm concerned about overseas competition in Australia.

The second of these is a company spread across New Zealand, the Netherlands, and the United States with the end goal of building a spaceplane. While they have not yet gotten a space plane to work, they have been able to build a scale prototype. Also interestingly, Dawn Aerospace has also successfully [built cubesat thrusters](https://www.dawnaerospace.com/latest-news/b20-thrusters-proven-in-space). While vastly smaller and less complex than an orbital rocket, having existing space heritage may boost investor confidence.",7,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1bbw975/out_of_gilmour_space_technologies_and_dawn/
It's about the volume - stop worrying,"To those who keep track of their position's value, you have to realize that the value is weighted by the volume.

If the volume were 1 trade, then the value of the stock is whatever that trade was. So low volume is a misleading price.

For a bullish stock, in general, buy low volume, sell high volume. Right now RKLB's price reflects lower volume than its power day after earnings. So if you bought too high, DCA down when the volume is lower.",6,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/pnkbk7/its_about_the_volume_stop_worrying/

"RKLB, what it is, what it could become.","Peter Beck, the CEO of rocket lab has been in the space industry for 20+ years, he has an extensive background in building rockets unlike Elon Musk. In addition to this, last year they appointed a new member to their board of directors. A former lieutenant general of the space force. DOD contracts are huge in the space industry and rocket labs has already proved that they are capable of grabbing these contracts even with the existence of space X. Rocketlab has had negative revenue for a long time only because of the ambitious management teams. They constantly pour money into evolving and expanding their lineup most recently with the introduction of the neutron rocket production. In addition to being a leading launch provider, number 2 in launches last year only behind space X. Rocketlab also has an extensive space system production (creating parts for other space companies to use) which has been somewhat successful funding their rapid development and expansion. In addition to all this, Russia is becoming more interested in space, proposing a nuclear power plant in space along with other far fetched ideas, the importance in this is not questioning if it’s possible or not but understanding that increased interest in the space sector could lead to rapid industrialization and innovations greatly favoring rocket lab",23,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1bi5b2w/rklb_what_it_is_what_it_could_become/
day 1 update to my RKLB short position,,0,34,https://i.redd.it/5sj6lzn3e0t71.jpg
I think a short cover has begun.,"We'll really see tomorrow - and I mean a broad indexed recovery.

Basically economic news is still good. The FEDs are in the Goldilocks zone, Inflation is in the Goldilocks zone (0.01% higher than expected, big fygging whoop), earnings are upside surprises...longs are not overleveraged (so don't need to unwind), bearish sentiment has put a lid on growth and increased the put/call ratio, shorts are over extended AND.....most of the market (lower market caps especially) have already entered and exited or are near apparent bottoms of market corrections and sell offs and have been for 2 months.

Soooo...if tomorrow's strong, I think it'll rally through Friday as a Short Cover.

And if Monday continues the rally - it's likely it'll persist through to the end of the year.

I think a lot of people on short-side don't see a lot of downside left and so it's a Mexican Standoff. First to pull the trigger might just get out with all the profits.

EDIT - If we're down again tomorrow I don't know what the fyg is up with RKLB. Even SPIR, which is a turd, rallied strong at end of day.

The rally isn't well explained by good news, I think the lukewarm news just represents a bottom and shorts know they need to get out while they can.",15,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/q7odpa/i_think_a_short_cover_has_begun/
RKLB is worth ~11.70 but Institutional Buyers are in near ~15.,"OK - my previous work was deleted by the Rocket Lab subreddit, I didn't know about this place when I first posted. But I'll just give you my answers rather than show you my work.

A stock never trades for what it's worth, it trades at a premium.

* RKLB is about $11.70/share - I calculated this based on money inflows.
* RKLB institutional buyers cost basis is about $15/share. This matters because that is the most likely support level. It would be difficult for RKLB to trade below 15/share.
* RKLB is an automatic sell above $18.50 - Institutional buyers over-buy shares to sell shares at higher prices to lower the cost basis for their targets.

Example: You want to own 1,000 shares. The stock is trading at a premium. You estimate an expected move of $5 (this was true for RKLB on Wednesday when I created my winning position at an adjusted cost basis of $11.71). You buy 2,000 shares at an average price of $17. You sell 1,000 shares at an average price of $19. You hit your target of 1,000 shares at a cost basis of $15. (ROUGHLY).

To do this, institutions sold anything above $18.50. More specifically they sold on Thursday at anything above $20. But a second round of selling was at $19.50.

On Friday the sell mark was about $18.50 on very low volume. So either the institutions finished their positioning or they had a few positions to finish and took it around there.

**WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN FOR YOU?**

It means:

* ***Buy around 15*** (today is testing that target. I think I will wait till tomorrow for some market bleeding to finish, and then confirm my next target. I think I'm aiming for a price of $16 and an adjusted cost basis of about...$12.50 or $13 while expanding my position by 6.25%. If anyone cares what I'm planning).
* ***Sell around $20 - maybe $18.50*** \- I think demand is around there. Institutions want to keep their cost basis down and they'll bleed off shares around there for NOW. That won't always be the case. But until next earnings that's what's going to likely happen.
* If you're long on RKLB and don't care about lowering cost basis further....you can ignore the sell (demand) pools. The buy (support) pools are more important to you.
* Since stocks trade at premiums, you probably can't hit $15. I'd be highly surprised if it does. But if it does I'd expand my position by the difference. So if it hits 14 then I'll expand my position by an additional 6.7%.

Lastly - why is RKLB down?

1. Because institutional buyers are at 15 and don't need to see gains yet, so they sell to lower cost basis and aren't opening positions.
2. Market at large is  depressed and may be for the rest of the week. But I'm generally bullish on the market at large, I think the bleed off last week was perfect.
3. Sep - Oct look like sideways months, so not much activity will happen over next few weeks.",16,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/pnk06d/rklb_is_worth_1170_but_institutional_buyers_are/

To the Ones Sleeping on RKLB,"A few months ago I stumbled upon RKLB and it was hella low… but I never pulled the trigger. As of late it’s been moving and so naturally i’ve been looking into it more and more and wanted to get a feel for how it stacks up against the competition (This is just for people who are relatively new… very obvious info). Rocket Lab is up against companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and some smaller guys like Astra and Firefly Aerospace.
 
Obviously Musk is the big dawg of the commercial space sector, with a $210 billion valuation. They dominate the industry with cheap rideshare missions for small satellites, which is bad news for Rocket Lab since they’re targeting the same market. Pretty much…. SpaceX’s scale and success are the biggest threats to Rocket Lab, hands down…. especially with the funding they just pulled too.

Blue Origin, while worth around $12 billion because they have Bezos running the show, the company is absolute dogwater for now and 0 threat. They are yet to surpass a suborbital launch lmao.

Now, Astra and Firefly are smaller but focused on launching small satellites at low costs. They’re not doing as many launches as Rocket Lab, but they could be disruptive by offering cheaper alternatives in the future but for now it's nothing crazy.

One company in this whole commercial space industry that kinda made me pause was Virgins Orbit. To really understand Rocket Lab’s position, I started looking into Virgin Orbit’s story. Basically for some background, they were another promising company in the small satellite market, valued at around $200 million before going bankrupt in 2023. This got me thinking though… was Virgin Orbit ever worth more? Turns out, at its peak, Virgin Orbit was valued at around $3.7 billion because of the hype around their air-launch system.

That’s when I started to feel a little nervous. If Virgin Orbit, a company once worth billions, could go bankrupt, what about Rocket Lab? With a current valuation of $5.5 billion, it’s not that far off. Given how tough the space industry is (super high costs, tons of competition, substantial loss when things go bad, etc), it’s a fair question to ask if Rocket Lab could face a similar fate.

After digging deeper (GPT search is goated for this), I found some key reasons Rocket Lab is way more robust and unlikely to follow in Virgin Orbit’s footsteps:

* Unlike Virgin Orbit, which struggled with consistent operations and reliability, Rocket Lab has a proven record of successful launches. As of now, Rocket Lab has completed dozens of successful Electron launches, building customer confidence and expanding its market share. Looking at Virgin Orbit…. Basically they had only completed a handful of launches and faced way more technical issues. Rocket Lab's reliability in delivering payloads on time and at a competitive cost is a significant advantage over the difficulties Virgin Orbit experienced.  
* Rocket Lab is not solely dependent on launch services. It has successfully diversified into spacecraft design, satellite components, and satellite management services, which provide additional revenue streams. This strategic diversification helps mitigate the risks associated with relying solely on launch operations, which was one of Virgin Orbit’s weaknesses. Virgin Orbit primarily focused on air launch technology.  
* Rocket Lab has future projects like the development of the Neutron rocket, which will allow it to compete in the medium-lift launch market, giving it access to larger payloads and way more lucrative contracts. At this point… Virgin Orbit was still trying to establish itself in the smaller payload market when it encountered financial troubles (so they weren't even able to get past logistics). . Additionally, Rocket Lab has been working on reusability with Electron, which could further reduce costs and increase profitability over time, a significant factor that Virgin Orbit lacked.  
* Rocket Lab has raised significant capital and managed its finances well, with plans to grow its business strategically. Virgin Orbit, despite its initial $3.7 billion valuation, faced liquidity issues and struggled to raise funds, eventually leading to bankruptcy. Rocket Lab’s revenue has been growing steadily, and while it is not yet profitable, the company's long-term plans for increasing revenue through more launches, satellite services, and new rocket developments give it a clearer path to profitability than Virgin Orbit ever had.  
* The demand for small and medium satellite launches is growing due to the rise of satellite constellations for communications, earth observation, and defence. Rocket Lab is well positioned to capitalise on this, having established itself as a trusted provider. Virgin Orbit’s limited ability to scale and capture a significant portion of this growing market played a role in its downfall.

So yeah, while I had some initial concerns comparing Rocket Lab to Virgin Orbit’s downfall, it’s clear that Rocket Lab is in a much stronger spot

Fair criticism of Neutron in a YT video,"His argument: On other launch vehicles the fairings are still attached to the 2nd stage AFTER stage separation. To still protect the payloads for a while.
With Neutron and the fairings attached to the 1st stage, fairings will have to be removed from the 2nd stage BEFORE stage separation.

-> need other trajectories/ have the 1st stage do more of the work (that comes in handy- RocketLab wants to cut costs as much as possible on the 2nd stage, so more work for the 1st stage, less for 2nd could help)

Why you have PIPE all wrong,"Anyone who has listened to me knows 2 things.

1) I learn from others but am a vociferous ahole.

2) I'm very bullish about RKLB.

But let me curb your enthusiasm with some realism.

RKLBs float is about to increase by 2x. More like 115% actually.

I know everyone thinks that means that you just buy more shares and the stock will go up.

Let me put it in perspective. 

How ever many shares you COULD BUY at $15 now. 

Multiple it by 115%.

That's how many MORE SHARES you need to buy just to keep the price the same.

So ask yourself.

If you are unable to buy 2x the shares at $15.

The price won't stay at $15. It must come down.

If you could use 100% of your capital to buy RKLB at $15 then the price must fall to $7.50 to meet the new supply demand curve.

I'm definitely not saying RKLB will depreciate by 55%.

Why companies like $RKLB succeed in G2M even though existing players have the stronger balance sheet,"Large companies often fail in emerging markets due to their inability to adapt to changing technologies, consumer preferences, or market conditions. Of the original 12 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in 1900, only two have survived. **U.S. Leather** dissolved in 1911, as the demand for leather declined with the rise of synthetic materials and changing manufacturing needs​. Similarly, **Tennessee Coal & Iron** was acquired by U.S. Steel during the Panic of 1907, as it struggled with financial instability and competition​.

**American Cotton Oil**, which later became part of Unilever, shifted focus from cotton oil to food and consumer products, but it initially failed to capitalize on emerging industrial and chemical trends​. **American Tobacco** lost its dominance due to anti-trust laws that split the Tobacco Trust in 1911, reducing its market share and power​.

**Distilling & Cattle Feeding** was a major player in alcohol production, but Prohibition in 1920 crippled the company, forcing it to pivot to chemicals and eventually become Millennium Chemicals, losing its original market​. **National Lead** shifted from lead production to titanium dioxide, but its failure to keep pace with environmental regulations and new technologies saw it lose relevance​.

Whether it's 2025 or 2026, at some point pretty soon they'll be launching NG at decent cadence. Different from Stoke or Relativity which are doing interesting things but hasn't proven to to be able to go orbital which is as hard as making an engine (or harder).

Let's talk valuation - what do we think RKLB is worth?,,10,28,https://i.redd.it/apfxqn9rl3o71.png
Not astrology! Promise!!!  Just sharing what I have been watching on the latest uptrend…,"Not an astrologer.

(Post is) Not really a conversation starter or anything too noteworthy, but sharing because it does display strength and accumulation. 

Nfa though. I’m sharing something that reinforces my thesis. Rocket Lab will be 100$ a share and it won’t be a pump and dump (long time from now, but it’s happening).

This is how I know.

Connecting the chart / daily price action, and the accumulation that has happened on this uptrend... 

When share price has dipped to the low end of a range (chart flattens out for a week or so), I have noticed large scale orders spike (not retail buys, massive buys). Noticed the same thing when the candles trade sideways on each step of the staircase on this last rise. The large orders hit the tape on the lower end of the price range. Then, share price takes the next step up.

Like I said, nothing noteworthy. What it displays though can give you, us dumb money retail investors, a little more confidence in holding your shares. You selling isn’t going to really do anything to the price, not trying to sell you on my thesis…. but maybe it will help you not bail on an opportunity to change your financial situation without doing anything… Don’t get scared out of your position. 

The spikes on the price cost distribution chart display consolidation / institutional buying in at the low end of the trading range / building positions. 

To connect the images simply…

First image displays the daily chart, each candle is 1 day. The sideways price action is accumulation and is directly correlated to the spikes on the “cost distribution chart in second image. Then the last image displays the order flow for today. Notice the large scale orders. That is not retail investors. That is institutional buying and they hold their shares for a very long time. This allows share price to keep going up. Gradually, and not without dips.

Blackrock owned 4.9% of the company (just under disclosure requirements / 13 g). They bought another 1.1% of the company (disclosed last week, think they have 15 -30 days to file the 13). Yes they own everything, but a ~6% position is not to be ignored.

More institutions will follow. Current institutional ownership is just over 57%. Has increased steadily since the decrease in inst ownership when Kholsa distributed shares / lock-up ended. That was when price was ~ 4.50. 

If something negative happens (news / launch failure) look at the spike on the price cost distribution chart below the one we are at now. That is what stock astrologers call support levels. Buy more then. Usually takes another negative event to break that one.

This is the easiest money I have ever made. I’m just a science teacher. Money for nothing is welcomed. 

You do you, but hope you make money. There is plenty to go around. Would hate to see institutions make that money instead of you all reading Reddit posts on a Thursday night.

RKLB in the Upside Down! Anyone else think our stocks is from Stranger Things?,,10,8,https://i.redd.it/gfdmklwka8a91.jpg
Update on my technical analysis from last week.,"So I mentioned last week that RKLB was testing its 20MA and that the hammer was a good indicator, but we needed a confirmation candle. Well today, barring any drastic changes, we have tha confirmation.

RKLB price gapped-up, largely to follow the 20MA, and so there is a bullish trend forming.

That being said, that trend can be impacted by headwinds from any market headwinds such as a Federal Government Shut Down. That usually doesn't impact the trend and is what oscillators are for. You buy the dip when the headwind causes price to fall in an up trend.

You short the break-out when a tailwind causes prices to rise in a down trend.

That's oscillation.

In this case, I'd say RKLB finally has formed its first, new, uptrend and probably someone with big purchasing power is just following the 20MA since there's such close correlation.

Also, this gap up is forming on increasing volume, very healthy sign.

Only the beginning…,"
Rambling bull shiz…. Just ignore.

When you get a half a billion contract to build spacecraft, it may be a sign that the company is legit. Or not. (Deleted a comment on how there have been some that are hating on the stock for its price dropping from 8$ a little while ago, I was happy and bought more shares). 

What I was most worried about was a share offering due to low cash on hand. That worry has fully subsided and I fully expect higher volume and increased volatility than ever seen before…

One thing I am sure of is profitability even while r and d on neutron continues. One thing I am not sure of is when. 

While I do not care when profitability does occur, Rocket Lab has inarguably just become a different “animal” so to speak. 

While I have known that the pursuit of neutron has been the barrier to profitability, not everyone does.

Beck / Rocket Lab could be a viable candidate to beat Musk / spaceX’s starship to functionality with Neutron. A lofty and worthwhile goal. I believe Rocket Lab will at worst be a close second to deliver an interplanetary human carrying vehicle.

Regardless of all of that… 

Rocket Lab is no longer worried about cash. That clears up any worry I had. 

When I have free cash, enough to buy 272 shares. I will buy to get to 4k shares. Believe we are no longer a penny stock (under 5$). If wrong, I will consider myself lucky.

$2B market cap,"I need around $9 per share to break even. Right now at \~$4.25 RKLB's market cap is $2B. That seems like an already rich valuation for the company even if launches of electron were to say double. I know most people are saying major growth from here is dependent solely on Neutron's success but will that even be enough to double the market cap?

Looking at the valuation of RKLB's peers in the startup space sector (ASTS, Blacksky, Redwire) it is already very richly valued in comparison. Furthermore in comparison to established Aerospace & Defense sector stocks like Embraer, Maxar, AAR, and SPCE it seems like $2B market cap is just about inline with them already even with its limited (though very successful) launch schedule.

Should I re-invest now?,"Hello!

I love Rocket Lab, and since I work in the space industry I feel like I can understand better what is going on with the company and therefore invest better.

However, I am starting to invest, I have a diversified portfolio with some bigs and some startups, tech, biotech and engineering, so I don’t want to put all my eggs to Rocket Lab. On top of that, RocketLab is a very weird stock in terms of market response.

So, I have an average of 4.90, and I lost the opportunity to invest when it was around 4 because I did not have the money (I had plenty other operations ongoing to transfer from one trader to another so I needed money)

In any case my question is: should I re-invest now? Should I wait for the hype after the 55M$ news to go down?

I know that in the longterm even 1$ difference won’t change much, but with low money on my hands my only chances at growing the portfolio is timing well and shorting.

RKLB back to $15.50! What's going on?,"Someone pointed out PLTR had a similar thing yesterday. So when I investigated I think this makes more sense.

I have had a hunch that market makers are trying to lock short-options sellers into their trades, specifically put sellers who will be left holding the bag for the market makers when they convert a lot of shares.

To do that they are keeping premiums higher than they normally would be.

It made sense to me that they could push the price down for only so long because this is like pushing down a buoy.

So when the price can no longer be pushed down, what to do? Spike it real high, then crash it. And here's why.

As you can see with PLTR - the implied volatility went through the roof. Which there's two ways to keep short-option high priced (Lock a short-option trader into their trade), move the price against the option, or raise the volatility.

**HOW TO CONFIRM THIS?**

Tomorrow, if $14 Puts stay above $1.35 (right now it's $1.75) then I'd say this confirms the reason of the action.

**Where's the battle being fought?**

The battle between us and the market makers is being fought over who holds the bag when SEC pulls the EFFECTIVE trigger. For instance - I closed out my short-puts for a profit. But if I waited too long (until today) I would have been near a loss. Even at $1.75 I'm at a profit still, technically, just not much of one.

So the battle is being fought over who stays trapped into these trades so when the market makers need to, they exercise their long-puts on the short-putters.  


This is only part of what I think is going on, there's also a battle over $10 calls and a few other strikes. Etc.

But - I think the price action is suggesting that as time is running out on the Oct 15s, that the Market Makers are running out of what they can do to control the premiums of the options.

Eventually an option is either in the money or out of the money and is either worth something or worth nothing. And the Market Makers are fighting over keeping premiums high enough to lock in trades while the value of the premiums are quickly evaporating due to time running out.

RKLB - Finally Taking off?,"I think this is it. Take off. $12.30 has proven a buy wall, but more importantly we have two very key indicators we finally hit a bottom and it's ripe for reversal.

1. Technical - a ""doji"" which suggests a lot of money on the sidelines ready to pile in to which ever side wins. And since we're pretty down and every short gets bought-up above $12.30 I think it's safe to say which side will win.
2. Structural - Options premiums are increasing in price. This is usually up to the market maker and they do it to put a lid on expected upward moves. It's partly mechanical as they try to remain neutral, and its partly opportunistic as they want to harvest demand. TL;DR, increasing premium price means increasing demand for the stock.

Opinion - Re NZ Level 3 lockdown and potential launch date,"Just wanted to share a little perspective from a New Zealander.

Auckland has just returned to Level 3. This means that if you are able to, you are required to work from home. This is not an advisory, but a requirement. The rest of the country is at level 2, which means you can return to work, but there are significant restrictions in place regarding social distancing etc. 

Considering that NZ went to Level 4, complete lockdown when a SINGLE case of the Delta variant appeared, there are many people surprised that we are returning to level 3 when we are still seeing around 20 new cases a day. There are still a few surprise cases that they can't track the source, so this is by no means the last time we'll be seeing further spikes.

Auckland will remain in level 3 for at least two weeks, and quite possibly longer when you consider the number of new cases. 

How will this effect Rocket Lab and it's launch schedule? Well, although their launch site is at level 2, their Auckland facility is at level 3. I think this will have a significant effect on their ability to launch.

As at today, their next mission ""Love at first Insight"" is due to launch October 31 at 1pm. I don't think it's going to be before this date, and may well be delayed further. People are speculating that there might be a launch in the next couple of weeks, but I just can't see it.

I'm long RKLB, and waiting for the blood to wash out of the Evergrande gutter before scaling up further.",7,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/ps3nip/opinion_re_nz_level_3_lockdown_and_potential/

Cathie Wood is a believer,"&#x200B;

A post here from 2 months ago said Cathie Wood bought 157K shares. She recently bought another 638K shares. Doing the math (see below quote), average price is $5.99. I wonder if the new block she purchased was before, during or after last week's run-up?

I gave up on her early last year but still neat to see this. I may have to look at her ETFs again.

""For an ardent enthusiast of innovation like Cathie Wood, exploring opportunities in the space industry becomes a logical step, and that’s where the small-cap satellite launch company, Rocket Lab, comes into the picture.

Rocketlab could do themselves a favor and strengthen their supply chain by purchasing the company and providing much needed working capital.

Was the Neutron reveal update one of the reasons for the massive pullback in Rocket Lab?,"https://youtu.be/7kwAPr5G6WA

So I am seeing a lot of hiring for Rocket Lab and in regards to the Neutron rocket.  But how far along are they?  Did they just start developing this ?  Reason I ask is I remember seeing interviews with Peter Beck saying that one of the reasons they merged with Vector Acquisitions was to get the financing for the Neutron.  So obviously they at least had a plan in 2019-2020 for the Neutron.  But actual development?  Seems like only started in 2021.  

If you look at their financial projections, they give clear guidance on how much revenue per year in the future for launch services.  Well no way they can do over $900 million per year just on electron that charging $7 million per electron launch.  That would mean over 100 electron launches, part of that much be Neutron launches.  

So maybe that is why the stock is down so hard since the Neutron announcement…. I mean seems to be because a lot of their future business and valuation  is based on a rocket that isn’t even developed yet.

Glassdoor reviews & vacancies analysis,"(let me know if this post is not appropriate!)

# Why analyze glassdoor reviews?

Hello there, lovely people of RKLB! As this subreddit and the general interest in Rocket Lab seems to grow quite rapidly, I decided to have a look at some public information about glassdoor reviews & vacancies and share them with you. This gives me good practice scraping the data and formatting it into something digestible.

I believe that for the company to succeed, it needs talented and motivated employees. One way to gain insight into what employees think of their company is by looking at glassdoor reviews. Glassdoor is a website that allows users to (anonymously) rate their company and share their salary (ranges), giving outsiders insight into what happens inside the company.

# How trustworthy is glassdoor information?

Glassdoor reviews can be made anonymous and there is not much transparency about how many reviews on the website are made by nefarious actors (e.g. bots). About the user verification process, glassdoor mentions this:

> At Glassdoor, we aim to verify as much of our data as possible. Considering the reality of our digital age, however, we're unable to fully confirm our users' identities, the truthfulness of their contributions, or their employment status. 

There is therefore no guarantee that the reviews are all trustworthy. Regarding the vacancies, I was unable to check whether all of them are still open or if new ones are open that are not mentioned on the website. Therefore, take this disclaimer and don't see this information as a hard truth.

# Given information on Rocket Lab from glassdoor's website.

Glassdoor shows 125 Rocket Lab reviews on its website, with an average rating of 3.2 stars.  I have created a table with some ""*competitors*"" (I know, some of them don't belong but I included them for reference), showing that the total rating of Rocket Lab is on the low end of these companies.

|Company|Rating|Number of reviews|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rocket Lab|3.2|125|
|SpaceX|4.0|2.800|
|ULA|3.7|514|
|Relativity Space|3.7|112|
|ABL Space Systems|2.9|26|
|Astra|3.2|35|
|Virgin Orbit|3.7|131|

Overall, Rocket Lab scores the lowest in work/life balance, which is a recurring theme in the written reviews where people complain about not being able to work from home, bad management and a high employee retention rate.

[Rocket Lab's average rating for different aspects of the company](https://preview.redd.it/yz34ahuajn4b1.png?width=1486&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddea0378c38e457d591afe4d7824cc1fb4af7834)

# Does the rating differ per location?

One of the main questions I wanted to answer was whether some locations stood out in the rating, or whether the rating is uniform over the company.  A large group of reviews did not specify a location, but fortunately, the majority did. You can see the results in the table below.

|Location|Rating|Number of reviews|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Unspecified|3.33|49|
|Auckland, Auckland|3.20|45|
|Long Beach, CA|2.75|12|
|Huntington Beach, CA|3.5|2|
|Mount Wellington, Auckland|2|2|
|Silver Spring, MD|4|1|
|London, England|5|1|
|Wayne, NJ|1|1|

Though there are differences in rating between locations, it seems that there are too few reviews to draw conclusions about big differences between locations.

# How about vacancies?

There are a total of 200 ( though the overview on the glassdoor website shows varying amounts). I was interested to see how these were divided over the different locations and gathered the following results (some locations were disregarded due to low 

&#x200B;

|Location|Number of vacancies|
|:-|:-|
|Long Beach, CA|101|
|Albuquerque, NM|50|
|Silver Spring, MD|16|
|Wallops Island, VA|13|
|Littleton, CO|10|
|Mississippi State, MS|4|

As everyone would expect, the majority of the vacancies are currently in Long Beach.

RKLB MSR odds increased due to Elon’s recent actions. ,"I firmly believe that all of Elons recent shenanigans (getting very political very quickly, paying for votes, claims he’s talking to Putin, etc.) are only going to help RKLB. NASA administrator Nelson believes that these claims about Elon should be investigated and I believe there’s a growing anti-monopoly mindset around SpaceX right now in this industry. 

Therefore, I think that NASA is more likely to choose RKLB over SpaceX for MSR due to wanting to help get other launch providers up to a near-SpaceX level quicker. 

But they won’t just do this out of kindness, I also cannot see any other realistic candidate with RKLBs interplanetary track record. The only other real competitor (other than SpaceX) is BO and they just don’t have the resume for this. Unless their application was joint with many other organizations, I just don’t see them getting MSR. 

We should be thanking Elon for his stupidity.

We are coming off a consolidation phase and a gap up occurred today. From a technicals point of view,

1. There was a shooting star candlestick pattern on 10/24. Stock dipped by about 15% from a high of 12.09 to a low $10.16 on 10/31.  After this it crossed $13.
2. No major catalysts during this period. 
3. MACD's are crossing over and turning positive

The setup is incredible going into the earnings. I love this uptrend and I am betting that SPB has some great news to share on the earnings call. IMO, There are people seeing ""A secular trend"" and that's the driver for this momentum.  I mentioned this in my previous post. Other than that, I have no inside information.

PS: To newbie options players. This is not the best time to sell CC's. Option buyers, the premiums are just too high. Nov15 $17 1254 contracts were traded for $0.12. That's ridiculous. Don't throw away your money. **Sometimes, you miss the boat. Accept it. Don't chase it. Buy shares instead.**

Is this time different? (Dramatic positive price action followed by sell off),"I have watched profit bleed away several times on this stock. Over 25k on separate moves IF I sold and bought back (below my current 4.62 average). 

I haven’t sold and have simply kept adding. Up to 4475 shares now.

Seeing profit drift away is obv lame.

I haven’t sold because I was looking for a special company. I think I found it in rocket lab. 

I am tempted to sell now as I’m sure so many of us are. 

I’m not selling because Rocket Lab will be worth 20bil eventually. I have no doubt. I don’t think it’s going straight there now, but someday far in the future 40$ shares is fully reasonable (if the company realizes ambitions).

I have read absolutely everything there is to know about the company and people (many of the board members, especially like Beck as a person and Spice is also nice- he was CFO for Qualcomm (I believe, please correct me if I’m wrong, but he does have experience in the semi / chips industry and space chips (even if only for solar cells (which I don’t think they are). I think they are making and developing chips for satellite operation / control and other various space craft in future))

Regardless of the semis / chips, the other aspects of the company are all notably exceptional. There are 4 ish various space craft at the moment (see video where Beck introduces the new names, it is funny) 

YouTube search “Rocket Lab Spacecraft Family” link: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AxEMnB9m-uw

 They have small launch fairly nailed, but more valuable and fully overlooked / not priced in is the “space systems” sector. Space companies that operate just satellites (like Iridium and ASTS) have market caps that dwarf Rocket Lab. Rocket Lab does what they do too… 

A little personal background…
Rocket Lab is 5% of my investment $ (in addition to a teacher’s pension). I have 215k in a tax deferred annuity that collects 7% fixed return. 24% of my pay goes directly into the annuity. RKLB is a 20k$ investment with money iI don’t spend every couple weeks. RKLB is very high risk I am not looking with rose colored glasses. There are many risks (Not worried about losing it all because I have the fixed return account…

Anyway, i can’t pull myself to sell this time or after any rise in share price (will sell 1000 shares at 28.50.  now, I could take 11k profit…. That just isn’t why I’m here. 

Say less, I know.

"All these posts about how RKLB is ""overvalued"".","I'm seeing so many posts about RKLB being overvalued. How it's not worth $5B today because it doesn't have the revenues to support that valuation. These posters are missing the point. You, I, analysts, pundits, space enthusiasts, or market experts don't decide what a stock is worth. Only the market decides what stocks are ""worth"". And currently it's saying that RKLB is worth 5B today not because of what it's actually intrinsically worth, but because that the chance of it being worth 25, 50, 100B+ in a few years is becoming more and more likely.

A lottery ticket is a piece of paper worth nothing intrinsically. You don't buy it for the value of the paper. You buy it because it comes with the opportunity for it to later actually be worth a large amount of money.

It's fine if you want to trade RKLB and try and call the tops and bottoms.

Just beginning to think we have a couple years before we see massive gains…,"Someone posted a comment on another post I made and it is sticking in my head.

The comment brought up that Kholsa wouldn’t exit their massive position unless they saw a better opportunity; an investment that would make them more money faster….

I am thinking that is exactly the case. I have watched google increase from 110 a share, when I bought in, to 160-170 a share and I expect it to go even higher. Bought into Microsoft with a solid position at 225$ a share. Apple shares with an average of 110$ a share and amazon at 115$ a share.

I sold everything and put it with Rocketlab because I thought we would see 100% gains sooner than later. 

Obviously not very wise in hindsight as I would have well over 30% gains.

I am just recognizing that there are better opportunities in the near term. There are many and obvious.

Would I change what I did? Obviously. Am I bothered? Absolutely not.

Not bothered because I will not miss this opportunity. There will be a day when we leave penny stock land forever. That day could be any day, but it could also be a couple years. 

It’s looking like years is likely if the macro market stays risk adverse, but that can change in a second. 

The market is what it is and is waiting on RKLB and that is annoying, but fully understandable. 

Turning a profit on paper is the real catalyst for a sustained increase in share price. Neutron launch in 2025 is another, but that is a gigantic accomplishment and an equally huge catalyst.

All of this said, I am going to be patient. I will keep buying while we sit at mid to low 4$ a share. 

If I was looking for 50% gains near term, I would have stayed in the Mag 7. I want 5x and do not see that as a pipe dream with Rocket Lab. It may take 10 years, but I am here ready to wait.

Why I am staying put through the end of year in Rocketlab,"We are reaching the end of quarter. There is one more launch this week. With that being successful, we meet all expectations. Even this launch fails it's not a big deal. We have seen both failures and resilience in Electron launches. Resilience is always rewarded.

  
Having said that, we are going to next quarter with strong tailwinds and no headwinds.

1. Increase in backlog or positive commentary on future launch opportunities 
2. These will be, well choreographed presentations. Very little risk
   1. Stage 1 static fire
   2. Stage 2 static fire
   3. Final Integration
   4. Wet Dress Rehearsal

Any positive announcement would be a catalyst for the stock to take off. **Optimism** is also a catalyst to drive higher.

Is Neutron delayed and for how long?,"PATH TO LIFT-OFF 2023-2024

Now that we're nearly halfway through Q1 24, I'd have thought that more than just one of the 5 stages for 2023 would have turned from yellow to green by now. Never mind all the other stages in 2024, which haven't even turned yellow yet. If this is a true reflection of the timescale by Rocket Lab on their Neutron Path to Lift-off, it's certainly not looking very positive for it to be on the launch pad in a complete, ready to launch state. I'm afraid just placing a bunch of various Neutron bits and pieces on a concrete pad will not suffice. I think this latest $300m cash raise was done as they realise that extra time and additional resources are required to complete Neutron/Archimedes, and I'm afraid news of this may just be around the corner.",33,34,https://www.rocketlabusa.com/launch/neutron/
Space operations and management constellation?,"With the imminent retirement of the NASA ""Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System"" (TDRS), I have been wondering if some sort of space operations and management constellation might be a good candidate for Rocket Lab's first space services constellation?

First some background courtesy of Chat GPT:

**What is the TDRS?**

The *Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System* (TDRS) is NASA's communication network used to support real-time data and command transmission between Earth and spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO), such as the International Space Station and the Hubble Space Telescope. Operating since 1983, TDRS consists of multiple geostationary satellites and ground stations, providing near-continuous coverage.

The system facilitates telemetry, tracking, and data transfer, enabling critical operations for various NASA missions. NASA is transitioning to commercial services as TDRS ages.

**What is the CSP?**

The *Communication Services Project* (CSP) is a NASA initiative aimed at transitioning from government-owned satellite communication systems, such as the TDRS, to commercially operated services. The CSP involves partnerships with private companies to develop and demonstrate advanced communication capabilities for space missions. These capabilities include satellite relay, ground-to-space communications, and data transmission, ensuring reliable and cost-effective support for NASA's future needs. The project is a cornerstone of NASA's strategy to leverage private-sector innovation for space infrastructure.

**What is SSA?**

*Space Situational Awareness* (SSA) refers to the ability to track and understand the behavior of objects in space, including active satellites, debris, and other spacecraft. SSA involves monitoring their positions, predicting potential collisions, and assessing risks to space operations. It is crucial for satellite operators, governments, and military organizations to ensure safe and sustainable use of Earth's orbits, particularly as space becomes increasingly crowded with new satellites and debris. SSA data is gathered using ground-based and space-based sensors, radar, and optical systems.

**What is a SON?**

*Satellite Operations Network* (SON) refers to the integrated system of ground stations, communication links, and software infrastructure used to manage, monitor, and control a satellite or a constellation of satellites. The SON ensures the execution of mission commands, monitors telemetry data, and facilitates two-way communication between satellites and operators. Advanced SONs often include automation, real-time data analysis, and tools for handling large-scale constellations with minimal human intervention.

**What is STM?**

*Space Traffic Management* (STM) refers to the planning, coordination, and execution of operations to ensure the safe and sustainable use of Earth’s orbital environment. It encompasses tracking space objects (satellites, debris), avoiding collisions, managing orbital slots, and coordinating launches. STM combines policy frameworks, technical systems (like SSA), and international cooperation to mitigate risks from space congestion and orbital debris, ensuring efficient and safe space operations for both public and private entities.

**What would you call a combined SSA, SON and STM system?**

A combined system integrating *Space Situational Awareness* (SSA), *Satellite Operations Network* (SON), and *Space Traffic Management* (STM) could be called an *Integrated Space Operations and Management System* (ISOMS) or *Unified Orbital Management Network* (UOMN).

Such a system would unify tracking, operational control, and traffic management functions, ensuring seamless coordination between monitoring orbital environments, controlling satellite constellations, and preventing collisions or other orbital conflicts. This integration would enable efficient and secure satellite operations in increasingly congested space environments.

Thanks Chat GPT!

I'm not suggesting that Rocket Lab will join other commercial entities participating in the CSP, there are already plenty of big names there including Kuiper and Starlink. Perhaps Rocket Lab may partner with some of them. But it occurs to me that if you want to build an end-to-end space company, that designs, builds and operates customer constellations, you'll need some of the same functionality that the TDRS provides NASA - and you may not want to rely on other commercial CSP entities to provide it.

Back over to Chat GPT:

**Describe a UOMN constellation? How many satellites? How many ground stations? What orbits required?**

A *Unified Orbital Management Network* (UOMN) constellation would likely require a combination of LEO (Low Earth Orbit) and MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) satellites to cover both tracking and communication needs. The number of satellites would depend on coverage requirements, but a network of 30–50 satellites could be sufficient for global tracking and communication.

Ground stations would be strategically placed worldwide, with at least 5–10 ground stations for redundancy and global reach. The system would also need robust inter-satellite links, especially for real-time traffic management and command/control capabilities.

Thanks Chat GPT!

OK so Rocket Lab would need some help with ground stations, and whilst they have their own RF space radios, they may also want to pick up some space optical expertise. With $300M in the Mergers & Aquisitions kitty, perhaps there are some targets?

Important day for $RKLB [Specific Risk],"Hey everyone,

If you didn't know today was a crucial day for Rocket Lab. If you have been on this sub then that means there is a high propability you have seen posts relating to share lockup expiration.

Share lockup expiration is a lock-up agreement that **temporarily prevents company insiders from selling shares following an IPO. This agreement for Rocket Lab lasts for 6 months and** **expired yesterday** **at market close.** Meaning that insiders including VC, CEO, manager directors, staff, etc are able to sell their stock from now on.

If we think about it, Rocket Lab announced yesterday [Rocket Lab Selected by MDA to Design and Build Spacecraft for Globalstar](https://investors.rocketlabusa.com/news/news-details/2022/Rocket-Lab-Selected-by-MDA-to-Design-and-Build-Spacecraft-for-Globalstar/default.aspx) which are honestly some amazing news that brought the share price higher than the average stock. My opinion: this news was stratigically published on that specific day to allow 'insiders' sell some of their equity the day after at a higher price than if we didn't have news.

I like to assume that some insiders have sold a SMALL amount of their equity as a result of today's 4% drop. Lets not forget the staff that make Rocket Lab awesome receive equity as a form of bonus so it is rational for them to sell some of their bonuses at market price after waiting years for this company to become public.

From the price action we can determine that insiders have faith in the company (obviously) and will keep their equity for the long term. Now our fears from the lock up expiration can finally rest in peace.

PS: if you take a look at the chart below, the purple box shows the effect of share lockup expiration. In addition a cup and handle is forming in the 3m &15m chart which is a bullish pattern.

Stratolaunch -- a competitor to HASTE?,"With the recent posts here about up-and-coming space companies which potentially compete with Rocket Lab, I figured it would be worth mentioning the one which is closest to actually taking contracts away from Rocket Lab: Stratolaunch. Their recent Talon-A1 test launch was nearly completely successful, ""approaching"" Mach 5 (the threshold for hypersonic flight), and they likely collected enough data for their next launch to be truly hypersonic. And both the carrier aircraft and Talon-A itself are reusable (well, the TA-1 version isn't, but TA-2 and TA-3 will be), so they have the potential to undercut HASTE (which is at best partially reusable) on price.

Now, obviously HASTE isn't a large proportion of Rocket Lab's revenue, and demand for hypersonic testbeds may grow fast enough that both Talon-A and HASTE are winning plenty of contracts. But the military has certainly shown interest in Stratolaunch's work, and if supply should grow enough to exceed their demand, it's not clear which company would get fewer launches as a result.",9,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1bdu1vg/stratolaunch_a_competitor_to_haste/

Hydrogen in your expander cycle (with all the problems concerning hydrogen molecules on your turbine shafts and the required sealings) increases complexity and thereby costs greatly.

So we all have our own speculations about what the big Neutron rocket reveal will be.  Could Rocket Lab announce that that timeframe of it being ready has moved up from 2024 to 2022 (or 2023)?

The US Space Force recently announced $87 million for next generation rocket testing to 4 separate companies and 3 of them for rockets ready for 2022.

Will successful Electron launches leading to bigger contracts for Rocket Lab?,"
Rocket Lab on July 29th of this year launched their first mission for the US Space Force which was successful.

Fellow Investor Sharing Information,"\*Caveat: This is not financial advice, This is a research paper on Market assessment as part of a Masters Degree Program. This post is not responsible for financial choices people make or do not make\*  


Hey Y'all, fellow RKLB investor here. I am currently a student working on my Masters in Space Operations at Embry Riddle and finished a paper talking about Rocket Lab. Take it for what you will, is not exactly a flawless product, but is my contribution to the community to educate folks about the company in hopes that our grass roots investment can help advance the industry.

Several posters have put articles from sites such as the Motley Fool, which may inspire FUD with would-be buyers or recklessly pump stocks for traders to inflate and dump shares to the detriment of a well meaning company. Through sheer-fucking-will Rocket Labs is standing toe to toe with giants and making a name for themselves in the industry and that deserves credit and truth.

Revenue growth concerns?,"Hey everyone.

earnings next week ( basically assuming same as one released 2 weeks ago). I had a question around what everyone thinks of rocketlabs future.

I know profitability is a key factor considering how cash burn heavy this industry is. The capital raise from 2 weeks ago would have helped clear some debt out and added some cash for general ops. 

My biggest worry is how do we manage to grow revenue? Other then the big $500m contract ( over a few years). What else is in the pipeline?

I guess this is more for guidance. All eyes are on future guidance for fy24 and if I understand correctly, our total backlog was around $200m before the $500m contract was won.

So upto $700m+ of backlog revenue we can earn.  Profitability I know will come at a point when heavy expense reduce but will also come when revenue starts to ramp up.  Question is when?",17,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1ayoueg/revenue_growth_concerns/

Will the current cash position be enough? ,"I know it’s the biggest taboo to talk about dilution or any type of capital raise but this industry is immensely capital intensive.

Question,"I live in Korea and in Korean sites, a number of people are concerned about RKLB because Trump said he will appoint Elon as ‘government efficiency commission’ if he becomes president.

Basically, they are worried because according to them(Koreans) Peter allegedly said that Elon is trying to suppress competitors like Rocket Lab in this field and that he is interfering w RKLB’s foothold in the industry by doing things such as lowering the launch price of the small-mounted vehicles etc.

As a result, Koreans w RKLB stocks are concerned about Trump being president since if Elon Musk takes up the government position, there is a very high possibility that he will use legal methods to push Spacex and suppress the competitions like Rocket Lab (according to them).

I want to ask if this is substantiated or just over-speculation/conspiracy by Koreans since I haven’t seen people in this Sub talk about this(or maybe you guys did and I didn’t see it).

Idk a lot of Koreans seem to be focusing on how to debate would affect the stock market, especially with Tesla and Elon related stocks and I’m curious if it’s a reasonable thing to do.",59,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fe7pcs/question/

Rocket Lab risks justify the stock price,"First off, I am long Rocket Lab. I think its incredible what they've accomplished and I have a feeling they are going to be successful in delivering Neutron, eventually. But, I see an overwhelming number of posts and comments in this sub that express a disbelief in this stock's current price and its performance over the past year. I thought it might be worth reminding some RKLB investors of the risks that exist in this stock that likely explain why institutional sentiment has been what is has, even though the company and its accomplishments are incredible. Here are three entirely plausible things that could happen in the near term that would take this stock to all time lows.

&#x200B;

1. Another Electron failure

If the next Electron launch or another one in the next few months were to encounter another major issue or failure then Rocket Lab's reputation as a proven and reliable small launch shop would start to erode. The stock would undoubtedly take a hit at least as big as the one it took after the recent failure. Thats a big and totally feasible risk and could result in loss or slowing of contracts.

2. Neutron setbacks or failures

At this stage in Neutron's development, major delays are entirely possible. Worse than that, it is  completely possible that when Neutron is first launched it fails or explodes. Maybe there is a landing failure, after all landing is something Rocket Lab have never done before.

3. Dilution

Rocket Lab is in cash burning mode. If Neutron becomes more expensive than planned, or if #1 or #2 above were to happen they could issue more shares to raise money.

&#x200B;

Again, all three of the items above are completely feasible. Together they represent big risk for investors who buy in at this moment. If any of the above were to occur while the stock price is at its current levels then I think we'd likely see the $2 range.",34,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/17vtdys/rocket_lab_risks_justify_the_stock_price/

$61K Rocket Lab YOLO Update - Up ~ $39K as of open this morning on RKLB,,12,7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/pq0kip
The reaction wheel constellation deal is older than you think…,"… and its probably already included in the backlog.

EDIT: I am probably wrong, I did not include the SolAero acquisition and their backlog in my analysis.
Sorry and thanks for pointing it out!

Q4‘21 presentation:

""Backlog grew from $183M in Q3’21 to $241M in Q4’21, to $545M today"" (today = February 2022)

$143M of the difference is the MDA/Globalstar backlog, leaving about $150M

Additional hint in the Q4‘21 presentation:
„Signed deals to supply COMPONENTS for commercial constellations, including first mega constellation deal""

Here they are talking about components and mega constellation- so not about the MDA/globalstar contract which is for a whole satellite bus and not a mega constellation.

Additional hint in the 2022 investor day presentation:
""New high volume reaction wheel (>3,000 units/year) production capability established for constellations""

3000 units per year fits perfectly with the demand of the undisclosed mega constellation

I also found a press release from September 2021 already mentioning high volume reaction wheel production: 

""construction is underway on a new production facility capable of supplying up to 2,000 reaction wheels per year to fulfil growing demand from satellite constellation customers.""

Let‘s assume, Amazon ordered all the Kuiper reaction wheels right away. That would be 3236 satellites x 4 reaction wheels = 12,944 reaction wheels

If we divide the increase in backlog in the beginning of 2022 we cannot explain ($150M) by the number of reaction wheels, we get $ 11.6 K per reaction wheel.

Does that fit?
RocketLabs CFO Adam Spice was quoted with „""we brought the cost down by almost an order of magnitude on those wheels.” in a recent article (see appendix)
Price of a reaction wheel that size is $100 k for small volume customers.
So $11.6 K per reaction wheel seems like a reasonable price. 

Reaction wheels were a super low volume business so far. According to the Investor Day 2022 presentation Sinclair had just above 200 reaction wheel units in orbit. And those 200 are spread across different sizes. Just imagine the R&D cost per individual reaction wheel. And now compare that to a reaction wheel type you can sell 13,000 of.
Safe to guess that cost came down exponentially.

My forecast of the share price range for the next five years,"I see quite a few price prediction posts on the sub, so thought I would weigh in with my own prediction after assessing revenue forecasts in some detail.  Don't make decisions based on this, forecasts are usually nonsense.  But I thought it would be fun to share anyway - since loads of you are forever speculating what the share price will be next week, month, year...

“In the short run, the market is a **voting machine** but in the long run it is a **weighing machine**.”

To me, everything over the long run depends on the revenue growth achieved - and the price that investors are willing to pay for each dollar of revenue.  Currently the P/S is circa 120.

I have put the likely range in italic text, and my actual prediction in bold text.  For my own use, when revenue estimates change meaningfully, I will update the table - happy to share the updates if you are interested.  Personally, I think RKLB are going to surprise to the upside on revenue but then I'm a bull.

I'm forecasting the price at *calendar year end*.

Notes / Caveats

Revenues for 2021, 2022 and 2023 are based on analyst estimates.  Revenues for 2024 and 2025 are extrapolated out using a revenue growth rate of 40% per annum.  If revenue estimates change dramatically, then so will my price forecasts.  I'm assuming RKLB will satisfy the '[Rule of 40](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/q42g9y/applying_the_rule_of_40_to_rklb/)'.

Yes hype and investor sentiment play a significant role in the price - but that is captured by the P/S metric.  A high P/S means investors are very confident, while a low P/S means the opposite.

I believe that the P/S will trend down as revenue growth is achieved, but in five years time it will still be nowhere near the market average of 3.15.  I think the valuation will still be pricing in a lot of new growth at that point.

If the macro environment changes dramatically, such as a stock market crash - then P/S will plummet and so will the share price.  A recession for example, could also have a knock on effect on revenues as organisations tighten there belts.  Maybe have some US Treasuries in your portfolio to give you a war chest during bad times, because if that does happen, and RKLB survive - it will be the dip of the century, and you will want to be buying.

Short Article 6/10 12:11pm - Rocket Lab USA Enters Oversold Territory (RKLB),"An article found on NASDAQ news:

Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.

In trading on Friday, shares of Rocket Lab USA Inc (Symbol: RKLB) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.9, after changing hands as low as $4.25 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 39.6. A bullish investor could look at RKLB's 29.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of RKLB shares:

&#x200B;

[Oversold](https://i.redd.it/ev5fkckx34591.gif)

Looking at the chart above, RKLB's low point in its 52 week range is $4.25 per share, with $21.34 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $4.27.

Starting Unicorns: Is Peter Beck Smarter Than Elon Musk?," 

Peter Beck has built Rocket Lab from an idea to a publicly held billion-dollar company. Rocket Lab, which was started in New Zealand and is now headquartered in Los Angeles, launches rockets, and just received a [$515 million contract](https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-wins-515-million-contract-to-build-18-satellites-for-u-s-government-agency/) from the U.S. government.

Here are the 5 Unicorn-Entrepreneurship strategies Peter Beck used to [launch Rocket Lab](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-15/spacex-rival-rocket-lab-resumes-launches-after-september-failure).

16yo sons RKLB holdings. Currently DCA $400NZD a week till 3k shares.,,31,15,https://i.redd.it/xvaqi2izbfhc1.jpeg
"A multi billion contract with Amazon - Rocket Lab is supplying 12Nms reaction wheels to the Amazon's megaconstellation of 3,236 satellites, (3 to) 4 wheels per each satellite, (9,708 to) 12,944 12Nms reaction wheels with more required for maintenance and replacement","While the CEO spoke about 2,000 reaction wheels for a single customer this year, that Amaz...ing customer will eventually need 12,944\* 12Nms reaction wheels just to get the constellation into the space and then further thousands of reaction wheels for the maintenance and replacement.

If Amazon got a discount in the range of 10-30%, let's say 20% for purposes of this dive, this deal would translate into revenues between $1.035 billion and $1.242 billion, depending on the type of 12Nms reaction wheels. Further revenues would follow from reaction wheels sold for the maintenance and replacement of deorbited satellites.

There is no way that this deal is in the backlog in its entirety as the $1 billion backlog already comprises the $515 million SDA T2TL-Beta deal, $215 million in Electron launches, $143 million Apple/MDA deal, $32 million Victus Haze deal (this also includes launch, so I've deducted 8.5 million below), $30 million out of $150 million deal for solar cells for the space prime contractor and also deals with other Rocket Lab's customers (as ""x"" below).

515+215+143+23.5 + 30 + x = 926.5 + x

1014 (total backlog) - 926.5 (known backlog) - x (unknown backlog) = **87.5 - x**

**I don't see how can the deal for over 2,000 reaction wheels this year, which may be for $160 or $192 million, not even speaking about more than $1 billion for 12,944 reaction wheels for the whole constellation, be already comprised in less than $87.5 million of unidentified deals in the current backlog. It may be possible that only a very small portion of this deal is in the backlog.**

The FCC has given Amazon the deadline of July 2026 to launch 50% of the constellation, that is 1,618 satellites, which require 6,472\* 12Nms reaction wheels. These reaction wheels need to be delivered to Amazon well before July 2026 in order to allow for time to build satellites and to remedy any potential supply hiccups and/or production accidents. Let's say at least 3 months before the FCC deadline.

According to the CEO, this year, the Amaz...ing customer will consume over 2,000 reaction wheels from Rocket Lab, which translates into 500 satellites. **Amazon will need further 4,472 12Nms reaction wheels between Jan 2025 and April 2026**, which means that this further delivery should take place in space of 16 months. That is an average of 279.5 reaction wheels per month, or 838.5 reaction wheels per Q. **That would amount to quarterly revenues between $67 and $80.5 million (between $268 and $322 million per year), depending on the type of 12Nms reaction wheels, just from reaction wheels sold to Amazon.** Compare this to $60 million in revenues from all space systems customers in Q1 2024, which might include no revenue recognition from the Amazon deal.

The CFO stated that over $426 million of the current $1 billion backlog will be recognized in next 12 months. If 12Nms reaction wheels for Amazon were in the contract then subtracting $268 or $322 million for reaction wheels from the $426 million which will be recognized in next 12 months would leave only $158 or $104 million to be recognized from all other space systems revenue streams and launches. That would mean that Rocket Lab would do only 19 launches in next 12 months (till the end of May 2025) and that Rocket Lab would recognize zero revenues from any other space systems customer beside Amazon, which is nonsense. **12Nms reaction wheels are thus missing from the backlog.** **However, the deal exists as the CEO confirmed it. There is no other megaconstellation builder beside SpaceX and Amazon who would consume over 2,000 12Nms reaction wheels this year and while SpaceX is building their own reaction wheels, Amazon lacks such capability.**

**Let's go back to 2024. Over 2,000 12Nms reaction wheels in 2024 may translate into revenues of $160 million or $192 million, that is $40 million or $48 million per quarter if they would be recognized over the all quarters of 2024.**

These revenues do not seem to be recognized in Q1 2024 as space systems revenues increased by $8.5 million from $51.5 million (Q4 2023) to $60 million (Q1 2024).

Recognizing them over the remaining 3 quarters in 2024 would amount to a jump in revenues by $53 million or $64 million. There is a jump the the Q2 2024 guidance but not on such magnitude that it could be wholly attributed to a supply of 666 12Nms reaction wheels (1/3 of 2,000 to be consumed by Amazon this year).

This leaves us with a big potential jump in the Q3 2024 guidance.

\* 9,708, ie. 3 reaction wheels per satellite instead of 4 reaction wheels, would be contrary to redundancy and a risk taking that Amazon is not known for.

Amazon stated that they intend the Kuiper megaconstellation to consist of 3,236 satellites:

[https://www.aboutamazon.com/what-we-do/devices-services/project-kuiper](https://www.aboutamazon.com/what-we-do/devices-services/project-kuiper)

Let's recall that the CEO confirmed the existence of the famed single major reaction wheels megaconstellation customer while talking about upping the Sinclair Planetary's reaction wheels production:

""*And we have one customer now that's consuming, this year, they'll consume over two thousand wheels.*""

Let's also recall that the interview with the CEO and the CFO by DaveG discusses this contract, too:

""*We can't really talk too much about that but I, you know, would say that, correct me if I'm wrong but we're on track for like 2000 wheels this year or something like that (...) we can apply that scale manufacturing to those other smaller volume orders and get the cost reductions that go on with. It should be a material margin enhancer to all the rest of the business as well. It's not just, you know, helpful that we're getting, that we have this megaconstellation customer (...) Is the revenue being recognized from that deal like this year? Yes.*""

What many people miss about Rocket Lab,"I have seen a lot of posts on here and WSB that only discuss the launch side of Rocket Lab.

Rocket Lab is not just a launch company. They are way more than that. They are an end to end space company.

Take a look at these scenarios below.

Company X( basically all companies that need something in space to operate. Use ASTS for example): These companies design and build something that operates in space, but rely on another company to get their equipment there.

SpaceX: launch provider with an emphasis on launching their own constellation with further goals in space. We all know they can launch themselves.

Rocket Lab: started as a launch only company with Electron but have heavily diversified their business into space systems. Their business offers the ability to design, build, launch and operate a customers satellites or space craft or maybe their own constellation someday. This is why it is called end to end. Their business is not launch, launch is only one of their tools to more effectively do business in space. Neutron will not make or break this company. They do not rely in its success to make them profitable. They could stop development today and still be profitable in the future due to the way they have positioned themselves in the industry through their space system business segments. This type of position is going to be huge in the future as more people move their business into space.

I have followed this company for 3 years and they continue to impress me. Though launch is a very exciting part of this business, since it is really the only one we can see, I encourage every investor here to start viewing this company as an all around space company instead of just a launch company.

FAQ for RKLB For new WSB people (fixed) thanks chatGPT,"**What do they sell?**  
Rockets, satellites, hardware, and software.

**How were they listed?**  
SPAC. They had a peak at $18.

**Who is the CEO?**  
Sir Peter Beck.

**Wait, the CEO is knighted?**  
Yes, he's a New Zealander.

**Wait, the CEO of a significant aerospace company is a New Zealander?**  
Yeah, that's why it's unusual. It shows his intelligence in achieving something no one expected.

**Who are their competitors?**  
SpaceX, Blue Origin, Firefly, Stoke, and technically Astra.

**Wait, I only know two of those.**  
Two have never launched, and two haven't launched for ages.

**Wait, didn't one of those companies also get listed and then delisted?**  
Astra did that, and Virgin Orbit too, until they filed for Chapter 11.

**Ok, cool. What are Rocket Lab's competitive advantages over SpaceX and Blue Origin?**  
With Electron, smaller satellites that need to be launched sooner and to closer locations can be cheaper and more profitable over time compared to delays.

**Wait, why does their revenue recognition change so often over quarters?**  
Revenue for launches can only be recognized at launch, with 90% paid by launch day.

**How many launches are needed on Electron per year to be profitable?**  
Around 21.

**Wait, they didn’t launch that many per year.**  
First, consider revenue recognition. Delays are primarily on the client side.

**What is Neutron?**  
A significant new rocket that can lift up to 13 metric tons.

**How much does R&D for this cost?**  
It's supposed to be around $300 million. It might cost more.

**Wait, that’s a lot.**  
Yes, but relatively speaking, it's cheap. The Falcon 9 cost around $390 million in 2011.

**When will it launch?**  
Mid next year.

**How far along are they in development?**  
They've tested the engine.

**What about their other business activities?**  
Are they doing recovery?  
Soon.

**I’m glad you asked about satellites and space systems. These are high-revenue lines, profiting under SolAero and Sinclair, and selling carbon composites.**

**What do those do?**  
Star trackers, ion propulsion, solar panels, separation systems, and solar panels.

**How did they acquire these companies?**  
M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions).

**Wait, that’s like shopping for companies?**  
Yes, it's hinted that they may buy something for a new constellation.

**Who are their customers?**  
NASA, DOD, Space Force, and commercial customers.

**Wait, the financial statements say they’ve got convertible notes.**  
Yes, they have debt that can become shares.

**Great, are there any cons?**  
Yes.

**What are they?**  
Risk of a launch failure, delays in Neutron, and onerous legislation.

**Ok, what’s the ticker?**  
RKLB.

**Is there anything else?**  
Yes, I recommend reading *When the Heavens Went on Sale* and watching *Wild Wild Space*, which discusses Rocket Lab, Astra, Planet Labs, and Firefly.",67,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1ewizrn/faq_for_rklb_for_new_wsb_people_fixed_thanks/

My thought process is. If launch/neutron announcement this or next week I’m pretty well covered. 

But if pipe unlockup becomes a thing ( I don’t personally think it’s going to be that bad at all) the November calls will easily rebound on what should be 2 or 3 launches to include CAPSTONE.

"Observation on Content Creators, especially Vince","First off, I want to acknowledge how much I appreciate the constant flow of content by our bigger RKLB Creators. I'm talking Dave G, Vince, Matt Money, ScottO.

I've noticed too that almost all of them are hungry for more shares. As time has gone on and we have traded down in this range, all of their collective research has only lead to them wanting more shares, even surpassing previous share count goals/targets. This has me extremely bullish that Creators doing a large amount of research haven't lost any hope.

With that being said, I want to give a shout out to Vince and also offer an apology. I used to be very critical of Vince, doubting his knowledge on the subject. It felt like he more yolo'ed into the stock and was being a permabull. Whether or not that was originally true or just my incorrect opinion, I think Vince has really grown his knowledge on RKLB. The sheer number of videos he puts put forces him to listen to, read, and gather information for us. I feel like the last few videos he has produced lately have also demonstrated that.

I was wondering what everyone else's opinions on our Creators are, since those are the faces of our community as we hope to grow in the years to come.",36,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1dw9a0h/observation_on_content_creators_especially_vince/

I'm no expert or super well read on that sector alone- but i know enough that they're integral to the production of space vehicles/satellites. So, in effect, they are core to the space domain in it's entirety. I wanted to poke the forum to see if anyone has ideas about whether Beck and adam  could potentially see value in bringing chip production in house. Then scaling it accordingly. Obviously they wouldnt be buying out big players, because advanced micro devices and space forge are among some current suppliers of chips, but perhaps smaller firms? If i put myself in their shoes, there is nooooo way that I don't see the value proposition of swallowing up that capability to increase my company's offerring amid growing commercial space applications. 
Doing so could potentially make RKLB an all too attractive ""go-to"" source for everything space. Then boom, management can leverage that later on for juicy margins.

I don't know much about this company hence why this is really a question to anyone who can correct me, but In case anyone isn't aware Redwire (NYSE: RDW) is a space infrastructure company (think satellite components such as solar arrays) that has a market cap of $190 million and expects 2023 revenue to be between $220 and $250 million, which is well within reach as of Q3 earnings and reflects solid growth.

For comparison RKLB has a market cap of 2.4 billion and did 236 million in the 12 months to September 2023.

Huge component of the business not yet factored into share price,"I wanted to point out something that others have mentioned before, particularly Vince is Bullish:

Peter Beck has said more than once that Rocket Lab is aiming to launch 50% of their rockets for customers and 50% of their rockets for themselves. This is because one of the primary purposes of their business is to create some sort of space infrastructure akin to SpaceX’s Starlink - some type of constellation that provides a service with high value for customers and high profit margins for Rocket Lab.

SpaceX’s valuation ballooned (almost doubled) to $200B since Starlink has come online.

When ASTS simply mentioned their constellation contract with AT&T, their market cap 10x’d in 3 months (before they had put anything into space).

Rocket Lab is fully vertically integrated (ASTS had to use a SpaceX rocket to get their first 5 satellites for AT&T into orbit). Once Rocket Lab is ready to begin building their own constellation, they’ll be able to do it at significantly lower cost than ASTS.

The only reason Rocket Lab’s price hasn’t moved on these repeated announcements of Peter Beck’s 50/50 plan for the company is that they haven’t announced exactly what their constellation will be yet.

But anyone that knows this company can pretty safely assume it’ll be a success that drives huge profits.

Remember, ASTS moved 10x on news of a constellation. Rocket Lab has announced a constellation too but there’s been zero movement (recent movement is due to other reasons like Neutron progress and price upgrades).

Once they announce the purpose of their constellation and provide a roadmap with more details, the stock could easily 2-5x in a handful of months. This will almost certainly occur simultaneously with the first successful flight of neutron or shortly after (6-12 months).

Rocket lab becomes the next Orbital Sciences,"Full disclosure: was a shareholder of orbital sciences and am currently a shareholder in RKLB.

I am assuming that the most likely outcome for Rklb is similar to the trajectory taken by Orbital Sciences (OA). OA was purchased by Northrop in 2018 for $9B. Below are some of the similarities between the two. 

OA was founded as a novel commercial entry focused on distribution of the legacy space primes. 

OA developed a novel airborne launch vehicle called Pegasus that carried 443kg to LEO. Claimed as the first commercial developed launch vehicle. Parallels can be drawn between  Pegasus and Electron and their shared market niches (payload, novel commercial small launcher, support from DoD) . Obviously Electron has found product market fit far superior to Pegasus and is far cheaper but the parallels persist nonetheless. 

OA purchased Fairchild Industries, GDAIS and CTA to strengthen its position in satellite manufacturing similar to rational behind RKLB acquisitions of Sinclair, Plantery Systems, ASI, and SolAero. 

OA built the Dawn mission for NASA similar to RKLB and Escapade/Capstone.

OA built 150+ satellites to various government and commercial customers. 

OA developed the Antares launch vehicle that launched out of Wallops. Neutron has a similar payload and will launch a couple miles down the road. 

If Rklb follows the trajectory of OA then they will merge with another defense contractor (OA merged with ATK to strengthen its capabilities in solid rocket motors). I would venture that Rklb will eventually merge with a company like Kratos or Andriul.

Order backlog is DECREASING for three straight quarters,"I am optimistic about the company, but it is my duty as a Rocket Lab investor to call out information that does not fit into bullish narratives lest this community turn into an echo chamber.

Rocket Lab tries their best to downplay this but if you look at the [earnings presentations](https://investors.rocketlabusa.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx), you can see that the order backlog has decreased for three straight quarters. Clearly, Rocket Lab is still signing new contracts, but there are more contracts going out of the backlog than coming in.

Does anyone find this concerning? Rocket Lab's growth plan calls for rapid year-over-year revenue growth, which requires a lot of new contracts coming to the backlog. This is not happening.

How to accelerate Rocket Lab's growth,"Rocket Lab has correctly positioned itself as a vertically-integrated player in the rapidly growing New Space economy. From components to systems, spacecraft, constellations, and through to launch, on-orbit operations, and space-based application solutions, Rocket Lab has built up the capability to “do what it says it’s going to do.” More importantly, as it has built up these capabilities, it’s done so with a success rate that approaches 100%. Rocket Lab does not fail, or at least hasn’t failed so far. As Beck is heard to say in Wild Wild Space, ""I’m not built to build shit.”

Yet there are tradeoffs to be made between organic growth and growth gained through acquisitions. Yes, building up capabilities in-house at a place like Rocket Lab ensures that the results meet and often exceed immediate and long-term requirements. Whereas the challenges of an acquisition include cultural fit and other integration challenges as well as inevitable product evolution to meet internal requirements. The biggest expense of internal development is the opportunity cost. Though an acquisition costs actual cash, you’re buying a capability that’s closer to market already.

While Rocket Lab has **capabilities**, it has limited **capacity**. The New Space economy is growing so fast that Rocket Lab doesn’t have enough time to hire the number of top-flight team members needed to grow their business from the inside. But the company’s anemic market cap makes it nearly impossible to acquire top-flight technologies to keep up with requirements, opportunities, and capacity.

As I see it, there are 4 possible scenarios that will allow the company to optimize growth and fully realize its potential:

1. The market must respond to Rocket Lab’s potential to such an extent that the market cap grows by multiples.
2. An outside equity investor must be found to invest $1 billion or more to fund acquisitions, but diluting existing investors in the process.
3. Rocket Lab must merge or even be acquired by another company with compatible capabilities/capacity and access to significant capital.
4. Rocket Lab can continue to grow organically with the opportunities and challenges it currently faces.

The market may give greater recognition to Rocket Lab once Neutron reaches orbit. But the stated scale up of launch cadence is incremental, spanning several years before it can deploy a constellation like the Falcon 9 is doing for StarLink. Even with a 70% annual growth rate, it’ll take many years to reach the scale implied by Peter Beck’s vision.

Advice to small investors on RKLB - Stay away from buying options for a while.,"This is an advice to small investors who are entering the market from an experienced investor who did lose money playing options.

Options are very tempting at the moment given the run RKLB had this quarter. Every stock will have pullback. When it does, time value eat away potential profits.

Your best bet through earnings is to buy the stock and sell out of the money covered calls for November end. The money you make from the covered calls, you can put it back into RKLB to increase your share count. Don't despair if your options are called. Do it again.

Consider buying options when RSI goes below 40 and MACDs are in negative territory. This is where technical analysis will help you.

If the options you bought are expiring worthless, you giving free money to whales. A $1000 from you pocket may not seem much. But a hundred players like yourself giving free money to whales every week is Big Whale Money.

Will RKLB's share price double this year? - Re-revisiting my post from 2024/04/29,"Today, on 2024/08/16, RKLB reached $7.10, more than doubling from its YTD low of $3.47 on 2024/04/16. Hell yeah!

  
[My old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cfjtco/will_rklbs_share_price_double_this_year/) from 2024/04/29 follows below:

RKLB share price has a history of doubling from its low during the summer and then falling down to repeat the process next year. So far, it has happened every and each year since its listing on the stock market:

* **2021: $9.5 to $21.34 from 2021/08/27 to 2021/09/09**
* **2022: $3.53 to $7.15 from 2022/06/30 to 2022/08/12**
* **2023:** **$3.76 to $8.05 from 2023/05/09 to 2023/07/19**

The 2024 low has been reached on 2024/4/16 at $3.47. What has changed from previous years besides the company's increased performance is that **the reported short interest YTD has increased by 161% from 22m to 58m shorted shares**. This huge increase right before the summer may cause a bound of a violent volatility once the 2024 doubling commences.

RKLB trades so cheaply and it is so heavily shorted that all that may be needed to revalue its stock is a shift in sentiment. Right now the stock is pricing in the most bearish of bearish outcomes. Delayed Neutron development, increased R&D costs and Electron's obsolescence. But Rocket Lab is the only space company dedicated to being a one stop shop for space applications. Suppose over this year, the management can craft a narrative that Neutron is really coming this year/early next year and with it a significant decrease in R&D costs and the growth and capture of launch and space system markets. Such sentiment shift may take time but I don't know, there are so many unusual factors with Rocket Lab that I could see it happening rapidly.

I am not betting that Rocket Lab is going to stage the most epic growth of all time. I am just betting on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06).
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year.

SpaceX Raptor Development timeline,"I summarized the Wikipedia article for the Raptor development timeline- so we can estimate more accurately where Rocket Lab is right now with Archimedes.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor#

Keep in mind:
- SpaceX was the far more experienced (and financially capable) company during Raptor development. Falcon9 was already launching reliably during that time and SpaceX was able financially to try several approaches at once and save time
- the raptor full flow stage combustion combustion cycle is far more complicated than RocketLabs oxygen rich staged combustion cycle + SpaceX aimed for 3x the thrust for a similarly sized engine.
- SpaceX had access to the E2 test stand at Stennis. That test stand is capable of supplying high pressure, high temperature fuel/oxygen/nitrogen to test individual components of a staged combustion engine. Beck was arguing that they could not test most of the components beforehand and will have to the test the whole system at once- let‘s hope that works out.

Will RKLB's share price double this year? - Revisiting my post from 2024/04/29,"My old post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cfjtco/will_rklbs_share_price_double_this_year/) and I'll re-post its text below. RLKB closed that day at $3.80. Today, it closed at $5.33.

My thesis was that RKLB has doubled from lows each year since its SPAC IPO and that 2024 will be no different in this regard. I've bet on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil. - this holds true at the current valuation.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06). - this was true and we're now expecting much higher Q2 revenues (+30% QoQ) and another doubling of the backlog.
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars. - this still holds true, the demand for Electron was confirmed by the Synspective's order of 10 Electron launches and app. 7 HASTE launches between 2024 and 2025.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year. - Neutron will not launch this year but Kuiper satellites are still scheduled for the launch in the second half of this year.

My thesis is still intact. Even though it is too early to do the victory lap, RKLB is now mere 30% away from doubling since its all time lows and there are many catalysts on the horizon. For example, the upcoming Archie hot-fire test (I love that Archimedes' nickname), Ashlee Vance's Wild Wild Space documentary on HBO MAX, the common run up to the earnings report and, of course, the FOMC cutting the rates this year.

Let me know your opinion.

[My post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cfjtco/will_rklbs_share_price_double_this_year/) from 2024/04/29:

RKLB share price has a history of doubling from its low during the summer and then falling down to repeat the process next year. So far, it has happened every and each year since its listing on the stock market:

* **2021: $9.5 to $21.34 from 2021/08/27 to 2021/09/09**
* **2022: $3.53 to $7.15 from 2022/06/30 to 2022/08/12**
* **2023:** **$3.76 to $8.05 from 2023/05/09 to 2023/07/19**

The 2024 low has been reached on 2024/4/16 at $3.47. What has changed from previous years besides the company's increased performance is that **the reported short interest YTD has increased by 161% from 22m to 58m shorted shares**. This huge increase right before the summer may cause a bound of a violent volatility once the 2024 doubling commences.

RKLB trades so cheaply and it is so heavily shorted that all that may be needed to revalue its stock is a shift in sentiment. Right now the stock is pricing in the most bearish of bearish outcomes. Delayed Neutron development, increased R&D costs and Electron's obsolescence. But Rocket Lab is the only space company dedicated to being a one stop shop for space applications. Suppose over this year, the management can craft a narrative that Neutron is really coming this year/early next year and with it a significant decrease in R&D costs and the growth and capture of launch and space system markets. Such sentiment shift may take time but I don't know, there are so many unusual factors with Rocket Lab that I could see it happening rapidly.

I am not betting that Rocket Lab is going to stage the most epic growth of all time. I am just betting on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06).
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year.

Using the 'Rule of 40' to sanity check the valuation of RKLB,"In a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/q42g9y/applying_the_rule_of_40_to_rklb/), I applied the Rule of 40 to assess the growth potential of RKLB.  The R40 is a great tool to help you wrap your head around the exponential growth potential of a stock.  The R40 principle states that a company’s combined sales growth rate and profit margin should be at least 40%, and ideally better.

     Rule of 40 = Revenue Growth Rate + Profit Margin

In his book *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, Daniel Kahneman demonstrates how intuitively bad humans are at statistics, and I think exponential growth is a great example of this; just look at how shocking it is when a handful of Covid cases turn into millions.

The valuations of growth stocks must be pricing in exponential revenue growth - otherwise how does a company like RKLB with $54M of annual revenue command a market capitalization of $6,600M?

The R40 is handy little rule of thumb, a score of 40 or more tells you that revenues are growing exponentially with doubling time of circa two years or less.  Assuming profits are reinvested for growth.  But how do we decide if that is sufficient to justify the market capitalization?

I've put together a formula that attempts to provide a framework for answering that question. This formula allows investors to judge how many years they think is sensible for RKLB to become a mature company, and what the would take in terms of R40 between now and then.  For now, let's define some terms:

    i = Initial Annual Revenue = $54M (estimate for 2021)
    c = Market Capitalization = $6600M
    m = S&P 500 Average Price to Sales Ratio = 3.15
    t = Target Annual Revenue = c / m = $2095M

If RKLB was a mature company, you might expect it's revenue to be in line with the price to sales ratio of the wider market.  So for a $6600M company, that would be an annual revenue of $2095M.  A little over $2B. My formula, tells you the R40 required to achieve the Target Annual Revenue within Y years:

|Years to Target Annual Revenue (Y)|R40 Required|
|:-|:-|
|1|3780|
|2|523|
|3|239|
|4|150|
|5|108|
|6|84|
|7|69|
|8|58|
|9|50|
|10|44|
|11|39|
|12|36|

So for RLKB to achieve \~$2B annual revenue inside one year, they would need an R40 of 3780.  That's obviously not going to happen.  As per my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/q42g9y/applying_the_rule_of_40_to_rklb/), RKLB's R40 next year is forecast to be 199.  IF, they could maintain that level of growth, they would get to $2B in around 3-4 years.  But that is spectacular growth, perhaps they are unlikely to be able to sustain that level for very long.  On the other hand, maybe they will.

If we assume that an R40 of 40 is achievable over the medium term, then RKLB will get to the revenue target in about 10-11 years.  I think that's pessimistic personally, given that next year their R40 is forecast to be 199.  Based on current estimates, I suspect Y will fall somewhere between those two extremes.

The main conclusion that I draw from this analysis, is that new revenue streams are everything when valuing a speculative growth company.  Not so much because a $24M contract is great in and of itself, but because of what it suggests about the rate of growth and how long it might take to be generating substantial revenues.

I think this analysis is worth keeping up to date, because new revenue streams can massively affect the time we estimate that it takes RKLB to achieve substantial revenue flows.  Those financial updates will be critical.  If the revenue pipeline really starts to fill up, then the valuation looks increasingly cheap.  If growth proves elusive, the valuation starts to look expensive.  At this stage, we really are speculating - but I personally have faith RKLB will deliver excellent R40.

I arrived at the formula by starting with the exponential growth function, and rearranging the formula to make the growth rate the subject of the formula, expressed as a percentage value (as the R40 is).  Here is the formula in case anyone wants to check my workings or use it themselves.

    i = Initial Annual Revenue
    t = Target Annual Revenue
    r = Growth Rate
    R = Rule of 40
    Y = Number of Years
    c = Market Capitalization = $6600M
    m = S&P 500 Average Price to Sales Ratio = 3.15
    
    t = i(1+r)^Y
    t/i = (1+r)^Y
    (t/i)^(1/Y) = 1+r
    (t/i)^(1/Y) = 1+(R/100)
    R = 100(((t/i)^(1/Y)) - 1)
    
    t = c / m
    
    R = 100((((c/m)/i)^(1/Y)) - 1)

I'm confident the formula works, because if you take any value of R40 from the table above, and grow the Initial Annual Revenue of $54M by that figure Y number of times, you arrive at the Target Annual Revenue of $2095M, rounding errors aside.  But I welcome the community to check my workings.

**TLDR** \- the *rate* of revenue growth is everything when valuing speculative growth stocks, as their valuation basically prices in exponential revenue growth.  Any significant updates to revenue forecasts will dramatically affect the valuation and therefore the stock price.",21,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/q5bwrn/using_the_rule_of_40_to_sanity_check_the/

Valuation ,"I keep seeing comments that RKLB is cheap and SpaceX is overvalued. Or other commentary that sounds like it is based on faith and not thought out metrics. Full disclosure I'm bullish on both. 

Morgan Stanley has probably one of the most publicly available in-depth analysis of SpaceX value. They note that 60% of the value is in Starlink. That would make SpaceX rocket side about a $75B valuation. Given their launch revenue was estimated to be $5.5B for 2024 that is a revenue multiplier of 13.6x. Apply that to Rocket lab and you get a valuation of $10b on $245m of revenue and you have a revenue multiplier of 40.8x. 

RocketLab's launch business is three times more expensive to buy than SpaceX's right now. Not sure SpaceX is overvalued (on launch).  Starship is arguably a much bigger leap than Neutron (new model vs providing a launch alternative to existing model). So, not sure how SpaceX can be called overvalued and at the same time saying RocketLab has room for another 150% gain ($50 share).

If this is correct (and it was quick and sort price analysis), does RKLB benefit from IPO access and demand for the sector that cannot be easily accessed via SpaceX? Is there something else driving the multiplier difference? Yes both companies do more than launch, but one has turned that into revenue while the other is just starting down that path. And that portion of the valuation is pulled out of SpaceX in the above analysis and assumed to be $0 for RKLB. 

Maybe that's the difference. That the market is already valuing the non-launch business at even more astronomical multipliers than SpaceX's non-launch business.",62,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1gs6fmx/valuation/
Trading vs Investing. Why not both?,"First off, I’m long.  Way long.  I truly believe this company has the chops and the vision to go far in the burgeoning private Space Market.  I (43yo) plan to hold this stock and build my position until retirement and or beyond. 

Many of us have been in this since the SPAC days or shortly after and have been averaging down since then.   I personally am at a CB of $5.64 as of today.

I feel that if we spike again like we did in August of last year I might take profits and wait to buy back.   The modest (yet notable) gains of selling could create an opportunity to get more shares than if I just keep buying when the day job allows should the price drop again.

The fluctuations of this past year have been massive in terms of percentages.  A savvy trader could have made mad money on the constant 5-30% moves and still be holding a nice position.

As I see it, until Neutron launches, RKLB isn’t getting back to $10 let alone the $20+ it hit during the wackadoo days of COVID fed SPAC/meme stock mania. 

I’m looking at $6.50 as a momentary exit point and would buy back anywhere below $5.

Could Electron launch from a UK Spaceport in Scotland?,"I know it's an old article from 2018, but I never realised that RL was at one point evaluating launching the Electron from Scotland to give them an opportunity to launch European satellites. Could they consider this in the future or is it dead before it even started.

Rocket Lab said in a statement late Monday that it is “evaluating launch opportunities” from the Sutherland spaceport in Scotland.

“Electron is well-positioned to be the first orbital rocket launched from U.K. soil,” said Peter Beck, Rocket Lab’s founder and CEO. “We’re excited to review the opportunity to develop a launch service to support the U.K. space industry’s growth.

“Every aspect of Rocket Lab’s launch model is designed to offer rapid, repeatable and precise delivery to orbit for small satellites,” Beck said in a statement. “The development of launch sites around the globe that can support Electron launches is crucial to delivering unprecedented access to orbit.”",14,16,https://spaceflightnow.com/2018/07/16/scotland-site-selected-as-launch-base-for-lockheed-martin-orbex/

How would a space race affect Rocket Lab,"Hi, I have 3 questions. 

1) What is the likelihood of a new space race, likely between the US and China?

2) How would this impact the stock price? 
-Would it lead to increased budget and contracts for space companies like RKLB, or would the gov backtrack on the privatization of the space industry as a result? 
-Would this pump the stock price out of patriotism? Dumb question but who knows. 

3) Do you think a space race will be useful to society in accelerating the development of space, and new technology which may trickle down to us? Or will it be based around gaining and gatekeeping a military advantage. 

Idk if this is a dumb or irrelevant question, but in the absence of any real news about the company, I figured it could be an interesting topic to ponder over.

Vulcan Delay > Rocket Lab Impact.,"So here are some facts

1. Vulcan upperstage needs redesigning and testing. Which will cause a delay of Vulcan Test Flight atleast untill Q1 2024

2. Kuijper test sats were planned to launch on Vulcan Test Flight. 

3. Rocketlab can not announce a deal of 250million worth of reaction wheels before the test sats of that consolation (probably amazon) are launched.

Here is some bad news speculation based on these facts. Feel free to challenge me on this!

- If Amazon is part of the new deal and they decide to wait for Vulcan. It will probably mean a delay to manufacturing and launching the constellation. If this is the case it would most definitely mean Rocket Lab will not see any revenue from those reaction wheels before and probably also not during Q1 2024. Some extra risks will be : further delays and cost of maintaining factory without production.

Question : What are the choices for Amazon to launch on a different launch vehicle for their test sats?

Here is some potential good news.

- Some people have already suggested a delay in Vulcan could mean Neutron would be a logical choice to launch Kuijper Sats. If Rocket Lab deliverers on time, have a successful test flight and could get a cadence in quick. Which on every count would be world-class as far as I am concerned. Either way in my opinion Neutron would be fully booked for a long time. 

I also want to nuance something about Rocket Lab abilities with Electron and the upcoming Neutron cadence. If your look at any modern space company. SpaceX and Rocket Lab are the only ones who have achieved a good cadence. Note they both only achieved it with one rocket system (Electron/Haste and F9/FH). I think with the experience they have with scaling a launch cadence. It will make it easier to get to a good launch cadence quicker with Neutron and Starship. If you look at Starship, if it weren’t for the pad. The next one would have launch already. So just wanted to let you guys think about that.

Thoughts on share price and revenue based valuation,"-----I don't mean to spread FUD or intend this post to call out the stock, I genuinely want to stimulate conversation regarding  RKLB fair valuation vs other similar companies-----

My background is in VC, mostly early stage but I am familiar with late stage as well, although RKLB is still far from profitable and therefore not as late stage as being a publicly traded company would suggest.   

Hardware/space companies which are pre profit, but show great promise, as RKLB does, typically are valued at 3-10x revenue, depending on how close they are to profitability. From the last earnings report, Rocket Lab earned $40.7m USD in Q1,2022. Extrapolated out to a full year, this is $168.2mUSD. if we take 3-10x revenue to valuation multiple, we get a company value of around 0.5-1.6B USD. That equates to a share price of between $1-3.4USD. That is still well below the current share price of $4 even in the optimistic end. Rklb are currently at a revenue to valuation multiple of 12x. 

Planet Labs is a good space company to compare to. They have similar revenue ($40.1mUSD in Q1,2022), are much closer to profitability, are also arguably a very promising company, but are only at a revenue multiple if 8.5. 

I'm interested to hear from y'all why such a high revenue multiple is apparently justified for RKLB compared to similar companies, especially when they are much further from profitability?

In response to the bears (aka the liberal arts bull case for RKLB),"A few days ago I had an exchange with a guy who posted various pics Archimedes vs Raptor rockets.   A link to the thread ( https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/s/HOahYRJsur ), but the guy’s comments were deleted either by himself or the mods(?).  

In any event, it started out as just one of any number of posts going on about space x being so far ahead that nobody can compete.  I think the poster was a provocateur but also argued in good faith.  I found him to be broadly representative of a demographic of investor whose biases (technical snobbery and industry experience) are commonly found in arguments against Rocket Lab.  I think that those points are worth further discussion. 

I’m NOT an engineer (and this poster snidely pointed this out, in response to my comment that I don’t care about Archimedes looking like a wiry mess compared to Raptor).  I’m also not a quant of any type.  I focus on soft factors - culture, broad market structure, political and social movements.  I am a liberal arts shit head investor, and am proud to be one.  I was on NVIDIA in early 2022 (after many techies, yes,  but still before the market as a whole) because I read some novels about AI and read about GPT 3.  Not to toot my own horn, but focusing on soft factors like “how will other people perceive this technology?” and “where are the potential bottlenecks in developing it?” and “what companies are critical to this but have relatively low overall public awareness?” were critical to pointing me to Nvidia.  Much of the same analysis points me to Rocket Lab.

“Rocket Lab is technically inferior to Space X”.  Nobody disputes this. I take it as a given.  There is a wide gulf.  But does it matter?  Only if the technological gap cannot be overcome in the long run.  Why would Space X have an insurmountable technological moat?  It could only be one of three reasons:

1. The tech is too hard to replicate
2. The talent for developing the tech will only be at Space X
3. Space X will drive its competitors out of business before they can attain technological parity. 

As to 1, this is not true.  Saturn V rockets have existed for like 50 years.  Building rockets is hard but it does not require any significant breakthrough in fundamental science to match Space X.  I think this is not controversial.  It’s a question of scaling, money, processes, quality control, not fundamental scientific knowledge. 

As to 2: the commenter argued something to the effect that given space X’s advantage, no engineer would want to work for RKLB. This , frankly , struck me as prime Boomer Logic.  We have seen time and again that top talent wants to take risks and get exposure to upside.  Yes many engineers like to work for a more established company, but many will simply want the challenge, glory, and financial rewards associated with working for start up (or in RKLBs case, a mature start up with room to run).  

As to 3: Beck himself often rightly points out that monopolies usually do not last in the long run.  While this is less true in extremely capital intensive industries , he is generally correct and his point is buttressed by 2 additional facts.  A) space is a national security issue and B) Space X is and must remain a privately held company ( if it is to continue to pursue its mars goal).

I asked the poster to tell me who controlled airplane manufacturing during World War 2.  He responded a small number of companies incestuously subcontracted with each other and later consolidated into a handful of mega contractors due to government intervention. He made my point for me.  Vital national defense concerns are never run by pure monopoly; oligopoly is the rule.  This is because the market is artificial.  The government cannot tolerate a single company having a chokehold on vital capacity such as launch and space systems manufacture.  It requires somewhat competitive bidding.  It requires redundancies.  It also requires its contractors to satisfy national security laws regarding sourcing, supply chain, secrecy, clearances, etc.  Rocket Lab has come farther than any of its direct competitors (other than, obviously, Space X) in terms of being able to satisfy the governments requirements and delivering a product that works as advertised.  At minimum, Rocket Lab can deliver components for other launch providers ; the best case is that it can be one of 3-4 major government contractors in terms of taking payloads into orbit. 

The private vs public structure is also quite important.  Public companies are subject to disclosure laws that do not apply to private companies.  Control is dispersed, not concentrated in one person or small group.  This is a superior governance structure for the purposes of winning public confidence and political support.  Space X cannot go public in the near term because its stated goal of going to Mars will be severely compromised by introducing any form of outside governance.  I do take Musk at his word; mars is THE objective. Thus, it must remain in the hands of an idiosyncratic billionaire with many political enemies.  All the more reason for US and world governments to foster competition and incubate alternatives. 

None of this is to say that rocket lab will come out as one of the favored group of competitors- it is still a long, hard road with a lot of risk.  But I do not buy the thesis that SpaceX is untouchable and I do believe that RKLB is one of the top contenders.",104,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1g8mmdo/in_response_to_the_bears_aka_the_liberal_arts/

Conversion price determination,"I'm pretty happy with the 300M financing, especially seeing the 4.250% interest rate they got. Much lower interest than the previous loan, and an even more solid cash position. The deal is complex, but seems well explained in this comment https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1ahgilo/article_on_share_offering/kooqygq/ 

What I'm not so happy with is the way conversion price for the deal was determined. The conversion price (and the capped call strike price) was based on the stock price at close on Feb 1.

The price ended up at $4.02, down more than 17% from $4.85 at close the previous day. That's 17% extra dilution in 2027 if the stock goes up past the conversion price. Also, dilution becomes much more likely!

I think that is pretty messed up. Why not go for a conversion price based on stock price average over a period? And why would the point in time be just after partial details of the deal was announced, causing the stock price to crash?
The crash in the stock price was pretty predictable. 

Also, the deal put RKLB in a position where every institutional lender taking part in the deal would know about the conversion price determination time, and have a massive incentive to push the stock price down as low as possible on close Feb 1.

A revelation I’ve come to realise,"One of the biggest unknowns we’ve had about Neutrons commercial success, is how well it will actually compete with Falcon 9. I for example, have always been hopeful, but a bit unsure about the fact that Neutron can only put 13 Tons into LEO in reusable configuration, compared to a much higher offering from Falcon 9.

Until the penny dropped that Falcon 9 is a mature design that’s been in production and service for well over a decade, and has seen many iterations and evolutions over it’s life.

I searched it up, Falcon 9s first ever iteration “v1.0” could only put 9 tonnes into LEO, and it wasn’t reusable. The second iteration “v1.1” could put 13 tonnes into LEO, and wasn’t reusable. It wasn’t until v1.2 came about in 2015 that it could then put 18.5 tons into LEO in reusable configuration and 22.8 Tons into LEO as an expendable rocket. It then later got refined into its next iteration “Block 5”, but it’s payload capacity stayed the same, and the en you’ve got Falcon Heavy which obviously has the higher capacities again.

So when you compare this to Neutron, it’s starting out brilliantly already. Considering Neutron is a foetus and Falcon 9 is a fully matured vehicle by now, and even so, F9 in its current state can only put 5.5 more tons into orbit than Neutron can (with both in LEO reusable configuration respectively). 

It’s safe to assume that as Neutron and Archimedes go through the development process and receive updates/iterations as it goes through its life and matures, that Neutron will be a very strong contender to Falcon 9. I mean, we already know that Archimedes in it’s current stage of life, will be operated at pretty low stress levels. And even at low stress levels, it’s starting considerably further ahead than where Falcon 9 started its life. Over the years of neutron being in service, when Rocket Lab refine and improve on their base design of neutron, when they learn more about Archimedes and how far they can push it whilst still being reliable to launch again and again and again, it seems safe to assume that Neutrons payload capacity will see decent payload improvements.

But my main point to realise is that Neutron is starting its life, leaps and bounds ahead of where Falcon 9 started its life, in terms of payload capacity and the fact that it will be reusable right from the outset. Obviously, this isn’t all down to Peter Beck masterclass, it’s been over a decade since F9 came to life, and technology has moved on since then. Still though, with this in mind, I feel a lot more confident about the argument of “How will Neutron compete with Falcon 9”. 

Will we see a neutron heavy? I doubt it but I’d love to be proven wrong in 5-10 years time. But with this in mind, not even taking into account that certain clients may pick rocket lab purely because it’s the only option that isn’t Elon Musk, AND the fact that Rocket Lab will offer end to end space services unlike SpaceX, AND the fact that Rocket Lab missions are tailored to their customers better and have a more precise orbit insertion, I think it’s pretty reasonable to assume that Neutron will at the very least, give Falcon 9 a good run for their money. 

The only thing that does still worry me slightly is that Falcon 9 has more than paid off for it’s self by now, so SpaceX will be able to price gouge/undercut Rocket Lab as much as they want (within reason), and Rocket Lab can only lower their prices so far to match it, after all, they have years of neutron service ahead of them to pay off the development costs.",58,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fttb0l/a_revelation_ive_come_to_realise/
Why I think RKLB is a hold ,"I'm seeing a lot of new people popping up in this sub talking about gainz for ants. Y'all shortsighted motherfuckers. Look at the macro picture: 

1. US/China space race heating up. China is seen as a ""pacing challenge"" by the US military. Last time this shit happened during the Cold War, NASA spending reached 4.5% of federal budget. 

2. NO to monopoly. National security shit is not allowed to have a monopoly. Spacex will never be the only player. And it's valued at 200 bil, almost 50x what rklb is worth.

3. The huge TAM of space services in general. Lunar exploration, mars, LEO sats, spy sats, LEO experimental medicine, low gravity manufacturing etc. A lot of it is speculative you say? Well that's what investing in tech is about aye? You're looking for the NEXT BIG THING, not the last big thing. You might as well do GEICO and Coca Cola if you're of that bent. 

4. Actual working rocket and workable path to another big ass rocket. How many other companies you know put their money where their mouth is and can execute to a high level.

6. Improving macro environment. Last time we had a massive reduction in rates after 08, there's a boom for 10 years. 2011 to 2021 were some of the best times in the market. Now with lower rates, you bet your ass the rotation into small and mid caps is gonna happen. Not least because lower rates make capital raising and debt obligations a lot more manageable.

Pipe lockup,"So recent analyst upgrades have hinted at the potential for S1 being filed this week unlocking the pipe shares. I did some digging and I “think” they are required by the merger agreements to file an S-1 by 30 days post merger, however are locked by the 6 month lockup agreement to actually sell. I need someone smarter than me to pick this apart however. Here are the legal snippets from the merger agreement I got from digging around the 8K.

From the business combination proposals section of the merger agreement.

	
“Lock-up. Rocket Lab stockholder who enter into the Second Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement will agree not to transfer their shares of New Rocket Lab Common Stock received in the Business Combination for 180 days following the Closing Date, other than pursuant to specified permitted transfers”

Okay so maybe the pipe didn’t enter the second amended and restated registration rights agreement (I can’t seem to find if they did) however there is also this…

“Rocket Lab Stockholder Support Agreements
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain stockholders of Rocket Lab representing the requisite votes necessary to approve the Business Combination entered into support agreements (the “Rocket Lab Stockholder Support Agreements”) with Vector, pursuant to which each such holder agreed to (i) vote at any meeting of Rocket Lab’s stockholders, and in any action by written consent of Rocket Lab’s stockholders, all of its Rocket Lab equity securities in favor of the adoption and approval of the Charter Amendment, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Mergers; (ii) be bound by certain other covenants and agreements related to the Business Combination; and (iii) be bound by certain transfer restrictions with respect to such securities, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Rocket Lab Stockholder Support Agreements.

Lock-up Arrangements
In connection with the Closing, certain Rocket Lab stockholders who entered into Rocket Lab Stockholder Support Agreements (as described above), will enter into a lockup agreement with Vector pursuant to which they will agree not to transfer their New Rocket Lab Common Stock for six months following the closing of the Business Combination; provided that the lockup agreement will not apply to Rocket Lab stockholders who enter in the Second Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement and become subject to the lock-up provisions thereof. In addition, Sponsor has agreed not to transfer its shares of New Rocket Lab Common Stock received in connection with the Business Combination until the earliest of (a) one year after the closing of the Business Combination and (b) subsequent to closing, (x) if the closing price of the New Rocket Lab Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after Closing or (y) the date on which New Rocket Lab completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of its public stockholders having the right to exchange their common stock for cash, securities or other property.”

Only the strong survive… the great SPAC attack of 2019,"The year is 2019… 

Virgin Galactic merges with SCH to create SPCE, ushering in a new age of retail space investing…

Virgin Galactic, rooted in the genius of legendary aerospace designer Burt Rutan and Scaled Composites, becomes a public company via Richard Branson…

Virgin Galactic promises a bright future for future space tourists and investors. 

Branson would later take small satellite launcher, Virgin Orbit (VORB), public via merger with NextGen Acquisition Corp. 

Virgin Orbit wants it all. 

On September 25, 2020… Vector Acquisition Corp goes public. 

On August 25, 2021,… a young, fledgling space startup company founded by rocket bike connoisseur, New Zealander, gold-prospector, and cabbage patch look-alike, Peter Beck, merges with VACQ.

Rocket Lab enters the commercial space race as a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ. But legacy space and defense contractors dismiss RocketLab’s Electron rocket as too small for doing serious rocketry. 

It is early 2023…

After a global pandemic and nuclear winter for raising capital, the shakeout is in full swing. Space launch startups like Astra, Relativity, and Branson’s Virgin Orbit are teetering on the brink.  Claims of large 2B backlogs and realities of horizontal flying rockets will not save them from impending doom. 

On April 4, 2023, Branson’s Virgin Orbit files for bankruptcy, crushing hopes of a free satellite launching future not dominated by old school contractors and the SpaceX monopoly. 

The demand for satellite constellations and real-time global connectivity grows. 

It is June 20th 2024…

Rocket Lab successfully launches its 50th Electron mission, the fastest rocket to do so. Rocket Lab is also in full swing developing its medium lift Neutron rocket. 

It is August, 2024…

The archimedes engine breathes fire. People are skeptical of Neutron’s new engine, calling bullshit on Peter Beck for not releasing a long video of a hot fire.   

However, Peter Beck confirms a hot fire later in the month.  

The industry is put on check.

It is November 12, 2024…

In the Q3 earnings call, Peter Beck confirms Neutron is open for business. The first Neutron contract for a constellation operator has been confirmed. 

Will the future of affordable access to space and constellation building be dominated purely by the Falcon 9, Starship, Elon, and SpaceX????? ",45,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1gqxoqp/only_the_strong_survive_the_great_spac_attack_of/
BlueOrigin: less than 10 days to produce 1 engine,"BlueOrigin CEO:  
  
“We’d like to \[be delivering\] about an engine a week by the end of the year. I’m not sure we’ll get exactly to a week, but it’ll be sub-10 days … \[and\] by the end of 2025, we have to be faster than that,” Limp said.

Tbh. that news is shocking. BlueOrigin spend billions of dollars and years of development (development started in 2011, was announced in 2014, first launch in January 2024) and right now they need 10 days to produce 1 engine?  
RocketLab started development of Archimedes in 2021, as a ox rich cycle in September 2022.  
We won't come by exact production numbers, but my educated guess is that they are currently producing about 1 engine per month.

In the Q2 earnings presentation they wrote that engine 2 were coming off the production line. 5 more were in production. And as Peter Beck wrote in context with the recent Archimedes video, engine number 3 already should fix the copper issue.

Diversifying in space stocks beyond RKLB,"Out of the main space stocks im aware of (RKLB, LUNR, ASTS, RDW), RKLB is my favorite but I have done some research on it and watched a lot of YouTube videos and it is currently about 50% of my portfolio. 

Wondering what you guys think about diversifying into other space stocks like the others I mentioned, to not have too much money invested in one company. 

If you do invest in other space stocks, what are they and why do you hold them instead of just adding to RKLB?

For my very little research in the other 3 companies, LUNR stands out to me as possibly being the one I would consider adding next, but if I did it would be a much smaller amount compared to RKLB. Maybe 1/20th-1/10th of the ammount I have in RKLB. 

Thank you for any input and ideas. ",95,194,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1h1qqrv/diversifying_in_space_stocks_beyond_rklb/
"Implied Volatility (IV) Skew for RKLB, unified for three approaching option expiration dates: August 2, August 9, and August 16","**Implied Volatility (IV):** IV is a measure of the market's forecast of a likely movement in a security's price. It often rises in bearish markets and falls in bullish markets, as higher IV corresponds to higher expected risk or uncertainty.

**IV Skew:** This shows the difference in IV across different strike prices for option contracts. Different IVs for different strikes reflects the market's expectations of the likelihood of different outcomes.

This skew is showing that the market is *positioning* and *hedging* for a large potential move up OR down within the coming weeks.

To be clear, this is to be taken with a grain of salt, the option chain is just one of many data inputs that investors should consider. But for what its worth, alongside the IV skew, **open interest** and **put/call volume** on the option chain are also quite bullish.

The cost of shipping a satellite to New Zealand,"I know rocket lab is setting up a launch pad in MD but they’ll have two pads in New Zealand. Any idea how expensive it is to ship a 200-300kg satellite to New Zealand?  Looking at the total cost might drive some companies away as they would have to cover shipping cost to NZ and risk damage on the journey. 
I love rocket lab but I’m concerned they are setting up launch pads essentially as far away as you can get from satellite manufacturers rather than perhaps coastal areas closer to the manufactures. 

Another thought I had was it is significantly easier to launch rockets closer to the equator as SpaceX now does in Boca Chica TX.  Most US launch pads are in the southern states to take advantage of being closer to the equator.  Where as rocket labs launch pads are about half way to the pole. 

I love the company and invest in it. Just thoughts I had on how they could become more cost competitive and make life easier on those rockets sending payloads into space.",16,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/rskev4/the_cost_of_shipping_a_satellite_to_new_zealand/

We know they have a huge back order of launches and they manufacturing a rocket per month and many of them are ready to go. 

We know their space systems side of the business will do well with more launches as well as many of those components will be on Rocket Lab electron launches.

So in summary, they got everything lined up to have a huge pent up demand for launches in 2022.  But they gotta deliver regular launches.

RKLB Share Price vs. Short Interest - Latest Update,"NASDAQ released the latest short interest in RKLB just a short while ago (dated 11/29/2024 when the SP was at the ATH of >$27).  Below is a graph showing plots of RKLB short interest (obtained from NASDAQ) overlaid with the corresponding day's share price (obtained from Fidelity) covering the previous 1 year and 15 days. The earnings call was the main driving force for the share price rocketing up.  Shorts were caught napping and they desperately had to scramble to cover their positions which probably drove the share price up even more to the new ATH of >$27. As a result, short interest decreased dramatically (\~20%) from the previous month. Short interest was still high at \~49.28 million shares short or \~13% of the float as of 11/29/2024. I think new shorts have since then opened new short positions (this is how shorts typically react after a massive price spike) and they’re heavily shorting the stock which is partially causing the downtrend in the share price.  The other reason for the downtrend in the share price is probably due to profit taking.  My thinking is that we will see share price consolidation in the $20 - 22 range at least in the near term.  What do y’all think?  Please share here.

When will ARKX get into RKLB?,"Cathie Wood's ARK offered ARKX, their ""Space Exploration and Innovation"" ETF shortly before VACQ took RKLB public. I thought for sure that the fund would load up on RKLB then. They even loosened their rules around purchasing SPACs while VACQ was still around, I was hopeful that this was to get in to RKLB while it was still a cheap $10. RKLB is the clearest play for publicly traded innovation in the space industry. But it's been over 6 months since RKLB went public, and ARKX still doesn't hold a single share. Now, like anyone in her job, Cathie Wood has been very correct and very incorrect in the past. I'm not here to discuss that.
