RKLB Share Price vs. Short Interest - Latest Update,"NASDAQ released the latest short interest in RKLB just a short while ago (dated 11/29/2024 when the SP was at the ATH of >$27).  Below is a graph showing plots of RKLB short interest (obtained from NASDAQ) overlaid with the corresponding day's share price (obtained from Fidelity) covering the previous 1 year and 15 days. The earnings call was the main driving force for the share price rocketing up.  Shorts were caught napping and they desperately had to scramble to cover their positions which probably drove the share price up even more to the new ATH of >$27. As a result, short interest decreased dramatically (\~20%) from the previous month. Short interest was still high at \~49.28 million shares short or \~13% of the float as of 11/29/2024. I think new shorts have since then opened new short positions (this is how shorts typically react after a massive price spike) and they’re heavily shorting the stock which is partially causing the downtrend in the share price.  The other reason for the downtrend in the share price is probably due to profit taking.  My thinking is that we will see share price consolidation in the $20 - 22 range at least in the near term.  What do y’all think?  Please share here.

Preferential treatment of SpaceX under Trump presidency,"Hi there,

I was analyzing my portfolio and was wondering what the effect of a trump presidency would mean for RKLB, since I would imagine SpaceX will absorb most of the government contracts due to Elon musk being in close ties with Trump. I'm thinking this will push RKLB to push for a more commercial approach and less relient on government contracts. 

What do you think? I will say that I believe since RKLB is a fair bit smaller than SpaceX at this point. I doubt anything will really happen in terms of competitivity from SpaceX, but I'm wondering how you see RKLB in this situation. It might as well be that this presidency opens up new opportunities in terms of Space exploration.

Space-X Tender offer of $350B…Good news for Rocket Lab and Space Industry,"No idea why my first post got deleted.  I didn’t see anything in it that was against the rules.  

If Rocket Lab is worth 10% of SpaceX as the #2 private provider then that is a market cap of $35B so $72 a share.  I wouldn’t be surprised if SpaceX was worth more on the public markets than for the private investors.  Look how much the market has driven up Tesla and Nvidia on future earnings that are several years away.  

My opinion is this is very bullish for Rocket Lab and investors.  The more money that goes into the space industry the more it will be spread around to the companies that can deliver.",366,80,https://i.redd.it/fxz0n4v8sj4e1.jpeg

Space Systems Potential,"Spinning off a comment, on a post that may get deleted, I thought an interesting discussion might be had on the potential of the Space Systems side of Rocket Lab.

From one of the recent articles on the CHIPs award of $23.9 million to expand manufacturing capacity of space grade solar panels. 

“Polaris Market Research to estimate that the global satellite solar cell materials market size will grow to $111.46 billion by 2032 at a compound annual growth rate of 13.2%.“

**Edit: the Zack’s/Yahoo Finance article says billions, but I’ve been informed the actual Polaris Market Research says $111.46 million. I found other sources that say $1.1 billion for space solar by 2030. Either way, nowhere near the above do I edited this post. However, I still believe space systems as a whole will be a multi-billion dollar revenue stream in the coming years, just with less of that from solar than theorized above.**

We are all excited for the Neutron launch and joining the medium lift market, the increased revenue, the increased margin with reusability. And the fact it opens up the Space as a Service market with a constellation launched by Neutron… I definitely am.

However, I think Space Systems is too often ignored in the future potential for Rocket Lab. Space systems, the manufacturing side of the business with space grade solar panels, reaction wheels, separation systems, satellite manufacturing, spacecraft manufacturing, etc… access to that market is going to be absolutely huge over the next several years imo, and is going to be a huge revenue driver for Rocket Lab. The bad inherited contracts from the Solaero acquisition are pretty much done with, the company just received a CHIPs award to expand manufacturing capacity, and alongside the other parts of space systems, I really see this side of the company driving it into multi-billions of revenue pre-constellation revenue. It has an absolutely massive potential imo and could really crank revenue through the roof as the market grows over the next couple years. The Constellation for space as a service will just be the cherry on top at that point.

Thoughts?

"Interview with Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck - Neutron Progress, Mars Sample Return, Electron & More!",Full Video on Dave G's channel,54,3,https://youtu.be/jjoJn0qiyTc?si=AyIWvhiJY7p5wFgW
Why I'm Holding till 2030 at least. My RKLB DD post.,"# Introduction

I’ve been following Rocket Lab since 2019, before it SPAC-ed in 2021. Having already known the company, I aped in following the SPAC announcement in the range of $12-$15. Slowly averaged down the cost through the SPAC-pocalypse. Average price probably in the range of $8-$10 not $4.78 as I changed brokers.

[Current position \~168,000 shares. \(\~140,000 shares are mine, the rest are held for family\) Have only trimmed \~10&#37; of shares in the recent run up as part of risk management, portfolio was 100&#37; in RKLB.](https://preview.redd.it/vn1prfwdko3e1.jpg?width=1093&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af5f6ad220bd27de3e600e6edb768f1ac71a63ae)

With the increase in stock price over the last few months and the increase in newcomers asking price target questions and new posts every time it hits a new round number, people asking if they should take profit as they expect a pull back to happen, there hasn’t been a proper DD post in awhile and I feel that many are not capturing the point that Sir Peter Beck's end goal for Rocket Lab is to be an **END-TO-END Space Company.** In my opinion it will be impossible to attribute a price target for $RKLB just simply because the industry is still in its infancy stage, instead, what is important is to see just how much of the growing space industry Rocket Lab could possibly capture in the next 5-10 years.

This is my own DD post and is not financial advise, I will attempt to cover and break down Rocket Labs business segments and why I will hold be a shareholder till 2030 and beyond.

[Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, spacecraft, satellite components, and on-orbit management - 2024 Q3 Earnings Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/xjvg1d975p3e1.jpg?width=1257&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fd1ccef8c9bea2cbd8d74e37fac398b64680181)

Although in the name, Rocket Lab is not just a launch provider, but an end-to-end space company providing, not just the launch service but also complete spacecraft design, manufacturing, satellite components and on-orbit management. Eventually, the company intends to use the experience to deliver and provide their own service from space through its own **satellite constellation**.

# Business Segments

**1. Electron**

[Electron is the only reusable orbital-class small rocket. Capturing and reflying Electron’s first stage enables higher launch frequency without expanding production and lowers launch costs.](https://preview.redd.it/okycitpk5p3e1.png?width=1345&format=png&auto=webp&s=453be91a7aad8274d7fef195c42eeb1daf48add2)

Electron is a two-stage, small-lift launch vehicle that is able to carry around 300kg to Low-Earth Orbit. Its Rutherford engines are the first electric-pump-fed engine to power an orbital-class rocket. Electron is often flown with a kick stage or Rocket Lab's Photon spacecraft. 

Proven Reliability – Electron has already flown 14 times this year, achieving record cadence, over the 10 times flown in 2023. Electron is now the 3rd most frequently launched rocket globally in 2024. 54 launches (50 successes, four failures \~ 92.5% success rate)

Responsiveness – Electron can launch from three launch pads across two hemispheres, from LC1 A/B in New Zealand, Rocket Lab’s privately owned launch pad or from LC2 in Wallops, Virginia. This has been demonstrated recently with a HASTE launch in LC2 and an electron launch within 24 hours on Nov 24/25.

[🚀 Literally to the Moon - Electron's Capstone Mission](https://preview.redd.it/hq5mcset5p3e1.png?width=1786&format=png&auto=webp&s=dee6c94313ff18c3c7a9c27bc28a84338d2094ac)

Small but powerful – On June 28, 2022, Rocket Lab launched a CubeSat to the Moon - a pathfinding mission to support NASA’s Artemis program which will land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon.

**Electron’s existential crisis, or not?** – While Electron has limitations in terms of carry capacity of 300 kg to LEO and the threat of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 Transporter Rideshare missions, Electron’s reliability and responsiveness together with its tailor-made missions have continued providing strength in demand evident from the signing of multi-launch agreements with its customers (Synspective, Capella Space, Blacksky etc.) Many discuss the threat of Electron being replaced by larger rockets, such as SpaceX’s Transporter rideshares or even Neutron cannibalising Electron in the future. However, just like taking an Uber directly to your destination or the bus somewhere near but not quite your destination, Electron together with its kick stage provides unrivaled accuracy, hitting target orbits with pinpoint accuracy.

**Why Capella Space chose Electron over Rideshare** 

“Instead of burning propellant to raise altitude, it’s far easier to simply be dropped off at a higher orbit by the launch vehicle. Being able to go higher than available rideshare missions was a major factor in Capella’s decision to pull Capella-9 from its planned launch and procure a dedicated ride from Rocket Lab for Capella-9 and Capella-10, which were launched in March 2023 on an Electron rocket to a targeted 600 km. This was also a major motivation behind the follow-on contract for four dedicated launches on Electron rockets for Acadia-generation satellites, the first of which launched to a targeted 640 km in August 2023”

[Continued Strong Demand for Electron](https://preview.redd.it/9hfpllwg6p3e1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=89128d9ce6e6660cdcb992ff6f3fdf0609146069)

The demand for Electron is also seen to be strong with the Average Selling Price increasing to what was $7.5 million to now $8.4 million. Furthermore, many of Electron’s direct competitors, mostly small launch ‘aspirational’ space companies have now been eliminated from the market.

It is NOT Rocket Science. Can’t really say that in this industry. Entrants to the small launch space have not fared well, many attribute it to a lack of demand as some pivot to larger launchers but in truth it seems that Electron has cemented its place as THE small launch provider.

**2. Haste**

https://preview.redd.it/v3l86x177p3e1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=30266164d98e447732f8e430c99bb58d3a4b887c

HASTE is a suborbital testbed launch vehicle derived from Rocket Lab’s heritage Electron rocket. HASTE provides reliable, high-cadence flight test opportunities needed to advance hypersonic and suborbital system technology development. Hypersonic speed is at least five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5 and above

[Types of Adaptions of Electron payload for HASTE vs Space-Based Orbital Electron](https://preview.redd.it/x7qeoojz7p3e1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b1fcbe1a09d5f8d9e6e7f8299e281d99bf53245)

# 

From air-breathing and glide payloads to ballistic and future technologies, HASTE is a cost-effective and responsive hypersonic testbed that enables precision payload delivery for every mission.

[Leidos was awarded $334M air-breathing hypersonic system contract](https://preview.redd.it/rzpb8vfp8p3e1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=4995acc3b4ce982c65204c7969cc708a73981ec1)

Rocket Lab has had two HASTE missions so far, with the first HASTE mission on 17 June 2023 for Leidos. Leidos was awarded [$334M air-breathing hypersonic contract](https://www.leidos.com/insights/leidos-awarded-334m-air-breathing-hypersonic-system-contract) in 2022.

Russia has already demonstrated its use of the Khinzal hypersonic missile in Ukraine and the Pentagon’s warning to the congress that China already possesses the world’s leading hypersonic arsenal, the United States still does not possess its own arsenal of hypersonic missiles. As the US plays catch up, Rocket Lab stands to win, with at least another 3 HASTE missions for Leidos for 2024/2025  as part of the MACH-TB (Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed program.

Instead of highlighting how large the Total Addressable Market hypersonics could be, it would be more useful to highlight the innovation of Rocket Lab and also management’s ability to understand its technologies to adapt and create new use cases.

**3. Space Systems**

[We Don't Just Build Rockets in this Lab](https://preview.redd.it/03v1c2fk9p3e1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=27f2b92571ecd7eb36c692bb14caf370aa86db7b)

While rockets are really nice to look at, it is important to understand that launch business makes up only 20-30% of revenue of Rocket Lab, with Space Systems making up the majority of revenue contribution. Rocket Lab’s expansion into Space Systems through in-house capabilities or through acquisition is what seems to be most under-rated by investors/analysts.

**THIS IS WHERE I AM REALLY BULLISH. RECURRING REVENUE. MORE STUFF IN SPACE = MORE RECURRING REVENUE**

Starlink satellites have a lifespan of about five years. After which it will re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere and be destroyed. Satellites need replenishing, and companies are heading towards mega constellations to provide their services, Rocket Lab will either manufacture, provide components, flight software or even deploy them with Neutron. With the space economy projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030, and $1.8 trillion by 2035. Rocket Lab’s position as an end-to-end space company seems like a no-brainer as long as the company is able to capture a portion and with more than 1,700 satellites launched to orbit with Rocket Lab technology already, it seems to be on the right path. Some highlights of Rocket Lab’s space systems.

**a. Reaction Wheels**

[Love that we now ship pallets of reaction wheels to constellation customers. - Peter Beck](https://preview.redd.it/fofd4136bp3e1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=26d87d2a06b834269b21f22762292abb2dd2e37a)

A satellite typically needs at least three reaction wheels to control its movement along the X, Y, and Z axes. However, satellites often have four reaction wheels for redundancy

Deal already signed with a [single confidential mega constellation customer ](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/24/rocket-lab-reveals-big-supplier-deal-with-mystery-mega-constellation-customer/#:~:text=In%20its%20data%20sheet%20on,the%20base%20price%20at%20%24100%2C000)for thousands of reaction wheels per year. If you’re wondering who it could be… [Amazzz](https://www.youtube.com/live/wmmNuU8-Tr8?si=xpO2MeoKJ2KyHw5F&t=1218)

Amazon’s Kuiper constellation will have an initial 3,236 satellites Which likely will need replenishing every five years as well. That’s a good stream of recurring revenue for reaction wheels alone.

[\~4,000 to 5,000 satellites launched annually in 2030 - McKinsey](https://preview.redd.it/lmb1i4tmcp3e1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e5378628bdb2ce794333f878b8f54c530979638)

McKinsey anticipates in the base case, 27,000 active satellites in orbit by the end of 2030, almost a four-fold increase from today. To maintain that number at the assumed lifespan, there would need to be 4,000 to 5,000 satellites launched per year. In the high-demand scenario, in which nearly all proposed constellations materialize, McKinsey would expect to see more than 65,000 satellites, including many heavier ones, on orbit by 2030.

**b. Space Grade Solar**

[In 2022, Rocket Lab acquired leading satellite solar power producer SolAero Technologies. ](https://preview.redd.it/boenu4xrdp3e1.png?width=921&format=png&auto=webp&s=35bc3927f9baa504c4f498ec3ffddf844c274cd2)

Satellites need power. With the acquisition of Sol Aero, Rocket Lab is now one of the few space grade solar providers. Already there are more than 1,100 satellites in space powered by Rocket Lab solar products. The company has also been [awarded $23.9million](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-11-25/us-finalizes-awards-to-bae-systems-rocket-lab-for-semiconductor-chips) to boost the company’s production of solar cells by 50% over the next three years.

**c. Separation Systems**

[No separation anxiety - Example of Rocket Lab’s Separation System](https://preview.redd.it/i8s75ussep3e1.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a75dda0512efd875bab92e6f01da9ca86fee5d96)

In 2021 Rocket Lab acquired Planetary Systems Corporation which has designed, built, and delivered separation systems for more than 20 years with a 100% success rate - no product has ever failed to operate in flight. With the scale and resources of Rocket Lab behind the team, we are now making separation systems available globally at scale.

**d. Space Software**

[In October 2021, Rocket Lab acquired Advanced Solutions, Inc \(ASI\), a Colorado-based aerospace engineering firm delivering mission proven space software, mission simulation, and testing solutions.](https://preview.redd.it/quczg7jyep3e1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=98c4593cdd1a44f7e5e3377c5ea0b8be3c21a571)

As part of the end-to-end service, Rocket Lab also provides software and operation for customer satellites.

The vertically integrated and end-to-end space service Rocket Lab provides will allow customers who are looking to provide a service from space do so without any knowledge of building and operating spacecrafts.

Right now companies like Varda are still space companies applying pharmaceutical and life science applications, and even have outsourced [Rocket Lab will to conduct in-space operations](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-completes-second-spacecraft-for-varda-space-industries-advancing-in-space-manufacturing/), reentry positioning maneuvers, and deorbiting to recover Varda’s capsule while they attempt to develop the own in-house solutions. However, Rocket Lab's end goal as THE end-to-end space provider, is for companies with no knowledge of building or operating spacecrafts contracting Rocket Lab for its services.

**4. Catalysts**  
Written so much and I have not even covered Neutron, Space Race, Possibility with Mars Sample Return, NSSL Neutron On-ramping, SDA Contracts, Human rated Neutron launches. I'll point over to [Dave G Investing's video](https://youtu.be/rt4_g87TxL8?si=PHAi9oegs_13u0AL) on the potential nearer term catalysts, I think he covers it in great detail.

[Dave G Investing - Potential Catalysts](https://preview.redd.it/xvnfaef9jp3e1.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=540f11194cebd49866ceb72b3b7a7e6e628b4a0c)

Further term growth opportunities include Neutron signing more commercial launches to deploy constellations or even taking on some contracts to help deploy Kuiper if any of their launch providers for their 83 launches fail to deliver. Also as SPB mentioned, Neutron’s success will then allow for Rocket Lab to develop its own constellation. These catalysts really show the uncapped potential of the company, which makes valuing the company today extremely difficult, which is why I will be holding my shares, at least a good amount of it till 2030.

**5. Conclusion**

[This guy doesn't build shit](https://preview.redd.it/wqzjk4zmjp3e1.png?width=1505&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5b3ab591beb4426ff8223a327fa6c41f8e14b44)

Trust in SPB. He knows Rockets. Watch Wild Wild Space on HBO for those who haven't.

Rocket engineer at heart, he developed Electron with less than $100 million compared to rockets like Virgin Orbit's LauncherOne estimated to be over $1 billion and still failed.

Let's talk MSR and competing proposals...,"MSR. So hot right now. For better or worse, I wanted to share my opinions on the likelihood RKLB gets the MSR mission.

I realize we only have the abstracts for the proposals, but it should be enough to tell us who is taking this seriously. I'm honestly flabbergasted at some of the proposals, and I've attempted to summarize the abstracts even further below. You'll quickly see that it's a two, MAYBE three horse race... and RKLB is in it.

* Rocket Lab: ""We put a lot of effort into this proposal, and intend to show you just why we are the perfect choice. We can and have done nearly everything you're asking a company to do, we have a proven track record and a reliable path to mission success, and we can do it faster and cheaper than anyone else.""

* Lockheed Martin: ""Sure, we can do it for your max budget and.... sometime... before 2040. We have lots of experience with this stuff, dude. We've partnered with you before and we sure liked all the cash you filled our coffers with. Give us the contract and we will do the bare minimum to meet any of your needs. But we're pals, man! Like, our relationship goes WAY back... and don't forget the lobbying money we spend! So... can we have the money now? kthx""

* Blue Origin: ""So you're already building SLS and HLS, so...let's like... leverage those options, and then you won't even need to worry about how many samples you can return! *SLAPS 4 BILLION DOLLAR ROCKET* This baby can fit SO MANY mars samples inside of it!! We can't talk about schedule because uh.... that's kind of on you (wink wink) but uh.... we think by using these options you might be able to accelerate your schedule? But listen to THIS... we've got a couple of super brainy Ph.D.'s leading a ""team"" of EXPERTS looking into all of this, and they have a whole 50 years of combined experience on mars missions! So uh.... pick us, and then we might actually take any of this seriously.""

* Quantum Space: ""We develop spacecraft. Or.... I guess... we're trying to. We haven't had any success at all, but we're smart cookies who think outside the box!! We think we came up with a novel but quite difficult approach to trajectory and spacecraft needs by basically doing a lunar orbit rendezvous and hand off of the samples to another vessel before returning to Earth. Sure, we know you're probably going to call this bullshit, be we prefer to call it a ""disruptive concept"""".

* Aerojet Rocketdyne: ""We're smart cookies and we take this seriously. We've already identified areas where we can reduce the mass of the theoretical MAV and SRL, and that would allow us to use existing technologies to get the lander on the surface. We've been doing this a long time and have a lot of success, and we've already started to figure out which propulsion technologies would fit into a mission like this or which would need to develop further. We really want to use the skycrane to land the MAV, and will likely concentrate all efforts on that front since it would speed things up considerably. The reduced mass MAV and SRL will allow us to return plenty of samples.""

* Northrop Grumman: ""So we are like, quite competent in propulsion, and we've been doing this stuff for like, a really long time. We will do some uh.... engineering.... and uh, we want some government money so we can keep developing our solid rocket motors. And then you can use them for this mission!! :D""

* SpaceX: ""Uhh... we're already going to mars. We don't know when, but.... we can just pick up your samples for you while we're there, and then charge you a shit ton of money for the privilege :) Sit back and relax!""

* Whittinghill Aerospace: ""We're a cutting-edge tech firm out of the Midwest, awaiting imminent patent approval on the next generation of ~~radar detectors (D2D)~~ MON hybrid rocket motors that have both huge military and civilian applications. Now, right now John, our stock trades over the counter at $0.10.... but we..... oh shit.... wrong number.""


So, alright then. We have some serious proposals, and we have some jokers. I think there are a few that you can remove straight off the bat. Whittinghill and Quantum Space. One is an engineering company, and the other makes spacecraft. Lots of companys do both, these companies do just the one, and are both quite small and not in a position to handle such an important contract. That widles us down from 8 to 6.

This is where it gets a little tricky, since we don't know what's actually in the proposals... all we have are the abstracts. But taking things at face value, there are a few additional proposals that don't really seem to be taking it seriously, or don't really offer any value to NASA by choosing them. Those options are Lockheed, BO, and Northrop. Yes, THOSE BIG THREE. Why? Lockheed is basically ""max budget, max timeline"". What incentive does that provide? BO relies on SLS sticking around AND on HLS sticking around.... which kinda feels like a complication of.... the SpaceX option? And Northrop can just pound sand. Their abstract is one of the worst in the whole bunch outside of Whittinghil and Quantum IMO. 

So... that leaves THREE actual ""competitors"" IMO. Let's dig into those. Rocket Lab, SpaceX, and Aerojet Rocketdyne, so let's start with Rocketdyne. They've put in the effort here, and have the company heritage to execute on their claims. They want to leverage existing technologies, while developing their rocket motors further so they can reduce the weight of the MAV. Smart cookies here, but no real promise on a timeline. Just vague talks of being able to 'accelerate' the timeline if they CAN leverage the skycrane the way they want. Solid choice, reasonable value to NASA. I give this option a B+.

Now let's talk about SpaceX. It's not so much a 'proposal' for a 'mission' as it is like, ""Hey Jim, I'm running to the store anyways. Want me to bring you back anything? Oh...no... I'm not going now. I'm going in like... 5-9 years... or something?"". It's not a BAD proposal, but without knowing the financials it's hard to say how likely NASA would be to choose this option. They're relying on HLS anyways, so if Starship is gonna be a thing, this could make sense. But they lose a lot of control, and who knows if their proposal is for a $9B budget and a return date in 2038? They don't say, and I don't think NASA will like losing that much control and influence on the mission. I give this option a C-. Feasible, but probably not NASA's best actual choice, since it really strips them of their autonomy.

And finally.... Rocket Lab. They can do it for under $2B on a fixed-price contract WAY earlier than NASA's requirement of 2040. They've built spacecraft, sent spacecraft to the moon using multiple trajectory burns, they've engineered and built spacecraft busses, reaction wheels, solar panels, navigation and guidance systems, rocket engines and rockets themselves, and they've even returned a capsule to earth that had samples inside of it already. They can do the entire mission, end-to-end, for 18.1% of NASA's budget, and get the samples here almost a DECADE earlier than required. Even IF NASA choose RKLB and they didn't deliver as promised, NASA would have SO much damn cash left to pursue other avenues (and presumably, almost a decade to do it...) that it would seem almost criminal for them not to select the RKLB proposal. RKLB could fail and they'd still be likely to succeed ""Hey Elon... grab us some samples on your next 2038 Mars mission... here's $5B"". Cool. NASA still got the samples back before 2040 and for $7B. I give this proposal an A-. The only thing keeping me from an A or an A+ is that Neutron isn't flying yet.

So, those are my big three that have a chance, but I personally think it boils down to Rocket Lab and Aerojet Rocketdyne. SpaceX is going to mars anyways, and like I mentioned above, we could just pivot to having them bring us back some samples a decade from now if things don't otherwise work out. For that reason, I give the SpaceX proposal a 15% chance of being selected, the Rocketdyne proposal a 40% chance of being selected, and RKLB a 45% chance of being selected. I'm assuming all the proposals I 'eliminated' earlier have a 0% chance, but that's likely not true. However, I wanted to simplify this.

So, from my seat, RKLB is actually the MOST likely proposal to be selected for MSR? Why? Execution, cost, and timeline PLUS the ability to NASA to pivot to SpaceX in the 2030's if necessary. Rocketdyne a close second.

An Observation ,"I’m sure we’re all excited about another monster trading session after a surreal run up.  I’m probably not the only one wondering each week if, and when, the eventual pull back is going to happen..  only to see the stock go higher.

I thought I’d share a quick story of an interaction earlier today to give some context to what many of us wrestle with.

I went to PT this morning, and we were shooting the breeze about life when she asked what I was up to.  We’re pretty good friends at this point, and the conversation drifted towards investing since it’s something I’m passionate about.  Naturally, Rocket Lab came up, and she was genuinely curious so I spent some time sharing the bullet points about the company, Peter Beck, the sector, etc.  The other two providers that were nearby joined in the conversation since they didn’t have clients at the time, and so I talked to them about it too.

What was absolutely fascinating to me was that none of them had ever heard of Rocket Lab.  These are intelligent, accomplished, capable medical professionals.  

People like to joke about you know it’s time to sell when you over hear Uber & Lyft drivers talking about a stock.  I think the opposite is true as well.  Anecdotally, outside of this sub, WSB, and X/twitter, there is practically no one in my professional or personal spheres that has heard of this company - unless I’ve personally told them about it.  

My point is..  the recent run up as been incredible, and while there is a very real possibility of a drawback in the near future, especially for some unforeseen news or black swan event, this company is still one of the best kept secrets.  

Of course I could be wrong, and there is a lot of risk ahead and plenty that could go badly..  However, I think this is still just the initial wave crashing upon the shoreline.  Once more people clue in, it’s going to be interesting.

I’d be very curious how many folks on this sub have had anyone tell them about RKLB, and not the other way around.

TLDR:  we are just getting started.

Powerful endorsement yesterday by Blackrock for both ASTS and RKLB,"i am pretty sure no one posted this on this sub, so here goes:

Tony Kim, Head of Technology Investing at BlackRock, discusses AST SpaceMobile and Rocket Lab at the Deutsche Bank Global Space Summit 2024.

“In the public market, I think there are two companies that are over $5B and they have been a recent resurgence, but it has been 20 years of hell. But there has been a recent resurgence of two companies that crossed $5B of market cap …. And the two are not posterchilds of profitability. What they are is that they represent leadership. The power log ?
In the case of one company regarding potentially unlocking direct communications and the other one , the alternative to SpaceX on launch. So those are the two. They’re not really profitable yet, but they have the market valuation. The rest, they are mired in small subset of valuations? So yes, profitability is of course important, but I think more important is, are you a viable business with scale. Are you one of the companies that will achieve scale. And with scale comes profitability.”

Should You Buy $RKLB After the Big Run-Up? Here’s a Litmus Test,"Hey everyone,

I’ve noticed a lot of posts lately asking, “Should I buy $RKLB now after the huge price increase?” Here’s a litmus test to help guide your decision:

First, ask yourself: If you already owned the stock, would you sell it now? If the answer is no because you think the price will continue to rise, then why wouldn’t you buy more now? If you believe in the company’s long-term future, the recent run-up shouldn’t deter you.

Remember, investors are in it for the long haul. Traders are the ones making short-term moves. And if you’re asking a biased community for financial advice, it’s probably a sign that you’re not the best trader. Timing the market is notoriously difficult, and most people don’t get it right.

So instead of focusing on short-term fluctuations, ask yourself if Rocket Lab’s long-term vision aligns with your investment goals. Don’t try to time the market—make decisions based on your confidence in the company’s future.

As always, do your own research and assess your personal financial situation.

Neutron and a mega constellation, along with a thriving space systems business, is a ways away. That's the carrot at the end of the stick. Even so, that can't be the end of the story. I find it difficult to believe that is as far as it goes.

Space operations and management constellation?,"With the imminent retirement of the NASA ""Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System"" (TDRS), I have been wondering if some sort of space operations and management constellation might be a good candidate for Rocket Lab's first space services constellation?

First some background courtesy of Chat GPT:

**What is the TDRS?**

The *Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System* (TDRS) is NASA's communication network used to support real-time data and command transmission between Earth and spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO), such as the International Space Station and the Hubble Space Telescope. Operating since 1983, TDRS consists of multiple geostationary satellites and ground stations, providing near-continuous coverage.

The system facilitates telemetry, tracking, and data transfer, enabling critical operations for various NASA missions. NASA is transitioning to commercial services as TDRS ages.

**What is the CSP?**

The *Communication Services Project* (CSP) is a NASA initiative aimed at transitioning from government-owned satellite communication systems, such as the TDRS, to commercially operated services. The CSP involves partnerships with private companies to develop and demonstrate advanced communication capabilities for space missions. These capabilities include satellite relay, ground-to-space communications, and data transmission, ensuring reliable and cost-effective support for NASA's future needs. The project is a cornerstone of NASA's strategy to leverage private-sector innovation for space infrastructure.

**What is SSA?**

*Space Situational Awareness* (SSA) refers to the ability to track and understand the behavior of objects in space, including active satellites, debris, and other spacecraft. SSA involves monitoring their positions, predicting potential collisions, and assessing risks to space operations. It is crucial for satellite operators, governments, and military organizations to ensure safe and sustainable use of Earth's orbits, particularly as space becomes increasingly crowded with new satellites and debris. SSA data is gathered using ground-based and space-based sensors, radar, and optical systems.

**What is a SON?**

*Satellite Operations Network* (SON) refers to the integrated system of ground stations, communication links, and software infrastructure used to manage, monitor, and control a satellite or a constellation of satellites. The SON ensures the execution of mission commands, monitors telemetry data, and facilitates two-way communication between satellites and operators. Advanced SONs often include automation, real-time data analysis, and tools for handling large-scale constellations with minimal human intervention.

**What is STM?**

*Space Traffic Management* (STM) refers to the planning, coordination, and execution of operations to ensure the safe and sustainable use of Earth’s orbital environment. It encompasses tracking space objects (satellites, debris), avoiding collisions, managing orbital slots, and coordinating launches. STM combines policy frameworks, technical systems (like SSA), and international cooperation to mitigate risks from space congestion and orbital debris, ensuring efficient and safe space operations for both public and private entities.

**What would you call a combined SSA, SON and STM system?**

A combined system integrating *Space Situational Awareness* (SSA), *Satellite Operations Network* (SON), and *Space Traffic Management* (STM) could be called an *Integrated Space Operations and Management System* (ISOMS) or *Unified Orbital Management Network* (UOMN).

Such a system would unify tracking, operational control, and traffic management functions, ensuring seamless coordination between monitoring orbital environments, controlling satellite constellations, and preventing collisions or other orbital conflicts. This integration would enable efficient and secure satellite operations in increasingly congested space environments.

Thanks Chat GPT!

I'm not suggesting that Rocket Lab will join other commercial entities participating in the CSP, there are already plenty of big names there including Kuiper and Starlink. Perhaps Rocket Lab may partner with some of them. But it occurs to me that if you want to build an end-to-end space company, that designs, builds and operates customer constellations, you'll need some of the same functionality that the TDRS provides NASA - and you may not want to rely on other commercial CSP entities to provide it.

Back over to Chat GPT:

**Describe a UOMN constellation? How many satellites? How many ground stations? What orbits required?**

A *Unified Orbital Management Network* (UOMN) constellation would likely require a combination of LEO (Low Earth Orbit) and MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) satellites to cover both tracking and communication needs. The number of satellites would depend on coverage requirements, but a network of 30–50 satellites could be sufficient for global tracking and communication.

Ground stations would be strategically placed worldwide, with at least 5–10 ground stations for redundancy and global reach. The system would also need robust inter-satellite links, especially for real-time traffic management and command/control capabilities.

Thanks Chat GPT!

OK so Rocket Lab would need some help with ground stations, and whilst they have their own RF space radios, they may also want to pick up some space optical expertise. With $300M in the Mergers & Aquisitions kitty, perhaps there are some targets?

SpaceX Encourages Competition,"SpaceX’s President and COO encouraged competition in space, emphasizing that the market is enormous and that it’s unlikely SpaceX alone can service the entire market. Especially in space broadband, she described the opportunity as huge with room for plenty of competition. Basically, the tide is ready to lift all boats and they don’t see their construction of a luxury super yacht as holding anyone else back from getting rich in the new space economy…

On launch, it also appears they are willing to make trade offs in medium launch to capture the most profitable end of heavy launch in pursuit of their long term goals. That seems to leave the door wide open for Rocket Lab. Interesting comments:

“Starship is really a replacement. It obsoletes Falcon 9 and the Dragon capsule. Now, we’re not shutting down Falcon, we are not shutting down Dragon — we’ll be flying that for six to eight more years,” she said.

“But ultimately, people are going to want to fly on Starship: It’s bigger, it’s more comfortable, it will be less expensive,” Shotwell added.”",73,23,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/15/spacex-gwynne-shotwell-starlink-competition.html
Valuation ,"I keep seeing comments that RKLB is cheap and SpaceX is overvalued. Or other commentary that sounds like it is based on faith and not thought out metrics. Full disclosure I'm bullish on both. 

Morgan Stanley has probably one of the most publicly available in-depth analysis of SpaceX value. They note that 60% of the value is in Starlink. That would make SpaceX rocket side about a $75B valuation. Given their launch revenue was estimated to be $5.5B for 2024 that is a revenue multiplier of 13.6x. Apply that to Rocket lab and you get a valuation of $10b on $245m of revenue and you have a revenue multiplier of 40.8x. 

RocketLab's launch business is three times more expensive to buy than SpaceX's right now. Not sure SpaceX is overvalued (on launch).  Starship is arguably a much bigger leap than Neutron (new model vs providing a launch alternative to existing model). So, not sure how SpaceX can be called overvalued and at the same time saying RocketLab has room for another 150% gain ($50 share).

If this is correct (and it was quick and sort price analysis), does RKLB benefit from IPO access and demand for the sector that cannot be easily accessed via SpaceX? Is there something else driving the multiplier difference? Yes both companies do more than launch, but one has turned that into revenue while the other is just starting down that path. And that portion of the valuation is pulled out of SpaceX in the above analysis and assumed to be $0 for RKLB. 

Maybe that's the difference. That the market is already valuing the non-launch business at even more astronomical multipliers than SpaceX's non-launch business.",60,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1gs6fmx/valuation/

Confidential Customers?  Expect more of them and why I’m accumulating shares.,"First of all I screwed up buy reducing my shares after it gained 200%.  I was buying at $3.5 - $6 and after a healthy increase I sold some around $10.  I still have a good amount and I’m accumulating again and here is why…

This latest launch was by a “confidential customer” and the new contracts for neutron are also from a “confidential customer.”  I knew they would beat earnings since the new customer wasn’t factored into the earnings forecast during the Q3 presentation so I bought a bunch more and calls just before earnings.  Be prepared to see “confidential customer” a lot from Rocket Lab in the future.  A lot of developed countries, especially in Europe, do not see Trump as an ally and now that Leon is part of the government they want to distance themselves from him and SpaceX.  If Trump installs large tariffs then you can easily predict a trade war.  The faster these other countries get up their own internet satellite systems the better.  Not only do they not want to rely on Starlink for secure communications, they don’t want to rely on SpaceX to put up their satellites.  This is where Rocket Lab will be taking full advantage of having non-U.S. based launch facilities.  For those that have been here awhile there were rumors of Rocket Lab acquiring a constellation builder in the U.K.  I fully expect that to happen now to service their European and Asian customers and be fully integrated from build to launch.   I bet we get news of that before the 4th Quarter earnings in February.  Several people that are very Pro SpaceX / Leon  won’t read this far and you will see responses from them below calling this bullshit and how SpaceX is far and away the only real private company option for other countries….just watch.

My prediction is RKLB between $35 - $50 by the end of 2025 unless there is a black swan event.

Only the strong survive… the great SPAC attack of 2019,"The year is 2019… 

Virgin Galactic merges with SCH to create SPCE, ushering in a new age of retail space investing…

Virgin Galactic, rooted in the genius of legendary aerospace designer Burt Rutan and Scaled Composites, becomes a public company via Richard Branson…

Virgin Galactic promises a bright future for future space tourists and investors. 

Branson would later take small satellite launcher, Virgin Orbit (VORB), public via merger with NextGen Acquisition Corp. 

Virgin Orbit wants it all. 

On September 25, 2020… Vector Acquisition Corp goes public. 

On August 25, 2021,… a young, fledgling space startup company founded by rocket bike connoisseur, New Zealander, gold-prospector, and cabbage patch look-alike, Peter Beck, merges with VACQ.

Rocket Lab enters the commercial space race as a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ. But legacy space and defense contractors dismiss RocketLab’s Electron rocket as too small for doing serious rocketry. 

It is early 2023…

After a global pandemic and nuclear winter for raising capital, the shakeout is in full swing. Space launch startups like Astra, Relativity, and Branson’s Virgin Orbit are teetering on the brink.  Claims of large 2B backlogs and realities of horizontal flying rockets will not save them from impending doom. 

On April 4, 2023, Branson’s Virgin Orbit files for bankruptcy, crushing hopes of a free satellite launching future not dominated by old school contractors and the SpaceX monopoly. 

The demand for satellite constellations and real-time global connectivity grows. 

It is June 20th 2024…

Rocket Lab successfully launches its 50th Electron mission, the fastest rocket to do so. Rocket Lab is also in full swing developing its medium lift Neutron rocket. 

It is August, 2024…

The archimedes engine breathes fire. People are skeptical of Neutron’s new engine, calling bullshit on Peter Beck for not releasing a long video of a hot fire.   

However, Peter Beck confirms a hot fire later in the month.  

The industry is put on check.

It is November 12, 2024…

In the Q3 earnings call, Peter Beck confirms Neutron is open for business. The first Neutron contract for a constellation operator has been confirmed.

The rate to borrow on [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rklb) for tomorrow is 3.3% APR. Now that's not really HIGH but it is much higher than it was the past week because the fee goes up when more people want to short it (read about it [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-loan-fee.asp)).  So more shorts interested in us.  The more shares short, the more downward pressure on the stock. 

I still see blanket 10M shares available short but I don't know where that info came from or if it's the 2 week lag that is often placed on the public info (and I don't have a subscription to the services that update it).  IBKR shows shares still available but that likely won't update until 7am EST tomorrow as well. 

There's too many brokers out there but if you are long the stock and you don't want your shares leant out (to be paid a portion of that 3.3% because brokers take their cut of course), you should google: ""\[insert your broker\] opt out of securities lending"". 

All the brokers think this is a good thing - [RH](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/stock-lending/), [Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/securities-lending), [Ally](https://www.ally.com/invest/self-directed-trading/securities-income-program/), [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/fully-paid-lending), etc. - Likely your broker has it too. They all ""want you to earn interest"" but to read up a bit more on [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitieslending.asp).. but they summarize to this:

So if you like it and want it to go up... decide what you want to happen.. don't let the brokers decide.. 

Clearly it's all our individual choices but just some information from the meme stock era that might help us all. 

Goodluck errybody.

Positive press for Firefly and its posture for competition against Neutron and others…,"What are your thoughts on the the heavy recent investment in Firefly? They appear to be targeting similar market segments to both Rocket Lab and Intuitive Machines - anyone here concerned about the potential for their medium launch vehicle to outcompete Neutron or otherwise siphon market share? 

From the article:
“In the hierarchy of launch vehicles, these one-ton-class rockets fit in between a class of heavier rockets, such as those from SpaceX, United Launch Alliance, and Blue Origin, and smaller launchers like Rocket Lab's Electron. Rocket Lab is the clear leader in the lighter launch segment, while Firefly is well ahead of its cohort in the one-ton launcher race. Like Firefly, Rocket Lab is also working on its own medium-class rocket called the Neutron…”

“NASA has awarded Firefly three task orders under the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. Firefly will soon ship its first Blue Ghost lunar lander to Florida for final preparations to launch to the Moon and deliver 10 NASA-sponsored scientific instruments and tech demo experiments to the lunar surface. NASA has a contract with Firefly for a second Blue Ghost mission, plus an agreement for Firefly to transport a European data relay satellite to lunar orbit.

Firefly also boasts a healthy backlog of missions on its Alpha rocket. In June, Lockheed Martin announced a deal for as many as 25 Alpha launches through 2029. Two months later, L3Harris inked a contract with Firefly for up to 20 Alpha launches. Firefly has also signed Alpha launch contracts with NASA, NOAA, the Space Force, and the National Reconnaissance Office. One of these Alpha launches will deploy Firefly's first orbital transfer vehicle, named Elytra, designed to host customer payloads and transport them to different orbits following separation from the launcher's upper stage.

And there's the Medium Launch Vehicle, a rocket Firefly and Northrop Grumman hope to launch as soon as 2026…”",6,20,https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/firefly-aerospace-rakes-in-more-cash-as-competitors-struggle-for-footing/

Now, they did $105,000,000 in revenue in Q3 And are only down $17,000,000 in the backlog which means they added $88,000,000 in backlog. 

I'm trying to figure out where this came from. They did state $55,000,000 came from new electron launch contracts. But that would only leave $33,000,000 between the 2 Neutron launch contracts and any potential space system deals.

Value of the Mahia spaceport?,"One thing that is occasionally brought up in the financial analyses is RKLB’s ownership of the Māhia launch complex.  

It’s obviously a boon to the company to own and operate its own spaceport but I’m wondering if it should get more play in discussing Rocket Lab’s uniqueness as an investment.  It seems to me that as time goes on, it’s going to become even more difficult to procure sites for launch - certainly in the US it’s not easy, and you have to fight a mountain of regulations (which may or may not go away under Trump).  Owning a launch site in a developed country with low levels of international air traffic seems to be a major strategic win and another big point in favor of rocket lab’s moat. 

Is there a legal/regulatory reason that Mahia is limited to electron launches?  Is this ITAR stuff (build neutron in the US, can’t ship that tech out of the US?).

Does anyone understand or can point to a source that explains the exact relation between Apple, Globalstar, MDA and RKLB ?

The way I understand it is Apple contracts Globalstar to operate a constellation to provide direct to cell services which then contracts MDA to build the spacecraft, MDA then subcontracts RKLB for most of the design / satellite bus

Sounds like the reaction wheels contract could maybe be for a Apple constellation rather than Kuiper

How do you see it and then what percentage of the 1.5 Billion can we execpt to subcontract its way to RKLB and maybe be announced at earnings next week ?

Advice to small investors on RKLB - Stay away from buying options for a while.,"This is an advice to small investors who are entering the market from an experienced investor who did lose money playing options.

Options are very tempting at the moment given the run RKLB had this quarter. Every stock will have pullback. When it does, time value eat away potential profits.

Your best bet through earnings is to buy the stock and sell out of the money covered calls for November end. The money you make from the covered calls, you can put it back into RKLB to increase your share count. Don't despair if your options are called. Do it again.

Consider buying options when RSI goes below 40 and MACDs are in negative territory. This is where technical analysis will help you.

If the options you bought are expiring worthless, you giving free money to whales. A $1000 from you pocket may not seem much. But a hundred players like yourself giving free money to whales every week is Big Whale Money.

We are coming off a consolidation phase and a gap up occurred today. From a technicals point of view,

1. There was a shooting star candlestick pattern on 10/24. Stock dipped by about 15% from a high of 12.09 to a low $10.16 on 10/31.  After this it crossed $13.
2. No major catalysts during this period. 
3. MACD's are crossing over and turning positive

The setup is incredible going into the earnings. I love this uptrend and I am betting that SPB has some great news to share on the earnings call. IMO, There are people seeing ""A secular trend"" and that's the driver for this momentum.  I mentioned this in my previous post. Other than that, I have no inside information.

PS: To newbie options players. This is not the best time to sell CC's. Option buyers, the premiums are just too high. Nov15 $17 1254 contracts were traded for $0.12. That's ridiculous. Don't throw away your money. **Sometimes, you miss the boat. Accept it. Don't chase it. Buy shares instead.**

Here's my take on Apple's $1.5 billion investment and the impact it could have on RKLB,"***\\!/ This is not financial advice \\!/***

For those who aren't aware already, Apple has just announced on Friday a $1.5 billion satellite investment with Globalstar to improve space-based communications for iPhones. The deal is expected to close on Nov. 5.

Here is all the information I could find in order to form a realistic expectation on the effects such a deal could have on RKLB.

First things first, Globalstar is the company with which Apple has been partnering with since 2022 to offer emergency services on its latest iPhones when terrestrial networks are unavailable. Globalstar is managing the constellation Apple uses to provide that service. It is specified in the deal that Apple will make cash payments of $1.1 billion to help Globalstar fund the new network of satellites but, it is also said that SpaceX is expected to begin launching those new satellites next year. It is important to note that Globalstar's constellation is in LEO (low-earth orbit) and that  their network does not \*yet\* provide more bandwidth-hungry services such as voice and broadband as of today.

**Back to 2022's subcontract with MDA:**

RocketLab is directly involved in Globalstar's ""old"" constellation because in 2022, RKLB was awarded a subcontract by MDA ""to lead the design and manufacture of 17 spacecraft buses for Globalstar’s new Low Earth Orbit satellites"". MDA is the company that initially got the contrat to build those 17 new satellites. Rocket Lab is also developing the Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC) for the constellation. The Globalstar SOCC includes a continuous satellite control and monitoring using Rocket Lab’s MAX GDS, a constellation-class ground software solution that provides complete spacecraft command and control. What is also important to note is that the telemetry and control radio for all spacecraft will also be a C-band variant of Rocket Lab’s Frontier Satellite Radio (Frontier-C). Rocket Lab's Frontier Satellite Radios are Software-defined radio (SDR). SDRs are a radio communication system where components that conventionally have been implemented in analog hardware (e.g. mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, etc.) are instead implemented by means of software on a computer or embedded system. 

**What are spacecraft buses?:**

Spacecraft buses can be referred to as satellite platforms which are the support on which to mount instruments and the infrastructure for the mission such as power, communications to the ground and navigation. A spacecraft bus consists of everything needed to transport, protect, and operate the payload. In our case, RKLB was in charge of the manufacturing of the satellite platforms in the 2022 contract and MDA was in charge of the payload which is the primary function of the satellite's mission. 

**MDA's new Aurora satellites:**

MDA announced their new Aurora satellite line in March 2024. Aurora is a new software-defined satellite product line which is basically a transition from analog to digital satellite technology. MDA has also made new partnerships with new companies to supply components for Aurora. 

Here's a list of a few partnerships I could find: 

1. Aerospacelab announced July 8, 2024 that it will provide more than 200 battery charge regulators for MDA Space’s Aurora satellites over a three-year period starting in 2026. These components are used to manage power distribution and battery charging in satellite systems. 
2. Airbus will supply more than 200 Sparkwing solar arrays that will be built on a designated line at Airbus' high-capacity production facility in Leiden, the Netherlands.
3. Switzerland’s Huber+Suhner was selected to supply more than 60,000 multi-channel radio frequency (RF). 

The list above refers to components that are used in the manufacturing of a satellite platform/satellite bus. If MDA was still using RKLB's satellite platforms, why would they buy components which are generally used for the making of the satellite platform and not the payload? 

Also, SDR setup involves an RF front-end connected to a computer that will perform the conversions from analog to digital. In other words and from my understanding, multi-channel radio refrequency (RF) is a component used in the making of a Software-defined radio (SDR). If MDA was still using RKLB's SDRs, why would they buy multi-channel frequency systems from another supplier? 

Obviously, I'm not an aerospace engineer or anywhere near that job industry, but prior to the launch of their new Aurora line, I personally think MDA needed RKLB's SDR to actually make their precedent satellite line ""Software-defined"". Since they've now developed their own fully software-defined satellite line, it doesn't seem like they'd still use RKLB's components. Also, the latest contracts for Aurora satellites do not mention any partnership with RKLB. In fact, MDA's press release in August 2023 about their contract with Telesat briefly mentions a new line of satellite and a transition from analog to software-defined satellites. It also seems like, by the recent partnerships MDA made for Aurora's components, that MDA is now making their very own satellite buses also. 

**From all the information above, here's what I think:**

1. It doesn't seem like RKLB is going to be the launch provider since SpaceX is already slated to begin launches in 2025. 
2. In November 2023, MDA received an Authorization to Proceed (ATP) contract from an undisclosed customer to start work on a new Non-Geostationary Orbit (NGSO) satellite constellation (valued at $180 million). The definitive contract for the full constellation (valued at around $750 million) is expected in 2024. We can hope for the unnamed customer to be linked to Apple's new investment since the contract and the constellation' valuations both make sense, price wise, with the total investment made by Apple's and the $1.1 billion payments that will be made to Globalstar in order to help them fund the new constellation. The timeline between the ATP with MDA and Apple's announcement for their new investment also both make sense. However, if that contract actually turns out to be tied to Apple's new investment, I'm not really optimistic on the fact that Rocket Lab is still involved in the spacecraft bus manufacturing.
3. Because Apple's main objective with their new investment is to improve space-based communications for iPhones, I see this new investment as an extension to their first partnership with Globalstar back in 2022. That being said, I think it would make sense if Globalstar continues to use Rocket Lab's constellation-class ground software for their new satellite constellation because from my understanding, the new constellation's purpose is to act as a complement to the one currently operated. 
4. Globalstar didn't want to elaborate on the upgrades their new constellation would bring to space-based communications on iPhones. By looking at RKLB's old press releases about the 2022 contract, I've found this very precise sentence: ""These new satellites and SOCC will augment Globalstar’s existing constellation delivering reliable mobile satellite voice and data services from space."" However, Globalstar's current constellation does not \*yet\* provide more bandwidth-hungry services such as voice and broadband as of today. Is it possible that the new satellites partly built by RKLB would provide such an upgrade to GlobalStar's currently offered services? 

I'd like to know what you guys think and feel free to share your opinion!

What percent of your portfolio is RKLB?,"With the recent run-up RKLB has increased to be roughly 6% of my portfolio. If it performs anywhere close to what we expect it to over the next decade it’ll be very difficult for me to invest enough elsewhere to keep at a reasonable level of my 30sh stock portfolio. And yes of course I want to buy more but want to keep a balanced portfolio. Will be a great problem to have but also pretty risky. I imagine some here have I higher allocation and am curious to hear your thoughts.

New Zealand And UK Agree Blueprint For Satellite Removal And Servicing Missions,"This news has gotten less attention. As some estimate LEO can handle of the order of 100,000 satellites before elevated risk to the Kessler effect, servicing, replacing and removal of satellites will become an ongoing big market.

Since there is a constellation gold rush to LEO with Starlink, Kuiper, OneWeb, IRIS, Chinese 30k cluster, Globalstar, PlanetLab, ASTS, ICEYE, SDA,  BlackSky, E-Space, Kineis, etc. it will be very busy up there.

And as the New Zealand orbital rocket company list is not very long, especially with dedicated small launch and Victus Haze mission type LEO precision rendezvous skills, this UK NZ deal is worth mentioning as an example of things (read: RKLB business) to come.

Not astrology! Promise!!!  Just sharing what I have been watching on the latest uptrend…,"Not an astrologer.

(Post is) Not really a conversation starter or anything too noteworthy, but sharing because it does display strength and accumulation. 

Nfa though. I’m sharing something that reinforces my thesis. Rocket Lab will be 100$ a share and it won’t be a pump and dump (long time from now, but it’s happening).

This is how I know.

Connecting the chart / daily price action, and the accumulation that has happened on this uptrend... 

When share price has dipped to the low end of a range (chart flattens out for a week or so), I have noticed large scale orders spike (not retail buys, massive buys). Noticed the same thing when the candles trade sideways on each step of the staircase on this last rise. The large orders hit the tape on the lower end of the price range. Then, share price takes the next step up.

Like I said, nothing noteworthy. What it displays though can give you, us dumb money retail investors, a little more confidence in holding your shares. You selling isn’t going to really do anything to the price, not trying to sell you on my thesis…. but maybe it will help you not bail on an opportunity to change your financial situation without doing anything… Don’t get scared out of your position. 

The spikes on the price cost distribution chart display consolidation / institutional buying in at the low end of the trading range / building positions. 

To connect the images simply…

First image displays the daily chart, each candle is 1 day. The sideways price action is accumulation and is directly correlated to the spikes on the “cost distribution chart in second image. Then the last image displays the order flow for today. Notice the large scale orders. That is not retail investors. That is institutional buying and they hold their shares for a very long time. This allows share price to keep going up. Gradually, and not without dips.

Blackrock owned 4.9% of the company (just under disclosure requirements / 13 g). They bought another 1.1% of the company (disclosed last week, think they have 15 -30 days to file the 13). Yes they own everything, but a ~6% position is not to be ignored.

More institutions will follow. Current institutional ownership is just over 57%. Has increased steadily since the decrease in inst ownership when Kholsa distributed shares / lock-up ended. That was when price was ~ 4.50. 

If something negative happens (news / launch failure) look at the spike on the price cost distribution chart below the one we are at now. That is what stock astrologers call support levels. Buy more then. Usually takes another negative event to break that one.

This is the easiest money I have ever made. I’m just a science teacher. Money for nothing is welcomed. 

You do you, but hope you make money. There is plenty to go around. Would hate to see institutions make that money instead of you all reading Reddit posts on a Thursday night.

RKLB MSR odds increased due to Elon’s recent actions. ,"I firmly believe that all of Elons recent shenanigans (getting very political very quickly, paying for votes, claims he’s talking to Putin, etc.) are only going to help RKLB. NASA administrator Nelson believes that these claims about Elon should be investigated and I believe there’s a growing anti-monopoly mindset around SpaceX right now in this industry. 

Therefore, I think that NASA is more likely to choose RKLB over SpaceX for MSR due to wanting to help get other launch providers up to a near-SpaceX level quicker. 

But they won’t just do this out of kindness, I also cannot see any other realistic candidate with RKLBs interplanetary track record. The only other real competitor (other than SpaceX) is BO and they just don’t have the resume for this. Unless their application was joint with many other organizations, I just don’t see them getting MSR. 

We should be thanking Elon for his stupidity. 

Fingers crossed we get this…

Mars Sample Return Mission Abstract - Rocket Lab's (former NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory) Richard French,"Everyone here has heard about the NASA Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission for which Rocket Lab is carrying out a study, which may lead to a NASA contract for either a full mission or some parts thereof. 

Let's take a look at Richard French, the Rocket Lab's man who is mentioned in the MSR studies abstracts of selected proposals published by NASA. Mr. French was mentioned in the Rocket Lab's news article of 2024/09/05 as a decorated NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) lead system engineer who, among other achievements, helped land the Curiosity Rover on Mars:, before moving to a managerial role at NASA HQ and later JPL's STO:

>Rocket Lab, the global leader in dedicated small satellite launch, has appointed Richard French to the role of Director – Global Government Launch Services. Joining Rocket Lab **following 12 years at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)**, Mr. French’s new role will see him focus on providing launch and on-orbit solutions for United States civil space customers such as NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as international civil space customers.

>In his previous role at NASA JPL, **Mr. French spent several years as an engineer working across various missions**, including the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission (for which he won the **NASA Honors Early Career Public Achievement Medal** for his work as **a lead system engineer**) **and** **helping to land the Curiosity Rover on Mars**. After moving into **a managerial role in the Space Technology Mission Directorate at NASA HQ, and then JPL’s Space Technology Office**, he made significant contributions in implementing public-private partnerships with companies like Blue Origin, Astrobotic Technology, and Made in Space, and helped stand up NASA’s first start-up accelerator program with Techstars.

>(...)

>“Richard’s extensive experience at NASA and his work on commercial and government partnerships made him the obvious choice to lead government services at Rocket Lab,” says Lars Hoffman, Senior Vice President – Global Launch Services. “Rocket Lab is proud to offer frequent, reliable, and streamlined launch services to small satellite operators, and I’m looking forward to seeing Richard expand on Rocket Lab’s premium experience for our government customers.”

>Mr. French says: “I’m excited for the opportunity to continue enabling government agency space missions, but this time from the industry side and with the leading dedicated small satellite launch provider. I’m looking forward to building on the already impressive capabilities of Rocket Lab for government missions and working with government agencies to better support the expansion of commercial space.”

To the Ones Sleeping on RKLB,"A few months ago I stumbled upon RKLB and it was hella low… but I never pulled the trigger. As of late it’s been moving and so naturally i’ve been looking into it more and more and wanted to get a feel for how it stacks up against the competition (This is just for people who are relatively new… very obvious info). Rocket Lab is up against companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and some smaller guys like Astra and Firefly Aerospace.
 
Obviously Musk is the big dawg of the commercial space sector, with a $210 billion valuation. They dominate the industry with cheap rideshare missions for small satellites, which is bad news for Rocket Lab since they’re targeting the same market. Pretty much…. SpaceX’s scale and success are the biggest threats to Rocket Lab, hands down…. especially with the funding they just pulled too.

Blue Origin, while worth around $12 billion because they have Bezos running the show, the company is absolute dogwater for now and 0 threat. They are yet to surpass a suborbital launch lmao.

Now, Astra and Firefly are smaller but focused on launching small satellites at low costs. They’re not doing as many launches as Rocket Lab, but they could be disruptive by offering cheaper alternatives in the future but for now it's nothing crazy.

One company in this whole commercial space industry that kinda made me pause was Virgins Orbit. To really understand Rocket Lab’s position, I started looking into Virgin Orbit’s story. Basically for some background, they were another promising company in the small satellite market, valued at around $200 million before going bankrupt in 2023. This got me thinking though… was Virgin Orbit ever worth more? Turns out, at its peak, Virgin Orbit was valued at around $3.7 billion because of the hype around their air-launch system.

That’s when I started to feel a little nervous. If Virgin Orbit, a company once worth billions, could go bankrupt, what about Rocket Lab? With a current valuation of $5.5 billion, it’s not that far off. Given how tough the space industry is (super high costs, tons of competition, substantial loss when things go bad, etc), it’s a fair question to ask if Rocket Lab could face a similar fate.

After digging deeper (GPT search is goated for this), I found some key reasons Rocket Lab is way more robust and unlikely to follow in Virgin Orbit’s footsteps:

* Unlike Virgin Orbit, which struggled with consistent operations and reliability, Rocket Lab has a proven record of successful launches. As of now, Rocket Lab has completed dozens of successful Electron launches, building customer confidence and expanding its market share. Looking at Virgin Orbit…. Basically they had only completed a handful of launches and faced way more technical issues. Rocket Lab's reliability in delivering payloads on time and at a competitive cost is a significant advantage over the difficulties Virgin Orbit experienced.  
* Rocket Lab is not solely dependent on launch services. It has successfully diversified into spacecraft design, satellite components, and satellite management services, which provide additional revenue streams. This strategic diversification helps mitigate the risks associated with relying solely on launch operations, which was one of Virgin Orbit’s weaknesses. Virgin Orbit primarily focused on air launch technology.  
* Rocket Lab has future projects like the development of the Neutron rocket, which will allow it to compete in the medium-lift launch market, giving it access to larger payloads and way more lucrative contracts. At this point… Virgin Orbit was still trying to establish itself in the smaller payload market when it encountered financial troubles (so they weren't even able to get past logistics). . Additionally, Rocket Lab has been working on reusability with Electron, which could further reduce costs and increase profitability over time, a significant factor that Virgin Orbit lacked.  
* Rocket Lab has raised significant capital and managed its finances well, with plans to grow its business strategically. Virgin Orbit, despite its initial $3.7 billion valuation, faced liquidity issues and struggled to raise funds, eventually leading to bankruptcy. Rocket Lab’s revenue has been growing steadily, and while it is not yet profitable, the company's long-term plans for increasing revenue through more launches, satellite services, and new rocket developments give it a clearer path to profitability than Virgin Orbit ever had.  
* The demand for small and medium satellite launches is growing due to the rise of satellite constellations for communications, earth observation, and defence. Rocket Lab is well positioned to capitalise on this, having established itself as a trusted provider. Virgin Orbit’s limited ability to scale and capture a significant portion of this growing market played a role in its downfall.

So yeah, while I had some initial concerns comparing Rocket Lab to Virgin Orbit’s downfall, it’s clear that Rocket Lab is in a much stronger spot

In response to the bears (aka the liberal arts bull case for RKLB),"A few days ago I had an exchange with a guy who posted various pics Archimedes vs Raptor rockets.   A link to the thread ( https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/s/HOahYRJsur ), but the guy’s comments were deleted either by himself or the mods(?).  

In any event, it started out as just one of any number of posts going on about space x being so far ahead that nobody can compete.  I think the poster was a provocateur but also argued in good faith.  I found him to be broadly representative of a demographic of investor whose biases (technical snobbery and industry experience) are commonly found in arguments against Rocket Lab.  I think that those points are worth further discussion. 

I’m NOT an engineer (and this poster snidely pointed this out, in response to my comment that I don’t care about Archimedes looking like a wiry mess compared to Raptor).  I’m also not a quant of any type.  I focus on soft factors - culture, broad market structure, political and social movements.  I am a liberal arts shit head investor, and am proud to be one.  I was on NVIDIA in early 2022 (after many techies, yes,  but still before the market as a whole) because I read some novels about AI and read about GPT 3.  Not to toot my own horn, but focusing on soft factors like “how will other people perceive this technology?” and “where are the potential bottlenecks in developing it?” and “what companies are critical to this but have relatively low overall public awareness?” were critical to pointing me to Nvidia.  Much of the same analysis points me to Rocket Lab.

“Rocket Lab is technically inferior to Space X”.  Nobody disputes this. I take it as a given.  There is a wide gulf.  But does it matter?  Only if the technological gap cannot be overcome in the long run.  Why would Space X have an insurmountable technological moat?  It could only be one of three reasons:

1. The tech is too hard to replicate
2. The talent for developing the tech will only be at Space X
3. Space X will drive its competitors out of business before they can attain technological parity. 

As to 1, this is not true.  Saturn V rockets have existed for like 50 years.  Building rockets is hard but it does not require any significant breakthrough in fundamental science to match Space X.  I think this is not controversial.  It’s a question of scaling, money, processes, quality control, not fundamental scientific knowledge. 

As to 2: the commenter argued something to the effect that given space X’s advantage, no engineer would want to work for RKLB. This , frankly , struck me as prime Boomer Logic.  We have seen time and again that top talent wants to take risks and get exposure to upside.  Yes many engineers like to work for a more established company, but many will simply want the challenge, glory, and financial rewards associated with working for start up (or in RKLBs case, a mature start up with room to run).  

As to 3: Beck himself often rightly points out that monopolies usually do not last in the long run.  While this is less true in extremely capital intensive industries , he is generally correct and his point is buttressed by 2 additional facts.  A) space is a national security issue and B) Space X is and must remain a privately held company ( if it is to continue to pursue its mars goal).

I asked the poster to tell me who controlled airplane manufacturing during World War 2.  He responded a small number of companies incestuously subcontracted with each other and later consolidated into a handful of mega contractors due to government intervention. He made my point for me.  Vital national defense concerns are never run by pure monopoly; oligopoly is the rule.  This is because the market is artificial.  The government cannot tolerate a single company having a chokehold on vital capacity such as launch and space systems manufacture.  It requires somewhat competitive bidding.  It requires redundancies.  It also requires its contractors to satisfy national security laws regarding sourcing, supply chain, secrecy, clearances, etc.  Rocket Lab has come farther than any of its direct competitors (other than, obviously, Space X) in terms of being able to satisfy the governments requirements and delivering a product that works as advertised.  At minimum, Rocket Lab can deliver components for other launch providers ; the best case is that it can be one of 3-4 major government contractors in terms of taking payloads into orbit. 

The private vs public structure is also quite important.  Public companies are subject to disclosure laws that do not apply to private companies.  Control is dispersed, not concentrated in one person or small group.  This is a superior governance structure for the purposes of winning public confidence and political support.  Space X cannot go public in the near term because its stated goal of going to Mars will be severely compromised by introducing any form of outside governance.  I do take Musk at his word; mars is THE objective. Thus, it must remain in the hands of an idiosyncratic billionaire with many political enemies.  All the more reason for US and world governments to foster competition and incubate alternatives. 

None of this is to say that rocket lab will come out as one of the favored group of competitors- it is still a long, hard road with a lot of risk.  But I do not buy the thesis that SpaceX is untouchable and I do believe that RKLB is one of the top contenders.",102,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1g8mmdo/in_response_to_the_bears_aka_the_liberal_arts/

SpaceX recently earned a large contract with the Department of Defence for $775 million.  However in the same article the DoD confirmed that Rocket Lab (as well as others) are expected to bid for future launches.  

From prior news releases, we all know Rocket Lab appears to have a good working relationship and recognizes it’s a major future business as they created a dedicated National Security subsidiary.

Phase 3 Lane 1 - Damn that’s some JUICY launch money ,"https://spacenews.com/spacex-secures-new-contracts-worth-733-5-million-for-national-security-space-missions/

Any newbs out there that don’t know this, RocketLab last year had had to punt being on boarded because they no longer had a credible path to launch in 2024.

I think it’s pretty obvious right now that a path to launch in 2025 is extremely credible and in a years time they should be scoring some of these contracts.

These are yearly awards, so for shit and giggles let’s say Neutron scores half these launches.

4 launches at probably 70 to 80 million (DoD are extra juicy compared to a standard 55 million dollar launch.) That revenue is what RocketLab has made this entire year so far. 

I get distracted dreaming about MSR and the current stock price, but Neutron scaling is such a big deal. So much Cheddar.

"All these posts about how RKLB is ""overvalued"".","I'm seeing so many posts about RKLB being overvalued. How it's not worth $5B today because it doesn't have the revenues to support that valuation. These posters are missing the point. You, I, analysts, pundits, space enthusiasts, or market experts don't decide what a stock is worth. Only the market decides what stocks are ""worth"". And currently it's saying that RKLB is worth 5B today not because of what it's actually intrinsically worth, but because that the chance of it being worth 25, 50, 100B+ in a few years is becoming more and more likely.

A lottery ticket is a piece of paper worth nothing intrinsically. You don't buy it for the value of the paper. You buy it because it comes with the opportunity for it to later actually be worth a large amount of money.

It's fine if you want to trade RKLB and try and call the tops and bottoms. Honestly I do that with about 5% of my position, it keeps me engaged with the stock price and I don't feel like I'm missing out on taking some profits. But I'm holding 95% of my position long term, because I know this stock will eventually start running and not slow down. RKLB is doing everything right and has proven itself over and over in the past. The general public is just starting to catch on.

Trade RKLB if you want, but know that you're risking the guaranteed bag that's sitting right there if you simply buy and hold.",88,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1g6i4u5/all_these_posts_about_how_rklb_is_overvalued/

Why companies like $RKLB succeed in G2M even though existing players have the stronger balance sheet,"Large companies often fail in emerging markets due to their inability to adapt to changing technologies, consumer preferences, or market conditions. Of the original 12 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in 1900, only two have survived. **U.S. Leather** dissolved in 1911, as the demand for leather declined with the rise of synthetic materials and changing manufacturing needs​. Similarly, **Tennessee Coal & Iron** was acquired by U.S. Steel during the Panic of 1907, as it struggled with financial instability and competition​.

**American Cotton Oil**, which later became part of Unilever, shifted focus from cotton oil to food and consumer products, but it initially failed to capitalize on emerging industrial and chemical trends​. **American Tobacco** lost its dominance due to anti-trust laws that split the Tobacco Trust in 1911, reducing its market share and power​.

**Distilling & Cattle Feeding** was a major player in alcohol production, but Prohibition in 1920 crippled the company, forcing it to pivot to chemicals and eventually become Millennium Chemicals, losing its original market​. **National Lead** shifted from lead production to titanium dioxide, but its failure to keep pace with environmental regulations and new technologies saw it lose relevance​.

These companies failed to adapt to new market dynamics, competition, and regulatory challenges making way for new enterprises as we are now witnessing in the new space era with $ASTS and $RKLB emerging as key players.",19,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1g3ldw8/why_companies_like_rklb_succeed_in_g2m_even/

Tbh. that news is shocking. BlueOrigin spend billions of dollars and years of development (development started in 2011, was announced in 2014, first launch in January 2024) and right now they need 10 days to produce 1 engine?  
RocketLab started development of Archimedes in 2021, as a ox rich cycle in September 2022.  
We won't come by exact production numbers, but my educated guess is that they are currently producing about 1 engine per month.

In the Q2 earnings presentation they wrote that engine 2 were coming off the production line. 5 more were in production. And as Peter Beck wrote in context with the recent Archimedes video, engine number 3 already should fix the copper issue.

SpaceX has been so far out in front that one would think they wouldn’t be afraid of competition but they clearly are.  This is an actual filing by SpaceX.  It is clear that their CEO thinks they should be the only game in town.  Why would he care what ASTS stock has done when TSLA stock was one of the best from 2010-2020?  He basically burned $34B buying Twitter  which is over 6X the market cap of Rocket Lab or ASTS.

"If Trump wins, I'm selling.","I started thinking about the election and How it could affect Rocket Lab. And it dawned on me. Trump and Elon are best buddies. Of course Elon is going to use a Trump administration to kill off competition. Trump will direct every mission, NASA and DOD to SpaceX. He could even use the EPA to deny launch permits to any other company (who cares if it's BS, this is Trump world). This could kill Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, Axiom, Sierra, Relativity and any company that could compete with SpaceX in the future. This would be a tragedy for the whole industry that is just getting started. ULA will probably survive because they have been around the longest and have their own friends on capitol hill. But it will just be those two around SpaceX and ULA under Trump, that's my prediction.

On the Flip side if Kamala gets in I think they will actively divest from SpaceX wherever they can, due to Elon dislike. They'll be stuck using Dragon for a while because it's the most proven vehicle in the US (RIP Starliner). But I could see Dream Chaser getting another look from NASA.

A revelation I’ve come to realise,"One of the biggest unknowns we’ve had about Neutrons commercial success, is how well it will actually compete with Falcon 9. I for example, have always been hopeful, but a bit unsure about the fact that Neutron can only put 13 Tons into LEO in reusable configuration, compared to a much higher offering from Falcon 9.

Until the penny dropped that Falcon 9 is a mature design that’s been in production and service for well over a decade, and has seen many iterations and evolutions over it’s life.

I searched it up, Falcon 9s first ever iteration “v1.0” could only put 9 tonnes into LEO, and it wasn’t reusable. The second iteration “v1.1” could put 13 tonnes into LEO, and wasn’t reusable. It wasn’t until v1.2 came about in 2015 that it could then put 18.5 tons into LEO in reusable configuration and 22.8 Tons into LEO as an expendable rocket. It then later got refined into its next iteration “Block 5”, but it’s payload capacity stayed the same, and the en you’ve got Falcon Heavy which obviously has the higher capacities again.

So when you compare this to Neutron, it’s starting out brilliantly already. Considering Neutron is a foetus and Falcon 9 is a fully matured vehicle by now, and even so, F9 in its current state can only put 5.5 more tons into orbit than Neutron can (with both in LEO reusable configuration respectively). 

It’s safe to assume that as Neutron and Archimedes go through the development process and receive updates/iterations as it goes through its life and matures, that Neutron will be a very strong contender to Falcon 9. I mean, we already know that Archimedes in it’s current stage of life, will be operated at pretty low stress levels. And even at low stress levels, it’s starting considerably further ahead than where Falcon 9 started its life. Over the years of neutron being in service, when Rocket Lab refine and improve on their base design of neutron, when they learn more about Archimedes and how far they can push it whilst still being reliable to launch again and again and again, it seems safe to assume that Neutrons payload capacity will see decent payload improvements.

But my main point to realise is that Neutron is starting its life, leaps and bounds ahead of where Falcon 9 started its life, in terms of payload capacity and the fact that it will be reusable right from the outset. Obviously, this isn’t all down to Peter Beck masterclass, it’s been over a decade since F9 came to life, and technology has moved on since then. Still though, with this in mind, I feel a lot more confident about the argument of “How will Neutron compete with Falcon 9”. 

Will we see a neutron heavy? I doubt it but I’d love to be proven wrong in 5-10 years time. But with this in mind, not even taking into account that certain clients may pick rocket lab purely because it’s the only option that isn’t Elon Musk, AND the fact that Rocket Lab will offer end to end space services unlike SpaceX, AND the fact that Rocket Lab missions are tailored to their customers better and have a more precise orbit insertion, I think it’s pretty reasonable to assume that Neutron will at the very least, give Falcon 9 a good run for their money. 

The only thing that does still worry me slightly is that Falcon 9 has more than paid off for it’s self by now, so SpaceX will be able to price gouge/undercut Rocket Lab as much as they want (within reason), and Rocket Lab can only lower their prices so far to match it, after all, they have years of neutron service ahead of them to pay off the development costs.",57,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fttb0l/a_revelation_ive_come_to_realise/
Huge component of the business not yet factored into share price,"I wanted to point out something that others have mentioned before, particularly Vince is Bullish:

Peter Beck has said more than once that Rocket Lab is aiming to launch 50% of their rockets for customers and 50% of their rockets for themselves. This is because one of the primary purposes of their business is to create some sort of space infrastructure akin to SpaceX’s Starlink - some type of constellation that provides a service with high value for customers and high profit margins for Rocket Lab.

SpaceX’s valuation ballooned (almost doubled) to $200B since Starlink has come online.

When ASTS simply mentioned their constellation contract with AT&T, their market cap 10x’d in 3 months (before they had put anything into space).

Rocket Lab is fully vertically integrated (ASTS had to use a SpaceX rocket to get their first 5 satellites for AT&T into orbit). Once Rocket Lab is ready to begin building their own constellation, they’ll be able to do it at significantly lower cost than ASTS.

The only reason Rocket Lab’s price hasn’t moved on these repeated announcements of Peter Beck’s 50/50 plan for the company is that they haven’t announced exactly what their constellation will be yet.

But anyone that knows this company can pretty safely assume it’ll be a success that drives huge profits.

Remember, ASTS moved 10x on news of a constellation. Rocket Lab has announced a constellation too but there’s been zero movement (recent movement is due to other reasons like Neutron progress and price upgrades).

Once they announce the purpose of their constellation and provide a roadmap with more details, the stock could easily 2-5x in a handful of months. This will almost certainly occur simultaneously with the first successful flight of neutron or shortly after (6-12 months).

RKLB Short Term Bear Thesis (Long Term Bull),"The intention of this post is to outline why I consider RKLB to be an outstanding company with an overvalued stock price. I’ve been lurking on this sub for quite some time, and I frequently see people making bold price projections for RKLB’s future stock price with little to no substance backing up their estimates. That being said, I would like to provide a detailed breakdown for why I believe RKLB’s fair value is approximately $6 per share right now. This is a short term (1 year or less) projection, not a long term projection. I look forward to hearing your feedback and seeing where we differ in opinion.

*Let’s start with the good stuff. This encapsulates basically everything but the stock price.*

**Strong Leadership**
Peter Beck is exactly the right person to be running this company. He has the perfect blend of intelligence, charisma, and modesty to make the company as successful as it has been. The track record of successful launches that RKLB has achieved is a tremendous achievement for someone that, unlike his main competitors (Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, Elon Musk), does not have more money than god. I also see no concerning loss of senior talent, and I've seen an ability to attract new talent in recent months. Quality leadership is the most important thing I look for in an investment, and RKLB appears to have that in spades.

**Successful Track Record**
As mentioned earlier, the track record RKLB has achieved with Electron has been spectacular. 53 launches with minimal failures speaks volumes about the quality of the engineering talent at RKLB. Unlike many other people that have a negative take on RKLB, I actually don’t think that Neutron will struggle to reach a successful track record of launches and profitability. The recent hot fire test of the Archimedes engine was impressive, and it appears RKLB is on track to meet their goals with Neutron.

**Positive Catalysts**
There are several catalysts which I believe could completely annihilate my expectations for RKLB’s stock to decline in the near to mid term. First, an overall increased interest in the space industry from the market as a whole. Markets are always looking for the next hot thing, and it’s entirely possible space could be that. Just like artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, SPACs, etc., the space industry at large could see a significant uptick in investor interest. This could lead to an increase in RKLB’s multiple and stock price without necessitating an increase in revenue or profitability. Secondly and tangentially, an IPO of SpaceX could greatly increase RKLB’s visibility in the market. I believe a SpaceX IPO would cause a rising tide that raises all ships in the space industry, and RKLB would benefit. Lastly, I believe RKLB has a substantial amount of “meme stock” potential. The company’s name has been spreading within the forums of people that invest in meme stocks, and it’s possible RKLB could be the next big one as many of those speculators lose faith in GME, AMC, etc.

*Now let’s talk about the negatives.*

**Revenue/Profitability**
I believe it is fairly easy to project out RKLB’s likely profitability over the next 1-3 years, and I don’t expect to see many positive surprises on either top line revenue or bottom line earnings. Revenue is rising, but predictably, and I don’t see any significant catalysts for revenue to surprise on the upside. The revenue isn’t explicitly a negative as revenue growth has been strong, but the stock price relative to revenue is beginning to become unsustainable. 

RKLB became public in 2021 through a SPAC so we can’t too far back with their financials. In 2020 with seven Electron launches, RKLB had $35MM in revenue or about $6MM per launch.  In 2021 with six launches, RKLB had about $62MM in revenue or about $10MM per launch. In 2022 with nine launches, RKLB had $211MM in revenue or about $23MM per launch. In 2023 with nine launches, RKLB had about $244MM in revenue or about $27MM per launch. For the last 12 months (June 2023-June 2024) across twelve launches, RKLB had about $326MM in revenue or about $27MM per launch. These numbers show strong growth in launch count, total revenue, and revenue per launch. As we all know, most of RKLB’s revenue is outside of launch services, but their ability to launch successfully is critical for their future ability to generate revenue and profitability across all their business lines. For the first half of 2024, RKLB had about $200MM in revenue and they are projecting about $100MM in the third quarter. For the full year, I am assuming they settle in around $400MM in revenue for the year. Very solid revenue growth compared to 2023.

That’s all positive, but the stock price as compared to that revenue is overheated, from my perspective. Based on most recent valuations, it appears the market leader in RKLB’s industry is currently valued at about 23x 2023 revenue or 15x projected 2024 revenue. Obviously, SpaceX is a private company that is valued differently than in the public markets, but this multiple seems reasonable for the industry’s profit margins and growth expectations. I’m aware that RKLB’s business lines aren’t identical to SpaceX’s, but I believe Wall Street will utilize similar logic when establishing an appropriate multiple for RKLB. However, given SpaceX’s dominance in the industry and the significant amount of execution risk remaining in RKLB’s growth trajectory, it would be appropriate to apply a lower multiple to RKLB to account for this risk. At a stock price of $10 or a market cap of about $4.9BB, RKLB is trading at a 20x multiple on 2023 revenue or 12x expected 2024 revenue. From my perspective, this is not a large enough discount compared to SpaceX. I believe that RKLB’s multiple should be no more than half of SpaceX’s - 11.5x 2023 revenue or 7.5x projected 2024 revenue. This would equate to a market capitalization of $2.8BB to $3.0BB. This range of market capitalizations would equate to a stock price of $5.50 to $6.00 per share.

**Psychological $10 Barrier**
As previously mentioned, RKLB IPO’ed through a SPAC merger back in 2021 at about $10 per share. After experiencing a large but short-lived pump in the share price, the stock quickly dove down to the $4-$5 range where it stayed for years. Investors that entered a RKLB position at IPO or in the immediate run-up post-IPO are finally seeing an opportunity to exit the shares of a company that has done nothing for them for years as the S&P, Dow and Nasdaq have hit record highs. That being said, I think $10 will be a very difficult barrier to break both for practical and psychological reasons. The vast majority of companies that IPO’ed via a SPAC are still trading below their IPO price today. Increases in the share price above $10 are likely to be short-lived as we saw on September 30th, the first trading day after public confirmation of the successful hot fire tests of the Archimedes engine. 

**Conclusion**
In summation, I believe RKLB’s share price is experiencing a short term pump above what I’d consider to be a sustainable market capitalization based on their current and future revenue expectations. I expect the shares to return to $6 range before year end. I do not expect the shares to return to the $4 range. In the spirit of disclosure, I should mention that I previously worked for a private equity company that still holds a substantial stake in RKLB and SpaceX, but I was not directly involved in the private equity arm of the company so I had no special access to their investment theses or MNPI. I do still own approximately $50,000 in equity shares of my previous company. As it relates to more direct RKLB-related investments, I have a number of November 2024 put options with a $7 strike price that I paid approximately $.20 per share for. In the event my investment thesis plays out as I expect, I intend to convert the profits from the put options into an equity stake in RKLB with a holding period of 5+ years.

Why I think RKLB is a hold ,"I'm seeing a lot of new people popping up in this sub talking about gainz for ants. Y'all shortsighted motherfuckers. Look at the macro picture: 

1. US/China space race heating up. China is seen as a ""pacing challenge"" by the US military. Last time this shit happened during the Cold War, NASA spending reached 4.5% of federal budget. 

2. NO to monopoly. National security shit is not allowed to have a monopoly. Spacex will never be the only player. And it's valued at 200 bil, almost 50x what rklb is worth.

3. The huge TAM of space services in general. Lunar exploration, mars, LEO sats, spy sats, LEO experimental medicine, low gravity manufacturing etc. A lot of it is speculative you say? Well that's what investing in tech is about aye? You're looking for the NEXT BIG THING, not the last big thing. You might as well do GEICO and Coca Cola if you're of that bent. 

4. Actual working rocket and workable path to another big ass rocket. How many other companies you know put their money where their mouth is and can execute to a high level. Shit, even bezos is fking up with blue origin. I have more confidence in someone who has actually made a rocket fly, than some shit that's still on the pad. 

5. A good underpromise over deliver CEO. Sir Beck doesn't shoot his mouth off. Wanna know what that means? It means if he's anything like Musk, share price would be a multiple of what it is with hype. And I'm all for execute first hype later. 

6. Improving macro environment. Last time we had a massive reduction in rates after 08, there's a boom for 10 years. 2011 to 2021 were some of the best times in the market. Now with lower rates, you bet your ass the rotation into small and mid caps is gonna happen. Not least because lower rates make capital raising and debt obligations a lot more manageable. 

7. In other words, I fking love the stock. Positions: 
16326 shares @ 4.04 and 69 Jan 2025 calls.

RKLB has high variance in possible outcomes in terms of return, hence by Jensen's inequality it must be overpriced currently.

RKLB is clearly in technological revolution category and while it may rise a lot in the near future, once it integrates into the economy and shifts from idiosyncratic to system risk, it may all deflate in the end.

Cash and equivalents after reaching $8.04,"Thanks to u/wfriedma for the reminder, that with the price over $8.04, the capped calls Rocket Lab purchased a while ago should now be relevant again.

This is all from memory, and from my understanding of things, so take it with a grain of salt, but I think the current share price should now mean that Rocket Lab has about $700 million in cash and equivalents (rather than the ~$500 million they had at the end of Q2).

This is because the convertible notes that Rocket Lab issued were for about 69 million shares with a conversion price of $5.13. So that was to raise about $350 million dollars, that they will eventually have to settle either with cash or the 69 million shares (or some combination of the two).

To try to reduce the possibility of the full amount of dilution needing to happen to settle/redeem the notes, Rocket Lab also bought call options capped at $8.04.

The idea with those call options was that they would allow Rocket Lab to settle the convertible notes entirely with cash, without needing to pay more than the original ~$350 million principal amount, and without needing to issue any shares, up to the point of the share price being $8.04. Any higher than that and they'd need to either issue shares as well to completely settle the notes, or pay more cash beyond the original ~$350 million plus the proceeds from the call options.

In other words, the point of the capped calls was to allow Rocket Lab to pay back ""for free"" to the holders of the notes the difference between $5.13 and $8.04 per share for ~69 million shares (obviously not actually for free, the capped calls cost something like $50 million), if the share price happened to be at $8.04 when the notes were due.

So by my understanding, that works out to a maximum of about $200 million in proceeds from the capped calls, which should have been available to Rocket Lab as soon as the share price was above $8.04, i.e. today.

Saying that ~$200 million will now be added to their balance sheet is not taking into account whatever value the calls had on their balance sheet at the end of Q2 though, so I would expect my $200 million number here could be a bit too high, but it should be in the ballpark.

But the main point is, Rocket Lab should be in a significantly better cash position now, because of this latest surge in the share price.",31,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fpih3t/cash_and_equivalents_after_reaching_804/

Anyone here holding LUNR and RDW aswell as RKLB?,"I’ve finally pulled the trigger and put some money in the space stocks, and I’ve gone for RKLB, LUNR and RDW, with RKLB being the biggest holding of the 3.

My train of thought was, the more these companies grow and develop, get more cash behind them, capture more share of the growing space market etc, that these 3 combined will be absolutely raking the contracts in. RKLB for launch and end to end space services, Redwire for development and construction of higher end speciality space tech (their space 3d printing will be a huge bread winner imo, and then all their general high quality infrastructure like their solar cells, robotic arms, cameras, sensors, RF transmitters, in space manufacturing, their space greenhouses etc), and LUNR could/will be the go to company for getting your things on to the moon surface which is essential and they’re one of the only ones offering actual payload delivery to the moon surface (can’t see many commercial avenues for this currently but now space is more accessible than ever, I predict that america will want to have some amount of control over the moon surface, before China gets there first, I’d imagine establishing moon dominance will become a bit of a strategic/geopolitical thing)

Obviously this is all wildly speculative and a very, very high risk play. But in the long run (im thinking 15 years +), if these 3 are still around by that point, they’ll be space giants and there’ll always be one of the three receiving a contract for something. Obviously spacex will be hoovering up contracts too, but I still think that in the long term, these 3 will be consistentently winning more and more contracts and are probably positioned to be giants in the market when it inevitably consolidates.

What does the next year look like for Rocket Lab?,"Hi all,

Despite having owned RKLB shares for a few years now (bought around $10 in 2021 alas) when the stock went down and ended up in the 'forget about it for a few years' corner of my portfolio I, well, forgot about it and took my eye off the ball.

I have been aware over the past several months the stock has done well, and I remain a keen supporter, but would anyone mind giving me an idea as to catalysts etc over the next year? 

I'm looking to buy some in my secondary portfolio at some point soon, but I am hoping to get in nearer $6 if I can. Is this realistic?

I've been in ASTS as long as I have RKLB, so I'm well used to the volatility, and is why I'm assuming RKLB is likely to experience a pull back when attention drifts away from the space sector

3 Millionaire-Maker Space Stocks

Historically, space exploration and putting satellites into orbit has been within the purview of government-funded agencies like NASA.

That's changing, though. For-profit corporations can handle this work at least as cost-effectively as government-run organizations can. Elon Musk's SpaceX recently facilitated the world's first-ever private citizen spacewalk, for example, while Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is mainstreaming space tourism. Blue Origin's newest rocket will even soon be launching two Mars probes for NASA.

This is only the beginning of privatized work in outer space, now that technology not only allows for it, but necessitates it. Market research outfits Polaris and Precedence agree that launch services alone will be roughly a $50 billion-per-year business within a decade. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley and Citi both predict that the entirety of the science, technology, and services businesses linked to space will be worth on the order of $1 trillion by 2040.

Connect the dots. There's real investment opportunity here.

The top opportunities, however, aren't likely to be the obvious names. The potential millionaire-making space stocks are likely to be the lower-profile stocks that could even be considered a little off the radar. Here's a closer look at three of your better bets among such prospects.



Rocket Lab USA

It may not be a household name, but Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ: RKLB) has been very busy for quite some time now. Since its very first launch in May 2017, this company has put over 190 satellites into orbit. Its technology (like software, solar panels, radios, etc.) is also found inside more than 1,700 different satellites, as well as the James Webb Space Telescope. The two aforementioned Mars probes will also be flying with Rocket Lab tech on board.

While there's a clear market for satellite launches, Rocket Lab's been at it for a while. For any ticker to offer real millionaire-making potential, the company must mostly be undiscovered. That, or it needs to be doing something new that most investors don't yet fully appreciate. In this case it's the latter.

To date, all of this company's launches have utilized its so-called Electron rocket. It's perfectly fine for putting small satellites into orbit, but it's not powerful enough to lift larger satellites, exploration craft, or people into space.

That's coming, though. The Neutron rocket expected to start flying next year will be a so-called medium-lift vehicle capable of carrying bigger machinery. In fact, it will even be able to provide the initial liftoff for missions to Mars and Venus. The Neutron rocket will also be reusable, making it cost-effective for the company as well as its customers. Perhaps most important, the soon-to-launch Neutron rocket will provide real competition to SpaceX, which currently dominates the medium-lift market.

And interest is definitely firming up even before its first commercial flight. The U.S. Space Force has already provided funding to co-develop an upper stage of Rocket Lab's Neutron rocket as part of the Department of Defense's efforts to ensure it's able to secure and defend the United States wherever and however it needs to.



AST SpaceMobile

AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ: ASTS) isn't nearly as far along as Rocket Lab USA is on the commercialization front. In fact, the company only recently launched its first-ever commercial satellites. These certainly won't be the last, however, now that the underlying technology has been proven and perfected.

It's not an apples-to-apples comparison. Whereas Rocket Lab designs tech for others' satellites as well as a means of putting them into orbit, as the name implies, AST SpaceMobile offers mobile broadband connectivity via satellites rather than cellphone towers. This tech is capable of connecting anyone to the worldwide web regardless of where they are -- no physical infrastructure (other than a functioning, web-capable phone) required.

At first blush, it seems like a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. You likely don't have any trouble connecting to the web, whether that be with your phone or a computer. That's not necessarily the norm, however, and that line of thinking underestimates a growing challenge.

See, as the world becomes increasingly connected -- including our cars -- our telecom infrastructure is being pushed to its limits. Much of the developed world is now running low on radio frequencies to assign to mobile phones and cell towers. Offloading this data traffic to fiberoptic connections has certainly helped, but handling such constant switchovers en masse can be technically complex as well, and still won't fully meet future needs.

There's also the not-so-small matter that such connectivity frameworks are vulnerable to power outages and other sorts of disruption.

Satellite-based connectivity, however, sidesteps many of those problems. It's not exactly a new idea, either. Even if not always practical or affordable for the average consumer, satellite-driven mobile phone connectivity has been around since the 90s.

Now that it's practical as well as affordable, Polaris Market Research believes this market is poised to grow at an average annual pace of 18% through 2032. AST SpaceMobile is smack-dab in the middle of this mainstreaming movement.


Intuitive Machines

Last but not least, add Intuitive Machines (NASDAQ: LUNR) to your list of space-related stocks that could turn out to be millionaire makers.

In some ways, Intuitive Machines is the riskiest of the three stocks in question simply due to its small size and young age. Its market capitalization is a mere $375 million, and while it's now producing annual revenue in the same ballpark following its founding in 2013, it's also still operating in the red with only a little over $30 million worth of cash in the bank.

In other ways, though, Intuitive Machines is arguably the least risky of these three stocks just because it's also operating the most practical, currently marketable business. Simply put, this company is helping for-profit organizations and government agencies get back to the Moon. Whether that's drones that land on the Moon to map it or a means of putting communication satellites in a lunar orbit, Intuitive Machines has a solution.

It's prescient, too, given that the Moon has moved back into focus as the world's next space-exploration point of interest, perhaps as a place to mine or colonize, or perhaps as a test run for a manned mission to Mars.

Indeed, NASA's Artemis rocket designed specifically to return mankind to the Moon is still slated to do so sometime in the latter part of 2025 or 2026. This voyage will partially be made possible with the help Intuitive Machines has already provided and will provide in the future. The company recently announced a $117 million contract to deliver six different payloads to the Moon for NASA.

This is still just the beginning. Analysts believe growing interest in Moon trips will drive enough revenue growth for Intuitive Machines to push it out of the red and into the black by 2026. Reaching that milestone could easily send this stock on a rocket ride, so to speak.

Blue Origin New Glenn,"Imo this is the only major near term challenge for RKLB in terms of stock price. Per management, Blue is targeting 10 launches in 2025 and 20+ in 2026. Now that's obviously optimistic but given that New Shepherd has been successful (suborbital), it seems likely that Blue has the ability to reach orbit successfully. Whether it's 2025 or 2026, at some point pretty soon they'll be launching NG at decent cadence. Different from Stoke or Relativity which are doing interesting things but hasn't proven to to be able to go orbital which is as hard as making an engine (or harder). Most of these launches will be for Kuiper now and going forward so there's plenty of business left for Neutron. I'm not worried about that. But I do think that the probable success of New Glenn is a potential overhang on RKLB stock price appreciation. Thoughts?",9,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fj7arb/blue_origin_new_glenn/

Why I am staying put through the end of year in Rocketlab,"We are reaching the end of quarter. There is one more launch this week. With that being successful, we meet all expectations. Even this launch fails it's not a big deal. We have seen both failures and resilience in Electron launches. Resilience is always rewarded.

  
Having said that, we are going to next quarter with strong tailwinds and no headwinds.

1. Increase in backlog or positive commentary on future launch opportunities 
2. These will be, well choreographed presentations. Very little risk
   1. Stage 1 static fire
   2. Stage 2 static fire
   3. Final Integration
   4. Wet Dress Rehearsal

Any positive announcement would be a catalyst for the stock to take off. **Optimism** is also a catalyst to drive higher.

-“ I think we can get there (50% gross margin) without reusablity, before I had my doubts, but if we’re doing 30 launches a year I think we can pretty safely get their without reuseable “

HASTE price tag?,"The other day Adam Spice mentioned the HASTE missions are the quickest growing stream in the electron portfolio.  I find this to be a very difficult business stream to get info on (I recognize many of the missions are confidential which may be why).  Does anyone know:
1) how much rocket lab charges for HASTE missions?  I’m guessing more than the $8.2m per launch for a standard electron rocket. 
2) exactly what the purpose of these missions is? It doesn’t seem like they’re payload missions deploying satellites for clients. I see many times they are defense-oriented but does anyone know exactly what that means? Are they ultimately going to be used as hypersonic missiles?  Testing for missile defense?  Don’t understand the use case for HASTE from the client side.

Question,"I live in Korea and in Korean sites, a number of people are concerned about RKLB because Trump said he will appoint Elon as ‘government efficiency commission’ if he becomes president.

Basically, they are worried because according to them(Koreans) Peter allegedly said that Elon is trying to suppress competitors like Rocket Lab in this field and that he is interfering w RKLB’s foothold in the industry by doing things such as lowering the launch price of the small-mounted vehicles etc.

As a result, Koreans w RKLB stocks are concerned about Trump being president since if Elon Musk takes up the government position, there is a very high possibility that he will use legal methods to push Spacex and suppress the competitions like Rocket Lab (according to them).

I want to ask if this is substantiated or just over-speculation/conspiracy by Koreans since I haven’t seen people in this Sub talk about this(or maybe you guys did and I didn’t see it).

The Intangibles are important - and its looking better for Rocket Lab,"I kinda feel sorry for SpaceX lately.  They have done some fantastic engineering and I’m sure have a lot of great people but their CEO and 50% owner has become a huge distraction.  The new private space race is in its infancy so a good head start isn’t enough.  Maintaining superiority in an industry over decades is difficult.  Do you know how many auto manufactures didn’t make it?  If you want to see what negative publicity can do to a superior product, go read the story of Preston Tucker or watch the movie.  

If Musk had just kept the problem to X, it would probably be fine but now he is using Starlink to defy the Brazilian Government.  I know that their government involved Starlink first but instead of backing down he is doubling down.  This could have long term ramifications if worldwide governments think Musk has no respect for their laws and start to put laws in place to limit his power in their countries.  I can guarantee these discussions are happening.  

The other problem for SpaceX now is their CEO decided to bet on one horse instead of just remaining neutral.  If his horse loses, there is no way he will see support from a Harris/Walz administration.  Musk is posting pictures of Harris as a Russian General…such a dumb move if you really want government contracts. I’m sure there are people in SpaceX that have left or are thinking of leaving because they don’t want to work for Musk anymore.  Again….that will benefit Rocket lab and Blue Origin and maybe a few of the other startups looking to scale quickly.

Blue Origin and Rocket Lab are poised to take advantage of these missteps by Musk.  That is why you see nothing about the election from Bezos and Beck because they are much smarter and know that to overtake SpaceX at this point you just put your head down and do the work.  There isn’t any need to attack Musk…he is lighting himself on fire.",208,25,https://i.redd.it/y80va2ienlmd1.jpeg

I am tempted to sell now as I’m sure so many of us are. 

I’m not selling because Rocket Lab will be worth 20bil eventually. I have no doubt. I don’t think it’s going straight there now, but someday far in the future 40$ shares is fully reasonable (if the company realizes ambitions).

I have read absolutely everything there is to know about the company and people (many of the board members, especially like Beck as a person and Spice is also nice- he was CFO for Qualcomm (I believe, please correct me if I’m wrong, but he does have experience in the semi / chips industry and space chips (even if only for solar cells (which I don’t think they are). I think they are making and developing chips for satellite operation / control and other various space craft in future))

Regardless of the semis / chips, the other aspects of the company are all notably exceptional. There are 4 ish various space craft at the moment (see video where Beck introduces the new names, it is funny) 

YouTube search “Rocket Lab Spacecraft Family” link: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AxEMnB9m-uw

 They have small launch fairly nailed, but more valuable and fully overlooked / not priced in is the “space systems” sector. Space companies that operate just satellites (like Iridium and ASTS) have market caps that dwarf Rocket Lab. Rocket Lab does what they do too… 

A little personal background…
Rocket Lab is 5% of my investment $ (in addition to a teacher’s pension). I have 215k in a tax deferred annuity that collects 7% fixed return. 24% of my pay goes directly into the annuity. RKLB is a 20k$ investment with money iI don’t spend every couple weeks. RKLB is very high risk I am not looking with rose colored glasses. There are many risks (Not worried about losing it all because I have the fixed return account…

Anyway, i can’t pull myself to sell this time or after any rise in share price (will sell 1000 shares at 28.50.  now, I could take 11k profit…. That just isn’t why I’m here. 

Say less, I know. 

Thoughts?

Rocket Lab Owns 2/3 of the U.S. Launch Market -- That Isn't SpaceX,"https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/rocket-lab-owns-2-3-120000860.html

When Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB) reported second-quarter earnings last week, it ignited a multiday rally that sent its stock price soaring as much as 18%. And no wonder.

Sales at the small space rocket manufacturer soared 71% year over year, beating analyst forecasts. The per-share loss for the quarter was $0.08 -- not great -- but still better than the $0.10 loss that Wall Street forecast.

A historic quarter

In fact, Chief Executive Officer Peter Beck said Q2 was Rocket Lab's ""highest revenue quarter in company history"" -- no great surprise given that each succeeding quarter shows revenue growth. But Beck also said that Rocket Lab is seeing ""strong and growing demand for our launch services and space systems products,"" such as the Electron rocket, Photon kick stage spacecraft, and satellites built for the U.S. Space Force. The company is also making progress on new products to power profit in the future.

First and foremost among these are the new Neutron rocket, a medium-lift rocket that, in a unique twist on traditional design, encapsulates its second stage within a reusable first stage with an integrated (and also reusable) payload fairing.

In last week's press release, Rocket Lab highlighted the recent successful first hot fire test of the Archimedes engine, nine of which will be used to power Neutron's first stage. Four days later, Rocket Lab posted a ""how it started, how it's going"" photo comparison on X first showing CEO Beck standing next to a mockup of the then-just-announced Neutron concept vehicle, side by side with a completed half-fairing for a real-life Neutron rocket.

What's more, just one day earlier, Rocket Lab announced its 10th mission so far this year, the launch of a Capella Space satellite to orbit atop an Electron rocket. Crucially, this was the first launch for Capella since September 2023, when an anomaly in an Electron rocket's second stage resulted in a loss of the payload. The fact that Capella maintained its faith in Rocket Lab -- and that faith was vindicated with a successful launch over the weekend -- has to come as happy news for Rocket Lab shareholders.

SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and ULA -- in that order

So yes, it's been a busy few days for Rocket Lab, and jam-packed with good news. Now here's some less good news.

According to Beck, Rocket Lab's Electron has become ""the most frequently launched small rocket globally."" And so far this year, Rocket Lab is responsible for ""64% of all non-SpaceX orbital U.S. launches in 2024 to date."" That sounds impressive, but it comes with a big caveat. SpaceX orbital U.S. launches already number 79 (and probably more by the time this article publishes). Meanwhile, Rocket Lab's 64% amounts to only 10 launches total.

That actually gives you a better idea of the distance between No. 2 rocket launcher Rocket Lab and No. 3 United Launch Alliance (ULA has launched four times this year, making up about 28% of non-SpaceX orbital U.S. launches), than of how close Rocket Lab is to overtaking SpaceX.

Hint: It's not even close. For the foreseeable future, the great American space race is going to remain with SpaceX as No. 1, then a big gap with everybody else.

The race for No. 2

Investors also need to be aware that Rocket Lab faces some serious competition even in the race to remain No. 2 to SpaceX.

Don't get me wrong. Rocket Lab is accelerating its launch cadence. Its revenue is accelerating. And there's a very real chance Rocket Lab will turn profitable in the next year or two. Still, now that United Launch Alliance has its new Vulcan rocket operational, it's moving quickly to regain its traditional role as one of America's leading launch companies. As I pointed out earlier this month, ULA currently has 23 Vulcan rockets in various stages of construction, and ULA CEO Tory Bruno is promising investors he will launch 20 times next year, and 25 times in 2026.

With 10 launches under its belt already in 2024, and more on the way, Rocket Lab could still out-launch ULA, and remain America's No. 2 launch provider in the future. But ULA is definitely going to try and give Rocket Lab a run for its money.",153,13,https://i.redd.it/h1c1fwpaemkd1.jpeg

FAQ for RKLB For new WSB people (fixed) thanks chatGPT,"**What do they sell?**  
Rockets, satellites, hardware, and software.

**How were they listed?**  
SPAC. They had a peak at $18.

**Who is the CEO?**  
Sir Peter Beck.

**Wait, the CEO is knighted?**  
Yes, he's a New Zealander.

**Wait, the CEO of a significant aerospace company is a New Zealander?**  
Yeah, that's why it's unusual. It shows his intelligence in achieving something no one expected.

**Who are their competitors?**  
SpaceX, Blue Origin, Firefly, Stoke, and technically Astra.

**Wait, I only know two of those.**  
Two have never launched, and two haven't launched for ages.

**Wait, didn't one of those companies also get listed and then delisted?**  
Astra did that, and Virgin Orbit too, until they filed for Chapter 11.

**Ok, cool. What are Rocket Lab's competitive advantages over SpaceX and Blue Origin?**  
With Electron, smaller satellites that need to be launched sooner and to closer locations can be cheaper and more profitable over time compared to delays.

**Wait, why does their revenue recognition change so often over quarters?**  
Revenue for launches can only be recognized at launch, with 90% paid by launch day.

**How many launches are needed on Electron per year to be profitable?**  
Around 21.

**Wait, they didn’t launch that many per year.**  
First, consider revenue recognition. Delays are primarily on the client side.

**What is Neutron?**  
A significant new rocket that can lift up to 13 metric tons.

**How much does R&D for this cost?**  
It's supposed to be around $300 million. It might cost more.

Yes, but relatively speaking, it's cheap. The Falcon 9 cost around $390 million in 2011.

**When will it launch?**  
Mid next year.

**How far along are they in development?**  
They've tested the engine.

**What about their other business activities?**  
Are they doing recovery?  
Soon.

What many people miss about Rocket Lab,"I have seen a lot of posts on here and WSB that only discuss the launch side of Rocket Lab.

Rocket Lab is not just a launch company. They are way more than that. They are an end to end space company.

Take a look at these scenarios below.

Company X( basically all companies that need something in space to operate. Use ASTS for example): These companies design and build something that operates in space, but rely on another company to get their equipment there.

SpaceX: launch provider with an emphasis on launching their own constellation with further goals in space. We all know they can launch themselves.

Rocket Lab: started as a launch only company with Electron but have heavily diversified their business into space systems. Their business offers the ability to design, build, launch and operate a customers satellites or space craft or maybe their own constellation someday. This is why it is called end to end. Their business is not launch, launch is only one of their tools to more effectively do business in space. Neutron will not make or break this company. They do not rely in its success to make them profitable. They could stop development today and still be profitable in the future due to the way they have positioned themselves in the industry through their space system business segments. This type of position is going to be huge in the future as more people move their business into space.

I have followed this company for 3 years and they continue to impress me. Though launch is a very exciting part of this business, since it is really the only one we can see, I encourage every investor here to start viewing this company as an all around space company instead of just a launch company.

Rocket Lab Acquisition / Constellation Analysis,"# Hey r/RKLB, just wanted to share some analysis I've been doing on potential acquisition targets.

Rocket Lab's track record with acquisitions follows a fairly well-defined pattern. Let's take a look at the companies they have purchased thus far:

* **SolAero Technologies** - $80m - Dec '21 - Provider of high performance solar panels - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-space-solar-power-products-company-solaero-holdings-inc/)
* **Planetary System Corp (PSC)** - $42m + 1.7m shares - Dec '21 - Provider of separation systems - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-space-hardware-company-planetary-systems-corporation/)
* **Advanced Solutions Inc (ASI)** - $40m - Oct '21 - Flight software, mission sim, and guidance + nav software - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-acquires-space-software-company-advanced-solutions-inc/)
* **Sinclair Interplanetary** - $ Unknown - Apr - '20 - Satellite components (reaction wheels, star trackers, etc) - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-satellite-hardware-manufacturer-sinclair-interplanetary/)

Here is a section of an interview with CEO Peter Beck explaining the methodology behind Rocket Lab's acquisitions: [https://youtu.be/T\_\_1ubfs\_iE?t=1313](https://youtu.be/T__1ubfs_iE?t=1313)

* ""If the supply chain can not provide us the surety to deliver what we need, then we’ll go and vertically integrate""
* “If it’s too expensive and it’s too slow, generally we need to own it because we can make it cheaper and faster”
* ""Is this going to be strategically important to us in the future for stuff that we think we're going to do""

To summarize, Rocket Lab's acquisitions have all been vertical integration plays; bringing some aspect of their supply chain in house to either reduce lead times, unit cost, or both. Peter has mentioned in multiple interviews that all of these companies have scaled and integrated successfully into Rocket Lab's business.

Note how most of these acquisitions support the production and manufacturing of satellite **buses**. A quick review: satellites can be described as being comprised of a **bus** and a **payload.**

**Bus** - the main structure and infrastructure of a satellite, providing the necessary support systems for the payload to operate effectively. It includes power, structure, solar panels, propulsion, thermal control, attitude control, communication, and on-board computer systems.

**Payload** - the primary instrumentation or equipment on a satellite that performs the specific mission or function, such as sensing, communication, or experimentation, and is the reason the satellite is launched into space.  
  

Rocket Lab can currently produce satellite buses quickly, cost effectively, and at scale. Payloads? Not so much. 

# I think Rocket Lab's next acquisition will be a payload company. A company that specializes communications equipment, imaging/sensors, etc.

It's been clearly communicated by leadership that Rocket Lab plans on building a LEO constellation. If/when they do announce an acquisition of a payload company, we will be able to make some pretty big assumptions about the type of constellation they will build.

I do not think Rocket Lab will build out a direct to consumer mega constellation a la Starlink or Kuiper based on the following:

* Starlink's original estimated cost to design, build and deploy was $10 Billion  [source](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/05/block-5-spacex-increase-launch-cadence-lower-prices/)
* Amazon reportedly invested $10 Billion in the Kuiper project in 2020 [source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/fcc-authorizes-amazon-to-build-kuiper-satellite-internet-network.html)
* Comments from CFO Adam Spice :

>""the broadband from space application that SpaceX targeted with Starlink, that's probably not what we will be going for just given the amount of capital required"" [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=1059)

>""but there's lots of very interesting applications that required dozens or hundreds of satellites not 40 thousand satellites"" [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=1070)

While it's possible they could pursue a smaller 5G constellation similar to AST SpaceMobile, I think AST's tech moat is wide enough that other opportunities make more sense.

# I think it's likely that we see a smaller 100-200 satellite constellation purpose built and marketed towards military applications.

These satellites could provide access to a suite of sensors, communication systems, radar, antennas, etc., and deliver tailored services to DoD customers. A few points supporting that:

* Rocket Lab is prime DoD contractor as of Dec '23, acting as prime for the $515m SDA Tranche 2 Transport Layer - Beta contract. According to Adam Spice this:

>""opens up a lot of opportunities for us"" .. ""we think it's a huge enabler to grow that government exposure"".  [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=515)

* Sitting Board member Nina Armagno, among many other things, **was the first director of staff of the United States Space Force** and was responsible for helping to establish the organizational framework, policies and procedures, building relationships with other branches, etc.  [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/about/team/)
* The business is already heavily focused on gov customers. SDA, ESCAPADE, HASTE, CAPSTONE, TROPICS, etc, all make up a huge chunk of rocket lab's revenue already.

# Ok. So if it's likely that the acquisition is a payload company, and it's likely that the payload would be for a constellation built for servicing DoD customers, I think I know where to look...

# [Here is a list of subcontractors that Rocket Lab selected to help fulfill the SDA contract](https://spaceimpulse.com/2024/05/07/rocket-lab-selects-subcontractors-for-sda-satellite-constellation/#:~:text=The%20selected%20subcontractors%20include%20CesiumAstro,Redwire%20Space%2C%20and%20Parsons%20Corporation)

What do you know, a bunch of **payload** companies (mostly).

* **CesiumAstro** - $260-390m [source](https://app.dealroom.co/companies/cesiumastro) - will provide its Vireo active electronically scanned array (AESA) radio frequency (RF) communications payload, known as the first multi-beam-capable Ka-band communications system for SDA’s PWSA.
* **Mynaric** - $93m Mkt Cap - will supply CONDOR Mk3 optical communication terminals, enhancing free space optical communications for air, space, and mobile applications.
* **Redwire Space** - 450m Mkt Cap - has been chosen for its expertise in antennas and RF hardware.
* **Parsons Corp** - 10b Mkt Cap - will provide the NEBULA Operations – Vendor Architecture (NOVA), serving as Rocket Lab’s ground system for the operational management of its 18 satellites.
* **SEAKR Engineering** - Acquired by Raytheon - will offer its Tactical Satellite Communications (TACSATCOM) Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Network Encryption System (NES).
* **Collins Aerospace** - Acquired by Safran Group -  is set to deliver the waveform necessary for the SDR, essential software and firmware for TACSATCOM’s transmission and reception.

# Cash Situation

Rocket Lab's current Cash and Equivalents and marketable securities etc is $546.8m ([source - slide 37](https://s28.q4cdn.com/737637457/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/FINAL-Rocket-Lab-Q2-2024-Earnings-Presentation.pdf))

All the previous acquisitions have been in the $40-80m range (Sinclair likely less)

Adam Spice gave guidance in the Q2 '24 earnings call that capex for Neutron R&D was expected to tick up in the in the second half of 2024 [source](https://youtu.be/lE9SPN_bIhc?t=3634)

Adam Spice on whether they would do another cap raise - ""Right now we don't see anything that would cause us to go back to capital markets"" but did provide a caveat that for the right opportunity, it's a possibility [source](https://youtu.be/lE9SPN_bIhc?t=5751)

So it's not likely they would raise capital for an acquisition, but it's also not off the table.

Obviously the last three subcontractors on the list aren't an option, and $450m for Redwire seems a bit steep given the cash on hand. **Mynaric** and **CesiumAstro** both fit the profile and around the price range we are looking for.

Do I think one of these companies will be acquired by Rocket Lab? **I don't know**.

Do I think a company *like* Mynaric or CesiumAstro will be acquired by Rocket Lab? **Yes.**

Here's a few predictions:

* I think the first constellation Rocket Lab builds will be less than 200 satellites
* I think it will be purpose built to serve the DoD, possibly partnering with a branch to actually fund the first tranche of satellites
* If there is an acquisition, I feel very confident that it will be a payload company
* Without a cap raise, I think $100m is the most we could afford to spend on an acquisition (assuming no Neutron delays etc)

# TL;DR I don't know if/who they will acquire but wrote this as a framework to (hopefully) start a discussion anchored around the type and size company I think fits the bill.",100,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1evtjur/rocket_lab_acquisition_constellation_analysis/

Some thoughts ,"Hi RKLB family,

I've decided to buy some stock after doing research. I won't be buying a lot due to limited funds (poverty)

Given the recent price jump, likely due to hype and FOMO I plan to wait for a potential dip in the coming days before investing. Hopefully, I won't end up buying at a high price like $10.

I believe in Rocket Lab's potential in the space industry but also want to be cautious about when I enter my position. Honestly, one thing that I realized that it would be wise in the future to hold some stock so when the hype train arrives I could sell some and then buy more after it mellows out.",22,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1euo8d4/some_thoughts/
Everyday Astronaut video about New Glenn,"This post is actually about Rocket Lab & Neutron, not a Blue Origin advertisement.

I really highly recommend watching Everyday Astronaut’s latest YouTube video with Jeff Bezos & New Glenn Factory. It confirmed three things I’ve personally thought are Rocket Labs clear advantages with Neutron.

1. Carbon composite gives you best performance and is clearly the best material choice. Downside to this is iterating the rocket design is not realistic so you have to get it right with the first design. Rocket Lab already did exactly this with Electron.

2. Reusable fairings attached to the 1st stage are an excellent idea to reduce cost.

3. If you can make the 2nd stage cheap enough, you will never have to deal with the problems that a reusable 2nd stage will have. Blue Origin is also attempting this. They’re (in parallel) designing a reusable 2nd stage and another ”as cheap as possible” expendable 2nd stage. Bezos said if they can make the expendable 2nd stage very cheap, then it doesn’t make economical sense to attempt to reuse it. 

What are these 2nd stage problems I mentioned? Look at what Starship has to deal with on re-entry. Combine that with the extra weight of the stainless steel, fuel, heat shielding that is required to make it reusable. That’s weight that could be used to deliver extra payload to orbit. (I know I know, Starship is designed for interplanetary travel etc. so re-entry is a requirement)

Rocket Lab is purely going for a 2nd stage that is as cheap and as light as possible. I think this will prove to be the right choice. There’s a lot of reasons why and are mostly related to economics and performance of the overall vehicle.

For example the empty weight for the 2nd stage of a Falcon 9 is 3900kg. Peter Beck has stated the 2nd stage of Neutron is roughly the same weight as a Harley Davidson motorcycle so around 300-400kg. That’s a big difference.

After watching the video I have a lot more respect for Jeff Bezos & Blue Origin. On a related note, Blue Origin is scheduled to launch two spacecraft built by Rocket Lab to Mars next month (unless there’s a delay)",49,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1eufya5/everyday_astronaut_video_about_new_glenn/
Do you think Starship will leave enough space for RKLB to prosper?,"I've been following spacenews for some years now and decided I would like to invest in RKLB. I agree with probably all of you here that RKLB is the strongest competitor for Nr 2 spot for biggest space company atm. What got me kind of concerned is just how big Starship might get. Do you think that a fully reusable rocket might just take up too many potential orders? It is a huge step from partial reusability to full reusability. Any thoughts?

Edit: Thanks for all the Insight y'all",10,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1eurds2/do_you_think_starship_will_leave_enough_space_for/
Simple DD for Newcomers.,"RKLB builds satellites and rockets currently it has operational Electron small launch rocket with over 50 launches. They are working on a big rocket called Neutron which will be Reusable. As well as a suite of various satellites.

What is a reusable rocket and why is it important?

Most rockets ever to exist have been expendable, meaning they get destroyed or become museum peices. Imagine the cost of an airplane ticket if you had to build a 747 airplane fly across the world and trash the 747 every time. That's basically what humanity did until SpaceX proved it was possible to land rockets with Falcon 9. The concept has been proven. Rocket Lab along with a few others are chasing this dream. Since SpaceX landed Falcon 9 and became reusable no one has been able to duplicate this and the company is now worth 210 billion market cap, they are in first place a huge leap ahead of everyone.

Furthermore, Rocket Lab builds the satellites for many of the launches, satellite components and has a huge space systems division and sells a service, which means they scoop up way more profit margin. They are far ahead all others (excluding SpaceX) and plan to launch the first Neutron mid 2025 and will become profitable shortly after. 

Neutron will be designed to be reusable from day 1 where Falcon 9 was not which will give them a big advantage in design. 

RKLB is only valued around 3.2 billion to SpaceXs 210 billion. Pennies on the dollar and most agree it is wildly undervalued right now. 

So, proof of concept has been established by SpaceX, Rocket Lab has tons of space and launch experience with their Electron Rocket being the second most frequently launched rocket. They have hundreds of millions in cash reserves to finish the development, the Archimedes engine that powers Neutron has just fired up for the first time recently after 3 yesrs of hard work and engines are the longest lead time in building a rocket. No other company is in a more perfect position to become and remain the #2 space company in the world. Once Neutron is successful and launching, this company should easily be worth 20-50 billion dollars ($45-$100 stock price) fair value still a fraction of SpaceX, they will be able to launch their own mega satellite constellations.

The CEO and Founder Peter Beck is an absolute genius, self taught rocket scientist and has been regarded as such by many influential people in the industry.

The meme potential is fun and could be nice, the fundamental potential... the sky is the limit.

Will RKLB's share price double this year? - Re-revisiting my post from 2024/04/29,"Today, on 2024/08/16, RKLB reached $7.10, more than doubling from its YTD low of $3.47 on 2024/04/16. Hell yeah!

  
[My old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cfjtco/will_rklbs_share_price_double_this_year/) from 2024/04/29 follows below:

RKLB share price has a history of doubling from its low during the summer and then falling down to repeat the process next year. So far, it has happened every and each year since its listing on the stock market:

* **2021: $9.5 to $21.34 from 2021/08/27 to 2021/09/09**
* **2022: $3.53 to $7.15 from 2022/06/30 to 2022/08/12**
* **2023:** **$3.76 to $8.05 from 2023/05/09 to 2023/07/19**

The 2024 low has been reached on 2024/4/16 at $3.47. What has changed from previous years besides the company's increased performance is that **the reported short interest YTD has increased by 161% from 22m to 58m shorted shares**. This huge increase right before the summer may cause a bound of a violent volatility once the 2024 doubling commences.

RKLB trades so cheaply and it is so heavily shorted that all that may be needed to revalue its stock is a shift in sentiment. Right now the stock is pricing in the most bearish of bearish outcomes. Delayed Neutron development, increased R&D costs and Electron's obsolescence. But Rocket Lab is the only space company dedicated to being a one stop shop for space applications. Suppose over this year, the management can craft a narrative that Neutron is really coming this year/early next year and with it a significant decrease in R&D costs and the growth and capture of launch and space system markets. Such sentiment shift may take time but I don't know, there are so many unusual factors with Rocket Lab that I could see it happening rapidly.

I am not betting that Rocket Lab is going to stage the most epic growth of all time. I am just betting on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06).
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year.

Peter Beck and Rocket Lab have an opportunity…and seem to be playing it right.,"This isn’t to get too political…it’s about business but also how politics plays an important role in the success of space focused companies.  Everyone here knows that Space X is the current leader in the industry.  They have a solid infrastructure, some good engineers, and have done a great job so far.  They got an early lead and were well on their way to being the leader for decades to come.  Something similar could be said for Tesla.  However, in the early stages in a new industry, big mistakes can be extremely costly.  In the case of Tesla, the focus on the cybertruck and electric semi’s has cost a fair amount of Cap ex and no revenue.  Cybertrucks are sitting on lots and in fields and if you follow the Reddit r/cyberstuck you can see that they are basically hot garbage.  Teslas were incredibly successful at first but the constant price decreases and increases have turned some people off from buying again.  On top of that, and more importantly, Musk himself has alienated his largest consumer base with his anti-California, anti-lgbtq, etc…nonsense.  If there is one thing most successful CEOs will say is keep your loyal customers happy.  Tesla’s share of EV sales has dropped from 75% in 2022 to just under 50% in 2024.  

But, this is about Rocket Lab.  Space companies are going to continue to rely on government contracts along with the private sector.  For U.S. contracts, the company has to be based in the U.S. and meet specific security requirements.  There are only a couple of companies that can do that.  Over the next decade, the space industry should see phenomenal growth.  One company will not provide all the services.  The contracts will be split between multiple companies.  When it comes time to award those contracts, ability and consistency will play a huge role and also reputation.  Beck has done a fantastic job of being politically neutral.  He just gets the job done.  Musk on the other hand has decided to back one horse whole-heartedly and there will be a price to pay for that.  If his candidate loses, along with the trepidation congress already feels about how much power and influence he already has, it could be an opportunity for Rocket Lab to grow with huge contracts.  They just have to get Neutron to be successful.  If Kuniper turns out to have better technology then Starlink and if ASTS technology takes market share since a lot of people just want their phone to work in remote areas and not carry around an entire dish, then that could slow Starlink growth.  Space X will continue to be successful due to Starship but they are not guaranteed the top spot forever now.

Post-Neutron profitability ,"Given that Space X and Blue Origin either have or are developing larger rockets than Neutron, I wonder if Rocket Lab will need to start developing a larger rocket than Neutron in order to compete.

Rocket Lab Stock Soars. Space Has Momentum.

Commercial space company Rocket Lab RKLB 12.58% posted stronger quarterly sales Thursday evening, sending shares soaring. Rocket Lab, like Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has space launch and satellite-building capabilities. SpaceX, of course, is dominant, launching almost 80 times so far in 2024. Rocket Lab has launched nine times. Investors don’t get regular quarterly updates from Musk’s privately held space company. That isn’t the case with publicly traded Rocket Lab. For the second quarter, Rocket Lab reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, of negative $21 million from sales of just over $106 million. Wall Street was looking for an Ebitda loss of $26 million from sales of just under $106 million. Better cost control, resulting in a smaller-than-expected loss, is a positive. So are higher sales. Rocket Lab’s second-quarter sales grew about 15% compared with the first quarter and more than 70% year over year. The results sent Rocket Lab shares up about 12.6% in Friday trading to $5.37 apiece. The S&P 500 SPX 0.47% and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA 0.13% gained 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively. Following the report, Stifel analyst Erik Rasmussen wrote that launch demand remains strong and that sales should jump higher in the fourth quarter following relatively flat third-quarter sales of between $100 and $105 million. Rasmussen projects $121 million in fourth-quarter sales, up more than 100% year over year. He projects 2025 sales of about $576 million, up 36% from expected 2024 sales. Rasmussen projects positive Ebitda for the company in 2026, after sales hit almost $1 billion. He rates Rocket Lab shares Buy and has a $9 price target for the stock. Through Friday trading, Rocket Lab shares were down about 4% year to date.Shares of space start-up Virgin Galactic SPCE 2.16% are down about 87% this year, despite a 14% jump on Thursday. The company reported second-quarter sales of $4.2 million on Wednesday evening. Wall Street was looking for $3.4 million. Galactic focuses, of course, on space tourism. While better-than-expected sales are positive, ramping up capacity has been harder than the company expected. Rocket Lab has had more success providing launch services for companies looking to deploy small satellites into low-earth orbit. Coming into Friday trading, Galactic’s market capitalization was below $200 million. Rocket Lab’s was north of $2.3 billion. SpaceX dwarfs them both. It’s valued at some $200 billion in private markets.

_____________________________________________________

Rocket Lab had another successful launch this morning.   Just watched them successfully deploy the Capella satellite.  I think we see $10 by the end of the year.  I also think there might be more consolidation in the space industry.  Everyone knows that to compete with Musk you have to grow as fast as possible.  I wouldn’t be surprised to see more U.S. government contracts announced for Rocket Lab.  Boeing has really dropped the ball with leaving the astronauts stuck in space.  They are not getting any contracts until they bring them home unless one of their paid servants in congress really pushes for more money for Boeing.  If two of the big companies don’t combine in the next 12 months I’ll be surprised.  ",99,48,https://i.redd.it/rgqb4oh2o1id1.jpeg

"Manifest Space interview with Andy Lapsa, Stoke Space CEO (2024-07-25)","As another up and coming potential competitor to Rocket Lab, I thought people might find this interview from a couple of weeks ago worth listening to:

https://open.spotify.com/episode/3IpviNvEIcPEIQr6mrFIoB?si=IDhsKoiHR8mzJ0HN1i7r_Q

Given Stoke are aiming to be a launch only company at this point, I don't think the threat from these guys is too much at this point in time, although Andy did make a comment in the interview that I took as a bit of a sign that they're aiming to progress beyond launch, once they've got launch itself nailed down.

For those who don't know, Stoke are the company aiming to create a fully and rapidly reusable medium lift rocket (on the lower side of medium lift) called Nova. That might sound unlikely for a startup to achieve, but I've got a huge amount of respect for this company and the founders already.

First of all because they just sound like they know what they're doing, but also and probably more importantly because:

- They've already built and started testing a full flow staged combustion cycle engine in just a couple of years since first funding (an insane achievement)
- They've got an actual (and innovative) plan for how to make their second stage reusable, with a novel engine and actively cooled heatshield design
- On top of that they've also been testing development hardware already (doing hop tests) for that second stage

They are privately funded, not a public company to invest in, but I definitely think they're one to keep an eye on, if for no other reason than to keep an eye on as a Rocket Lab competitor (though they seem to be doing an awesome enough job that I'm just interested in seeing what they do anyway).

They aim for first launch at the end of 2025, so around the same time as Neutron.",34,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1ep33m5/manifest_space_interview_with_andy_lapsa_stoke/
First time RKLB has ever reported a net increase in Current Assets,"I'm sure a good amount of you caught this, but in all the excitement around record revenue/growth, the successful hot fire, the neutron infrastructure updates, etc, I missed something.

As far as I'm aware Rocket lab has never posted a quarterly net increase in total current assets **(obviously not counting the capital raise in February).**

Except they did last quarter. This really surprised me, I expected to see a similar quarter over quarter decrease typical to any quarter since the SPAC merger.

Total current assets as well as cash & equivalents + marketable securities combined are slightly higher this quarter than last.

Is this the start of a trend? I'm skeptical for now. CFO Adam Spice mentioned an increase in capex through the next 3-4 quarters tapering off in Q2 '25 as the first neutron launch approaches. That mixed with the lower expected launch revenue in Q3, I wouldn't be too surprised to see the downtrend resume, at least in the near term.

I still found this encouraging and thought it was worth a share.

New Partnership Announced: They just teamed up with a major player in the industry, which could significantly boost their market reach and revenue.
Innovative Product Launch: The latest product they’ve been working on is set to disrupt the market, and early reviews are extremely positive.
Strong Financials: Last quarter's earnings report showed impressive growth, with projections looking even better.
Insider Buying: Some key executives have been buying shares, which could be a strong signal of confidence in the company's future.

Best EC day!,"Been holding shares for a few years now. Such a fan of $RKLB, and today did not disappoint. Peter Beck keeps his cards close to the vest for sure. There were so many rumors and theories about the got fire burn being some sort of explosion. They weren't all wrong, it was beautiful burn at 102%.
The earnings PDF was so well put together this quarter. I think it was the best presented and informed one to date as far as organized information and stats. 
I saw a lot of posts this morning on the $RKLB Yahoo thread. One person posted that they're done with this company becuuse ""they can't win,"" as the stock was climbing today!
More shates for the rest of us I suppose. Excited for Neutron next year, excited for the future for this company.

"From Their Sub, 5 Months Ago","I am NOT recommending ASTS (no bad blood, just not interested in any space stock other than RKLB), but read this post from 5 months ago, when the stock was $3. Do you see the similarities between this and the bulls on this sub? 

My point is not that we will 6x from here, nor that we are guaranteed to succeed. I am also not dismissing the fact that most hyper-growth companies that failed had investors saying such things. 

However, in all the FOMO we keep experiencing, I just want everyone to remember that ASTS bulls suffered for years before seeing these monstrous gains. Yet, even in the steady bleeding, they maintained the thesis and profited greatly.

My point is this: if you find yourself genuinely convinced that the market will, as with ASTS, “not only price in current potential, but also expected future potential,” then do not lose heart. ",20,17,https://i.redd.it/lofaao1x7jgd1.jpeg

Possible hot fire at NASA Stennis - analysis with NASA firms data.,"Firms (=Fire Information Resource Management System) uses satellites to determine potential wild fire locations. They do that by detecting abnormal heat signatures. It is near real time - about 3 hours delayed.

And the location of a fire at Stennis could not be more precise, it was right at the RocketLabs Stennis test stand. There was a fire detected on the 18th of July. Check out the link below. 

[https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/#d:2024-07-16..2024-07-31;@-89.59,30.36,14.00z](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/#d:2024-07-16..2024-07-31;@-89.59,30.36,14.00z)",48,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1egwxf4/possible_hot_fire_at_nasa_stennis_analysis_with/

The SPAC = bad argument...,"Some people argue that all SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) are bad or risky investments.  
  
While they have a point, they're missing the bigger picture. SPACs offer an easy way for companies to access public markets quickly and with less scrutiny. Naturally, this path attracts some questionable companies. However, what these critics overlook is that there are solid companies that have gone public via SPACs because it was a general trend, not because they are shady.

An interesting point to note is that the median return of the entire stock market is negative, with almost every sector, from healthcare to energy, following this trend (with the exception of finance, which has a neutral median return). Only a few stocks contribute to an overall positive average return. (Source: [https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/average-is-not-the-same-as-median](https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/average-is-not-the-same-as-median))

Therefore, SPACs failing or delivering negative returns isn't extraordinary; it's the norm.   
  
Most SPACs are in a worse position than when they went public, often having attempted and failed to launch their projects since their listing. 

However, this isn't the case with RocketLab.   
When RocketLab went public via a SPAC in August 2021, they had already launched 21 times in 4 years, had an annual revenue of $60 million, and their space systems side was just getting started. Now, they launch over 15 times per year, aim for over $400 million in annual revenue, secure constellation-level contracts and $0.5 billion satellite contracts, and we can see their Neutron hardware taking shape.

-> RocketLab is in a significantly better position than when they were listed. The share price does not show it, but the company got fundamentally better.

This is not financial advice, just a few thoughts I had when I saw a graphic about median stock returns.

Whitepaper for the reaction wheel manufacturing line,"Some interesting parts illuminating how RocketLab is saving manufacturing costs.

-""Multiple automated stations are used to burn in the electronics, assemble the rotors, wind the stators, and test the final assembled product""

-"" The reaction wheel has been designed with injection moulded parts""

- ""An automated piece of equipment has been developed which **undertakes a measurement of unbalance**, calculates the required material removal at discrete intervals, **and undertakes this removal**. The process can be iterated as required to achieve the required unbalance specification.""

With 100 reaction wheels per size per decade (Sinclair delivered a total of 360 reaction wheels to orbit before they got the big contract), you do not design and order an injection mold- you just CNC it because its cheaper.  
And you do not built a machine to automatically balance the rotors.

"Implied Volatility (IV) Skew for RKLB, unified for three approaching option expiration dates: August 2, August 9, and August 16","**Implied Volatility (IV):** IV is a measure of the market's forecast of a likely movement in a security's price. It often rises in bearish markets and falls in bullish markets, as higher IV corresponds to higher expected risk or uncertainty.

**IV Skew:** This shows the difference in IV across different strike prices for option contracts. Different IVs for different strikes reflects the market's expectations of the likelihood of different outcomes.

This skew is showing that the market is *positioning* and *hedging* for a large potential move up OR down within the coming weeks.

To be clear, this is to be taken with a grain of salt, the option chain is just one of many data inputs that investors should consider. But for what its worth, alongside the IV skew, **open interest** and **put/call volume** on the option chain are also quite bullish.

How to accelerate Rocket Lab's growth,"Rocket Lab has correctly positioned itself as a vertically-integrated player in the rapidly growing New Space economy. From components to systems, spacecraft, constellations, and through to launch, on-orbit operations, and space-based application solutions, Rocket Lab has built up the capability to “do what it says it’s going to do.” More importantly, as it has built up these capabilities, it’s done so with a success rate that approaches 100%. Rocket Lab does not fail, or at least hasn’t failed so far. As Beck is heard to say in Wild Wild Space, ""I’m not built to build shit.”

Yet there are tradeoffs to be made between organic growth and growth gained through acquisitions. Yes, building up capabilities in-house at a place like Rocket Lab ensures that the results meet and often exceed immediate and long-term requirements. Whereas the challenges of an acquisition include cultural fit and other integration challenges as well as inevitable product evolution to meet internal requirements. The biggest expense of internal development is the opportunity cost. Though an acquisition costs actual cash, you’re buying a capability that’s closer to market already.

While Rocket Lab has **capabilities**, it has limited **capacity**. The New Space economy is growing so fast that Rocket Lab doesn’t have enough time to hire the number of top-flight team members needed to grow their business from the inside. But the company’s anemic market cap makes it nearly impossible to acquire top-flight technologies to keep up with requirements, opportunities, and capacity.

As I see it, there are 4 possible scenarios that will allow the company to optimize growth and fully realize its potential:

1. The market must respond to Rocket Lab’s potential to such an extent that the market cap grows by multiples.
2. An outside equity investor must be found to invest $1 billion or more to fund acquisitions, but diluting existing investors in the process.
3. Rocket Lab must merge or even be acquired by another company with compatible capabilities/capacity and access to significant capital.
4. Rocket Lab can continue to grow organically with the opportunities and challenges it currently faces.

The market may give greater recognition to Rocket Lab once Neutron reaches orbit. But the stated scale up of launch cadence is incremental, spanning several years before it can deploy a constellation like the Falcon 9 is doing for StarLink. Even with a 70% annual growth rate, it’ll take many years to reach the scale implied by Peter Beck’s vision.
