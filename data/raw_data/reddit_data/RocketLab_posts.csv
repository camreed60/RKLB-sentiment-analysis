These both have a ways to go before being realized and I have a hard time believing that Blue Origin can meet that price target but one thing they can do is subsidize the cost via Bezos and drive out most of the competition.

Moat chat,"First off this ain't a DD. This is a motivational wake up to what is actually happening. 


Every month that rocketlab is running, is the moat.


This ain't a 7/11 franchise. This is a business that has all the knowledge and engineering to get to space. Every day, every week, every month something new is learned that gives them an edged. All the layers beyond just a rocket, rocketlab already is refining and gaining new plans and partnerships.


All their previous launches, all that experience, gaining customers, a proven track record, refining, adapting, tweaking, integrating. Rocketlab building parts, building platforms, launching, monitoring, landing, building a process, refining a process.


The amount of experience, retaining customers, providing new experiences and solutions for customers...


...that is the moat. Doing the hard thing, doing it well, and most importantly already doing it. There isn't hopium, there isn't promises, they are already doing it.


Others haven't even scratched the surface of what that all entails. They don't have all the additional staff, processes, customers, solutions, platforms, they are stuck on figuring out step one. They are blowing millions, billions, without even a foundation of a business yet.


Rocketlab is so far ahead that they have a wild tech/intelligence/platform moat that is still far unrealized compared to their stock worth.


I am actually incredibly excited because a lot of this is still to be discovered by others. You really need to grasp how much rocketlab has already accomplished and how fast they are moving on neutron and space systems. Like, this ain't a shop that sells loaves of bread(nothing against a good sour dough, promise). They made a business that escapes the atmosphere, literally leaving the planet to find new opportunities. That is something once only held by the wealthiest and most knowledgable countries. Now we have it from rocketlab, where we individually have the ability, through its stock, to be a part of it. Literally nerd heaven.


Owning some rocketlab stock puts us right there in time, in the history of humanity where we are transitioning to space. Like imagine what you can tell your kids, nephews and neices or grand kids.


The wonderful thing is, you don't even have to imagine, you just do it, and you are a part of all this. Own a piece of this awesomeness. Help make sure it all happens, promote it, champion it. 


I just don't even know what else to say!!! It's so damn exciting.

Let's just imagine... what happens to Rocket Lab post-contact from Aliens?,"I know it is a taboo subject with a million different theories or beliefs. With all the congress hearings lately claiming UAPs are real, they are here, they hypothesize how they work within our understanding of physics but all agree the technology is not ours.

Let's just play pretend and all of that is 100% real and all of a sudden some alien race made contact and we got access to their gravitational propulsion technology, and are able to travel between our atmosphere, space, other planets, etc all very fast.

Does Rocket Lab just immediately become obsolete and tank? I suppose even if we don't need launch vehicles like rockets, the satellite components business would still be in full operation and working.

Or maybe it is a massive catalyst in humanity's drive for space and motivation to become interplanetary. All of a sudden rocket launches and satellites are #1, 2 and 3 priority and get massive attention and funding.

I thought this would be a fun thought experiment and conversation if we all think outside the box and think open minded!

Where's the hop test vehicle?,"I am new to reddit but not new to NewSpace. I realize this is my first post and thus anticipate some downvotes.

I have a lingering thought. For Neutron reusability, where is the hop test vehicle? And if it is partially built, why has Rocket Lab not shared it's progress? Electron's 1st stage ability to come back to an area above the ocean via parachutes, to then be caught by a helicopter, was an interesting idea that never materialized. Bringing Neutron back to the Wallops pad, at a precise location, is much more challenging. And doing that landing on a floating barge is much more difficult. Why no word on the barge build?

Will rocket lab make weapons?,"So normally I don't care that much about morals generally and I am aware that companies like lockheed martin don't give a flying sh\* wether I buy a stock or not. Humans get bombed (or not bombed) regardless wether peasants like me buy a stock. I understand that it makes no difference, but still I don't think its moral to invest in stocks that build weapons. So I wanted to buy rocket lab stocks and I am wondering are they planning to make weapons in the near future? Or will they stick to peaceful space stuff?

Edit: With weapons I am specifically referring to bombs or other devices designed to activly hurt or kill people. I am not talking about missiles in general. Also I don't care about it if the rockets accidently crash and hurt the environment. The earth will certainly carry on without us. However I think its immoral to take away life, as in killing humans. Therefor (and thats just personal, not judging investors) I don't want to invest in stocks that build weapons (specifically bombs or WoMD designed to kill humans). Excluding explosives that are not used to harm humans (nuking an asteroid flying towards earth or exploding a mountain to mine diamonds). I just don't want my invested money used to actively hurt other people. However I don't care about espionage, cars and engines that hurts the environment or climate change or something like that. As I said my morals are not high. Its just that I draw the line at bombing people. I know its irrational, but thats just how I think. I do not care about companies like TikTok collecting our data (cause honestly its your deserved punishment for consuming so much brainrot content)",0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1fks5jh/will_rocket_lab_make_weapons/

Any chance for consideration?  Rejected due to short jobs(Aviation background).,"I had applied for Vehicle Integration and got scheduled for a phone interview.  When the date/time came, I didn't receive a call but about an hour later got a message that RocketLab decided to go with NZ/Aus residents for the position.  Yesterday, I get a email about another job I had applied for(Reaction Wheel) that got filled and was telling me to basically reapply.  I see that Vehicle Integration is still up there so I inquired on whether I should reapply for that too.  The response I got was most of my recent jobs were too short and the team decided to move on.

I never got a chance to interview to explain that those were contract jobs in the aviation field.  They said they were looking for people that had +3yrs at one place but the last 7 years I just worked in aviation(though worked at Sierra Space and Huntington-Ingalls in that time span too), I think most I spent at one place was 2 years but we ended up getting laid off a lot when the job was done.

I hope what I'm thinking doesn't happen,"I have a theory about why Blue Origin might finally cancel the launch of the Rocket Lab probes.

It was recently revealed that Blue Origin had applied for a license from the FAA to ship the Blue Moon MK1 in March 2025. (https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueOrigin/comments/1eqf17f/blue\_moon\_mk1\_pathfinder\_net\_march\_2025/)

A few days ago Bloomberg revealed that the hardware of the second and third New Glenn ship had been damaged in internal company tests, if the report is accurate, BO only has a single New Glenn ship tested and ready to fly, with the urgency of BO to demonstrate their lunar rover for missions to NASA while Starship is in development, they may have their internal interests as priority. (https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/08/21/bezos-blue-origin-suffers-fiery-setback-building-new-rocket/)

Let us remember that the probes that Rocket Lab has manufactured are launch class D, low-cost and these can be delayed, since they are not an urgent priority like classes A and B would be.

These are my thoughts, maybe I'm wrong and everything is ready for launch, but if Blue Origin decides in the end that they will not be able to meet the schedule for the window, it is possible that they are considering this path of prioritizing their lunar module since they are very profitable missions that NASA spends a lot of money

Downward revision for Q2 launches?,"Hey everyone.

Ahead of earnings I've been doing some research. I'm fairly ok with this quarter earnings meeting the targets of 98m assuming the space system forecast was accurate. Traditionally they've been pretty close so maybe +/- 1m but overall they've had all successful launches done.

My issue is for the upcoming quarter. Didn't they guide for like 6 launches this quarter? And more so for the entire year it was around 22/24. I really don't think this seems feasible right now. 

A possible downwards revision in launches in the guidance could be bearish news for this stock right? We could take a big hit that basis?

A delay/downwards revision in launches is either due to the fault of customers not having satellites ready to go or just a big lag between when Rocket lab get the electron rockets ready for launch.

The other side is the good news which could be them saying they'd be able to hit the target launches and possible news of neutron.",8,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1chca1w/downward_revision_for_q2_launches/

A Rocket Lab Name Change?,"Sure, Rocket Lab launches rockets, but the majority of its business (read: revenue, profits, contracts, attentions) is in space systems. As the business tilts further away from rockets, everybody from Peter Beck on down is talking about how the company's current name might be a bit misleading.

Should the name of the company be changed? If so, what are the considerations you would try to balance in a rebranding effort? For a company like Rocket Lab, which is increasingly pivoting to emphasize its space systems operations while still retaining its roots in rocket technology, what are some suggested names that strike the proper balance?",0,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1cg8lnp/a_rocket_lab_name_change/

Does Rocket Lab have a future with its space rockets?,"Many startups have emerged in this new boom in space exploration in the US, I think we are clear about who is the most influential in terms of rocket construction, SpaceX, Rocket Lab and Blue Origin.

But there is also a group of startups that are not interested in building rockets, because they are clear that they cannot compete with the main 3, so they are dedicating their efforts to trying to offer other services related to payload, saleslites, software, among others. . services that may arise, but we will not talk about them, we will focus on SpaceX, Blue Origin and Rocket Lab, which is what is expected of them in the coming years and this is where I want to make it clear that it is my perception that I will say to below and this may not happen as I will say.

To begin with, I think that SpaceX and Blue Origin have some points in common, not only does it have a strong backing of money, but its CEOs are people with certain power, who may have certain ties with politicians, this in some way . may influence certain future government contracts.

As for Rocket Lab, it is a company that comes from nowhere and is making its way with its own resources, this is where I want to remain skeptical, I don't know if Rocket is aware that it can be very difficult to compete directly with these 2 companies in the future, maybe I'm wrong, but I have the feeling that Rocket Lab will eventually focus on offering services like the other startups they mention at the beginning want to do and will slowly abandon rockets.

I want an Electron Launch using 3D / Spacial cameras,If you are reading this Rocket Lab tech employees and want to get a bunch of people excited to watch a launch (I watch them anyway since they are fun) put some live feed 3D / Spatial cameras on the pad or set up one to record a launch and then allow viewing of it.

It just irks me that as Beck is doing what needs to be done to be successful, the CEO of their biggest competitor met with a presidential candidate today who is asking for money.  You know if that happens there will be an understanding that SpaceX gets even more preferential treatment than anyone else.

Neutron‚Äôs Use of Carbon Fiber,"Can someone help me understand why carbon fiber is being used for Neutron and not Starship? Why is it more cost-effective for SpaceX to use stainless steel, but Rocket Lab determined carbon fiber would be more cost-effective for Neutron? 

In terms of durability, will carbon fiber still allow neutron to be reused a high number of times? I‚Äôm especially curious about reusability because of Rocket Lab‚Äôs goal of eventually having the capability to relaunch within 24 hours. 

Is it also possible Rocket Lab is becoming increasingly better equipped to manufacture carbon fiber materials, and they‚Äôre capitalizing on this more than SpaceX?",30,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1b8721b/neutrons_use_of_carbon_fiber/
Estimating Neutron first launch date based on publicly announced milestones,"Reposting with some updates to assumptions, from a different account for privacy reasons. Calculations haven't changed, and reference data is shown in the table at the bottom.

A little out of interest and mostly out of boredom, I decided to collate some public statements around Neutron development milestones to estimate the delay to Neutron's first launch date. For this, I collected statements from:

* Presentations available on Rocket Lab's investor relations page
* Archived versions of the Neutron page on the Rocket Lab website

This work could be expanded significantly by trawling through videos, interviews, etc as well (but not by me, this was already only mildly less boring than what I was avoiding doing). It is only a very simple analysis, with some large assumptions being made. Of course, these are only adjustments to public timelines and contain no inside knowledge of Rocket Lab's schedules or internal estimates.

Here's a chart of the results up front:

[Chart of Neutron first launch date estimates. The x-axis is the date that the statement of a milestone was made \(either Archimedes first hot fire or LC-3 readiness\).](https://preview.redd.it/gx0p4rpf4mmc1.png?width=3126&format=png&auto=webp&s=f13b2973239623152232b2c6b00da92ff294b353)

There are two different estimates based on two different approaches for each public statement date:

1. Simple Delay - assumes the amount of work after the milestone date remains the same as the original schedule, and adds the delay to the original launch date of 31 Dec 2024. This means that if Archimedes first hot fire is delayed by one year, the first launch date is delayed by one year.
2. Proportional Delay - this assumes that the effort estimates for the whole schedule are off by some factor, and applies that factor to the remaining activities as well. I.e., if it takes twice as long to reach Archimedes first hot fire from project start, it will also take twice as long to reach first launch from project start.

There are obviously a fair few assumptions going into this very basic analysis:

* Archimedes and LC-3 readiness are on the critical path to first launch. This means any delay to either of these is a delay to first launch. None of the calculated dates above assume a delay in both, only one or the other (and all but one is based on a delay in Archimedes).
* It does not account for any ""accelerations"" such as the company throwing significantly more people or money at the program, purchasing more components rather than building in house, etc. It also assumes that any planned ramp up in personnel is included in the original timeline and any other timelines shared publicly by the company.
* It assumes publicly announced dates were the best dates known to the company at the time, and takes them at face value on this.
* These two models for estimating delay are valid.
* When milestones were only listed as being completed in ""Q3"", the latest date in that quarter or month was assumed.
* When milestones were listed on the timeline on the Neutron page (only sorted by year, but in order), best guess was applied for delivery date to try and be most reasonable.
* It includes all delays - including from changing Archimedes architecture and having to redo a bunch of work there.

**What does this tell us?**

Neutron is probably delayed based on the assumptions made here, without a significant change in approach or spend - this analysis estimates to 2026 in all likelihood. This isn't a validated approach to estimating first launch of a new rocket, so you could dismiss it entirely if you want.

I personally think the first launch will be somewhere in between the Simple Delay and Proportional Delay (a bit closer to the Simple Delay) as the company will be trying to accelerate as much as they can to recover the timeline, and the Proportional Delay estimates are therefore extremely conservative. But at this scale, it only takes a few simple mistakes to significantly delay a program, so who knows.

**If you wanted to take this further**

I would recommend two next steps:

1. Add in more information sources (interviews, podcasts, videos, info from Electron launch livestreams, etc)
2. Perform the same analysis for other companies' first rockets that have actually launched to roughly assess the validity or accuracy of the method

Tl;dr - just look at the pretty graph

Can anyone shed any light on whether my concerns are real or if they're planning building more Neutron rockets from the get go?",251,49,https://i.redd.it/c0l3c97tiplc1.jpeg

Space Services,"Peter Beck pointed out in this last earnings call that ultimately the greatest TAM, and therefore revenue, will be space services. The big question is which service segment will solidify Rocket Lab‚Äôs future. In a lot of ways, I like that Beck very deliberately left it open. It‚Äôs entirely possible the most revolutionary space service has yet to be realized, and Rocket Lab will be positioned to take full advantage of the opportunity by the time it comes into sight. Any ideas what space services will evolve with the same explosive growth that a lot of information technology did over the past 20 years? 

We‚Äôre constantly reminded that ‚Äúspace is hard,‚Äù so I can appreciate that these things take time, but I really want to be able to envision what the next 20+ years looks like for space services specifically. ",35,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1b1s02u/space_services/

Has anyone else been getting emails from ""Rocket Lab"" saying they have positions open and would like to conduct an interview with me. It seems fine at first but the more I look at the paperwork and such I am pretty sure it is a scam that someone is doing. So if someone see's it be careful I doubt that it is the real company. I can attach a screengrab of the email I have got a few times now. Then once you answer the email like an automated one sends again saying to contact them through teams and to continue with the interview through there. I am pretty positive this is a scam but I haven't talked with them other than sending the first email.

"LC-1A vs LC1-B, choice of launch pad in New Zealand","RocketLab's first 23 Electron launches were from LC-1A in New Zealand.

In 2022 they finished construction of a new pad, LC-1B, near the original and intended to increase launch frequency. 

The next 15 New Zealand launches in a row were from LC-1B. (And some from a third launchpad in America). 

Why is there such a strong preference for LC-1B? Is it better than LC-1A in some way? Is LC-1A undergoing upgrades currently? LC-1B was built five years later so might be a better pad and they've gone back to make the same changes to LC-1A?    
Or is the plan to ignore LC-1A and stick to LC-1B, improve launch frequency with a better pad rather than improving frequency by using two pads? I did wonder if they were modifying the pad ready for Neutron but that's a much larger rocket so they'd probably need to build a whole new pad rather than upgrading the oldest one.

So what's happening with LC-1A? Is LC-1B just better?",17,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1axcf1c/lc1a_vs_lc1b_choice_of_launch_pad_in_new_zealand/

Is Rocket Lab moving away from Matlab and towards Python in all jobs?,"Hi guys,

&#x200B;

I am thinking of going to uni this year and doing some ad-hoc courses in Python and data analysis to better prepare myself for some mechanical engineering roles in Rocket Lab. On many job listings, Python seems to be the sole requirement as far as data analysis goes.

&#x200B;

Does this indicate that Rocket Lab no longer is favouring Matlab and that I don't have to worry about taking Matlab courses to prepare myself better for some roles, such as in propulsion or thermofluids? Getting into one of these would be a dream!

Thanks in advance for all answers!

Cheers :)",30,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1aubbji/is_rocket_lab_moving_away_from_matlab_and_towards/

Sources indicate that the customer is likely the Space Development Agency.," 

SDA, an organization under the U.S. Space Force, is building a mesh[ network of military satellites](https://spacenews.com/space-development-agency-renames-constellation-to-reflect-focus-on-u-s-warfighter/?preview_id=140632&preview_nonce=0118ef1bb4&preview=true&_thumbnail_id=141872) in low Earth orbit known as the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.

SDA Director Derek Tournear speaking at a conference earlier this month said the agency was negotiating a contract with an unspecified supplier for 18 satellites to expand the U.S. military low Earth orbit constellation.

One of the portions of SDA‚Äôs proliferated architecture is the [Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta](https://spacenews.com/space-development-agencys-data-transport-satellites-get-more-complex/), made up of communications satellites to enable beyond line-of-sight connectivity for military forces on the ground.¬†

Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta is projected to have 90 satellites. The agency in August announced it awarded $1.5 billion in contracts to Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman for 72 Beta satellites.

Tournear said Dec. 7 at a National Security Space Association event that SDA was planning to add another 18 Beta satellites to the constellation and was in negotiations with another vendor that he did not disclose.

The Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta satellites ‚Äî projected to launch in 2026 and 2027 ‚Äî will carry radios using the UHF (Ultra High Frequency) and S-band frequencies that military and intelligence units rely upon for voice and low-speed data transmissions.

‚ÄúWe are looking at putting another approximately 18 satellites on contract, and we‚Äôre working with a third vendor to do that, and we should make that announcement shortly,‚Äù Tournear said Dec. 7 at the NSSA forum.¬†

According to Rocket Lab‚Äôs SEC filing, the contract includes a base amount of $489 million, with incentives and options worth $26 million. ‚ÄúWork under the agreement will begin immediately with the delivery of the space vehicles to the customer for launch slated for 2027, operation of the satellites through 2030, and an option to operate the satellites through 2033.‚Äù

Why is RocketLab the only launch provider with a Photon equivalent?,"Photon is a really cool addition to RocketLab's Electron rocket.

It blurs the lines between being a part of the payload and part of the launch vehicle, in a way it's both at once. From the customer's perspective it must be really useful to have Photon as an option when launching your payload. It can provide extra thrust to reach higher orbits than Electron alone, or it can provide the orbit circularisation burn at apogee, in both cases removing the need for the payload to handle those burns and keeping the final payload mass low. But it's also a communications bus to talk to Earth, has precision guidance systems and star tracking to assist in those final burns, further reducing payload complexity.

I was looking up Photon to make this post and I discovered they've made it even better than I already thought it was. The CAPSTONE mission to the moon last year used an upgraded Photon with an upgraded engine. They're marketing it as a full satellite bus with solar panels and radio antennae for missions to Mars or Venus. I thought it was just the kick-stage for the last little nudge to the correct orbit, I didn't realise it was so capable.

Which feeds more into my question, why doesn't anyone else have a Photon equivalent?

RocketLab's website describes Photon as being ""Vertically integrated with in-house subsystems based on constellation-scale manufacturing capabilities"". Yeah, it's made by people who routinely make and launch rockets, uses known parts and subsystems with known behaviours and capabilities. It just makes sense that the rocket manufacturer can make a really effective satellite bus, especially for customers where this might be their first satellite. I wonder if the customer base of smallsat providers / first launches is why this is relevant for RocketLab but not SpaceX. In theory SpaceX make a bigger and better kickstage/satellite-bus with Draco/Superdraco engines and help people launch more capable satellites. But Falcon 9 is so much bigger that their customers are usually larger and more capable of managing their own payloads. Electron is so much smaller and more of their customers are smallsats / first ever launches and they need to lean more heavily on the launch provider.

It may also be that Falcon 9's second stage has excess capacity compared to Electron's second stage. Apart from Starlink launches very few Falcon 9 launches come within 20% of the max payload capacity so they just use the second stage for circularisation burns or finessing the orbital insertion. Electron can't do that because it's so close to the mass limits and it's more efficient to ditch the second stage mass and use a smaller kickstage for circularisation burns.

But I'm just guessing blind really. I'd like to see SpaceX develop a Photon equivalent for Falcon 9. Or someone else, maybe Stoke or Relativity Space or ISRO.",36,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/176zsgg/why_is_rocketlab_the_only_launch_provider_with_a/

**Reused Rutherford Engine Successfully Flies on 40th Mission!** 

You   read that right! On August 24 (NZST), we successfully launched our  40th  Electron mission, called ‚ÄúWe Love the Nightlife,‚Äù for Capella  Space.  Not only did we deliver Capella‚Äôs satellite to orbit, but we  also  demonstrated some significant milestones in evolving Electron into  a  reusable rocket.¬†

For  the  first time, we reused a Rutherford engine that had previously flown  on  our ‚ÄúThere And Back Again‚Äù mission in May 2022. The engine worked   flawlessly on its second flight as it took Electron to space. Then the   first stage returned to Earth with a successful ocean splashdown in the   Pacific Ocean.¬†

Hot on the heels  of ‚ÄúWe Love the Nightlife,‚Äù we‚Äôre launching another  dedicated Electron  launch for Capella. The ‚ÄòWe Will Never Desert You‚Äô  mission is scheduled  for lift-off from Launch Complex 1 as soon as 19  September. The  mission will be our third launch for Capella this year ‚Äì  we're on a  roll! ¬†

* [Four new HASTE missions](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=dd817b0cc7&e=56a66a2a9a) for Leidos under the MACH-TB program, scheduled to launch from LC-2 across 2024 and 2025. ¬†
* BlackSky,   a leading provider of real-time geospatial intelligence and global   monitoring services, which has launched on six Electron missions since   2019, [signed a block buy deal for five Electron launches](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=85cc888a2e&e=56a66a2a9a)   for their Gen-3 satellites beginning in 2024. Fun fact: BlackSky has   used Electron as a launch vehicle more than any other single commercial   customer!¬†¬†
* A new, double-launch deal with NASA to deliver their climate change research-focused mission, [PREFIRE](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=45378f0d66&e=56a66a2a9a),   is now scheduled to launch in May 2024. NASA's PREFIRE (Polar Radiant   Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment) mission will help close a gap in   understanding of how much of Earth‚Äôs heat is lost to space, especially   from the Arctic and Antarctica. This will be our 7th and 8th mission  for  NASA since 2018. (Graphic we made of 2 launches)¬†¬†
* Last but not least, [we signed a deal with Japanese Earth imaging company Synspective ](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=8e1595f672&e=56a66a2a9a)to   launch two dedicated Electron missions. Rocket Lab has been launching   for Synspective since 2020 when the Company deployed the first  satellite  in Synspective‚Äôs synthetic aperture radar (SAR)  constellation. Since  that first mission, Rocket Lab has been the sole  launch provider for  Synspective‚Äôs StriX constellation to date,  successfully deploying three  StriX satellites across three dedicated  Electron launches¬†

Rocket Lab Wins Industry of the Year Award for Stennis Location

Rocket Lab received the prestigious [Industry of the Year Award](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=42323fcd30&e=56a66a2a9a)   at the Hancock Chamber Business & Industry Awards Gala in August.   The annual awards recognize outstanding achievements in citizenship,   industry and business in Hancock County, Mississippi. ¬†  
We opened our  facility at the Stennis Space Center in 2022 and the site  will be used  to test the new Archimedes engines for the Neutron rocket  coming in  2024.¬†

When   we expanded our Space Systems division, we created a vertical   integration strategy where we could build essential elements of a   spacecraft for our own satellites and those built by others. The idea   behind this was everything going to space should have a Rocket Lab logo   on it!¬†

Speaking of‚Ä¶¬†                                      **NASA Psyche Mission** 

NASA‚Äôs  Psyche mission, which will orbit a metal-rich asteroid of the  same  name in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, is  scheduled  to launch in less than 30 days on 5 October 2023! ¬†

The spacecraft will use a huge Rocket Lab solar array that will power the spacecraft during its 4-billion-kilometer journey.¬†

**MethaneSAT Mission** 

MethaneSAT,  scheduled to launch no earlier than January 2024, is an  Earth  observation satellite that will monitor and study global methane   emissions to combat climate change. We are providing multiple elements   to make this mission a success including developing the Mission   Operation Center, the solar panels to power the spacecraft, and the   separation system that will eject the satellite to its orbit. This   mission is jointly funded and operated by the Environmental Defense   Fund, an American NGO, and the New Zealand Space Agency ‚Äì the country‚Äôs   first space science mission! ¬†

**Neutron Update**

Neutron,   our mega constellation launcher, continues its development on  schedule.  We‚Äôve now begun Stage 2 tank testing including cryogenic fill  and  pressure cycles to determine structural and sealing integrity and   performance, hydrostat test to prove the structural integrity of the   structure, domes, and hatches, and the fill, press, vent and de-tank   systems and procedures among other structural tests.

Thoughts on Ashlee Vance's new book?,"I just finished When the Heavens Went on Sale, Ashlee Vance's new book detailing Planet Labs, Rocket Lab, Astra, and Firefly. I read Vance's book on Musk when it came out and learned a lot from it. This new book had some really great history and details, and gives us a very inside view of the founding of these exciting companies. However, I must say it was relatively unbalanced. The section on Rocket Lab was short and sweet, and tried to include some negatives/controversies where there weren't really any. The other sections were rife with massive issues with the founders, conflicts, etc. I was honestly looking to learn about companies besides Rocket Lab so I could diversify my position in the space economy, but after reading I just want to hold RKLB more because the others have so many issues. The sections on Astra and Firefly seemed so hopeful, but blatantly ignored the reality that Rocket Lab has worked up a regular cadence with a flight proven vehicle while they are still floundering around.

I did learn some new stuff about Rocket Lab, like how the first electron launch when flawlessly and it was actually a US government software issue that caused them to terminate. What a shame. However, the section on Astra seemed really drawn out when it was effectively chapter after chapter of ""they tried to launch a rocket, it was delayed/blew up"" and especially knowing that they never got Rocket 3 to work and won't launch another rocket until 2025, when they're out of cash.

I think the main takeaway for me was how the US government has really muddled the space industry by overreaching. E.g. everyone at NASA having 0 vision besides Pete Worden, multiple agencies cockblocking Max Polyakov for being Ukrainian, and the restrictions on Rocket Lab's development given that most of it happens in New Zealand. 

I wanted to see what you all thought of the book, if you had different impressions, and just get a conversation going around it. While the book should get some more people looking at Rocket Lab, I think it really underplays their accomplishments while trying to inflate the progress of the competition.",19,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1526awp/thoughts_on_ashlee_vances_new_book/

# Introduction

With the 2024 first launch of the Rocket Lab Mega Constellation Launcher‚ÄîThe Neutron‚Äîfast approaching, I decided it is high time for a more up-to-date DD on Rocket Lab. A lot is happening in the industry, the company, and the world. I have decided to dive into the future, fundamentals, industry, funding, financials, dreams, and of course, the memes of the aspiring space company. Now, I am posting my DD into both of the Rocket Lab subreddit, as I am new to writing DD and I want to hit as wide of an audience as I can. One disclaimer (for those who do not like stock talk), this DD is not meant to encourage buying of the stock, nor is it financial advice or a stock-only DD, I merely want to dive into this company and simply spark some discussion on it!

Now, Rocket Lab is a private aerospace manufacturer and small satellite launch service provider. The company was founded in 2006 by Peter Beck and is headquartered in Long Beach, California, with additional facilities in New Zealand and Australia. Rocket Lab specializes in the development and launch of small rockets capable of delivering payloads of up to 300 kilograms to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab‚Äîself-designated as a leader in launch and space systems‚Äîis a company that has a chance at becoming a highly profitable giant over the next decade and beyond. In my honest opinion, Rocket Lab currently thrives off of the crumbs of the current space industry ecosystem. With Space X increasingly focused upon one goal‚Äîthanks to their controversial, yet nevertheless, fearless leader‚Äîbeing Mars, Rocket Labs can (and in my opinion will) become one of the go-to space companies for low earth orbit launches in the near term and in the long-term become one of the go-to space company for launches between the Moon, Venus, and Mars as well. Rocket Lab currently lives off of the crumbs left behind by NASA, Space X, and the United States military-industrial complex.

[  Like these two legends from the movie War Dogs, Rocket Lab is determined to become the go-to space company for transporting all types of goods into orbit. For those of you who have not seen the movie \(I personally highly recommend it\), essentially, when these two start their arms-dealing company, they focus upon all of the small contracts that the government is putting out for arms supplies. The contracts that the big players are ignoring, due to their small sizes, even so, these small contracts are worth hundreds of thousands to low millions. Now, this is where Rocket Lab currently lies in the industry.](https://preview.redd.it/j6wloa05vd4b1.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fc5120309359cb8789b861e68009133ef92d376)

[ \\""A new space race has begun, and most Americans are not even aware of it. This race is not \[about\] political prestige or military power. This new race involves the whole human species in a contest against time.\\"" - Ben Bova ](https://preview.redd.it/iliovpg7vd4b1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=f22e8c01f45a403829c6c681966f1a9a53fab213)

Now, before I dive into everything here, I need every to understand that this industry is on the verge of immense change and rapid evolution. We are currently in the first stage of the world‚Äôs Second Space Race. As a student of History, I can confidently tell you that there are murmurings within the historical community, that this is the case, beginning with the creation and success of Space X‚Äôs first reusable rocket: the Falcon 9. On December 21st of 2015, when the first Falcon 9 was launched and the landing was successful with the first stage fully recovered, the race began. In the same way that there is no single company above all others in the airline, shipping & transportation, or car manufacturing industries, is the same reason I do not believe that Space X will alone run the space industry‚Äôs transportation needs. There is plenty of room for companies like Rocket Lab to fill the gaps Space X cannot and in a decade‚Äôs time, there will be plenty of room for even more companies. Yet, there are no companies that are even close to competing with Space X‚Äîother than Rocket Lab‚Äîat this time. Now, I won‚Äôt go deeply into most of these competitors in this deep dive, but to be short, Astra is on the verge of total failure, Virgin Galactic has been playing an entirely different game‚Äîspace tourism, which there is a massive market for, just perhaps won‚Äôt be penetrated by them‚Äîthey likewise seem to be failing. While Blue Origin has been playing a strong game and Space X an even stronger one, albeit more and more focused solely on Mars as the years go on.

[ Here you can see the 1-year charts of Rocket Lab, Astra, Virgin, and Boeing for reference, as you can see, these charts speak volumes. Rocket Lab has been having a tough year but has found a nice bottom and is consistently bouncing from lows in the $3.6-4 range. While Astra has been reduced to a penny stock, with their future unknown. Virgin Galactic is only maintaining below Rocket Lab‚Äôs share price, partly due to the large number of Retail investors that do not know much and refuse to let it die, coupled with a small hope that the company can recover in the coming years. Boeing is here for reference as to what a successful, large-cap company involved in a similar industry \(and the space industry as well\), should look like over the course of a decent year. ](https://preview.redd.it/4lgxhawavd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d24878b2d7dc72b1e5c87ccd01d67c077485001a)

*Now, there are a few assumptions that I am making that we need to cover before diving into the real DD:* Whether it be because we live in the beginnings of a second Space Race (fueled by privatized space companies and the world‚Äôs governments) or because of technological advancement and a rising interest in space, the increase in rocket launches, space development (in Earth‚Äôs orbit, the Moon, and Mars), and the lowering costs of space launches‚Ä¶ it will become exponentially cheaper, easier, and faster to launch into orbit and the industry as a whole will have a massive boom‚Äîakin, in a way, to the industrial revolution‚Äîover the mid-to-late 2020s into the early 2030s. With the mid-to-end 2030s and early 2040s, we will see massive developments in terms of low-Earth orbit manufacturing facilities, tourist destinations, and stations, as well as settlements on the Moon for mining and refueling for greater exploration and colonization of the Sol System as a whole.

Now these are in part assumptions, but I think once one does the research and looks at the fact, all of this is very achievable. Even if it does not occur in this way, you can shift the dates by an additional decade and every time you do, the more likely, easier, and cheaper it all becomes.

Rocket Lab's business model revolves around providing cost-effective and frequent access to space for small satellite operators. The company aims to simplify the process of deploying satellites by offering dedicated launches on its Electron rocket. Rocket Lab operates as an end-to-end service provider, handling the entire launch process from mission planning and payload integration to launch and on-orbit operations.

# Section 1: Rocket Lab Takes Flight! The Electron & the Neutron

[  ‚ÄòRocket Lab is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, complete spacecraft design and manufacturing, satellite components, flight software, and an on-orbit management.‚Äô ‚Äì Rocket Labs](https://preview.redd.it/nbt3cd8dvd4b1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc518b0149113dc115f082394c2b6e8b33e36707)

Rocket Lab's primary launch vehicle, the Electron, is a two-stage rocket powered by Rutherford engines, which use electric-pump-fed LOX/RP-1 propellants. The Electron is designed to optimize cost, flexibility, and rapid launch capability for small satellites. Rocket Lab has demonstrated numerous successful launches since its inaugural flight in 2017, showcasing its technological prowess and reliability. The small satellite market has been growing rapidly, driven by increased demand for data collection, communications, and Earth observation. Rocket Lab's focus on dedicated launches for small satellites positions it well to capture a significant portion of this expanding market. The company has already established a solid customer base, securing contracts with government agencies, research institutions, and commercial entities.

Rocket Labs‚Äîat the time of writing this‚Äîhas had 37 launches‚Äîwith a 91.89% success rate‚Äîdeployed 164 satellites, operates 3 launch pads, and is maintaining 3 Photon Satellites in the Earth‚Äôs orbit. Of the 164 satellites launched by Rocket Labs, they were commissioned to do so by a wide variety of clients, from NASA, Space Force, DARPA, to Canon. Rocket Labs is supported by Future Fund: Australia‚Äôs Sovereign Wealth Fund, Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Data Collective, Greenspring Associates, ACC, Promus Ventures, L One W One Ltd., and Lockheed Martin.

Rocket Lab‚Äôs main rocket, the Electron‚Äîbuilt and operated by Rocket Lab‚Äîhas flown 37 times and been successful 34 times, with only 3 failures. Rocket Lab‚Äôs key areas of business penetration lie in the launch of mid-sized service rockets, the manufacturing of space systems and satellites, and their adept ability to manufacture industrial space parts, applications, and proponents. The latter of which, they are sort of unopposed in terms of competition.

The Neutron‚ÄîRocket Lab‚Äôs medium-lift, mega constellation launcher‚Äîwill be able to launch 13,000 kilograms into low Earth orbit and it will be ‚Ä¶drum roll please‚Ä¶ reusable! The current goal is for it to launch in 2024. It will be designed for not only low earth orbital supply missions, but also deep space missions, and even human spaceflight. It will be fairing a design allowing for full reusability of the first stage and it will be lightweight, being made of Rock Lab‚Äôs own carbon composite structure. The home base for the Neutron will be at the Neutron Production Complex and the launch pad at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility and Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.

[ ‚ÄòThe Neutron Production Complex will be home to a rocket production, assembly, and integration facility, as well as a dedicated launch pad for the Neutron rocket located on the southern end of Wallops Island. The estimated 250,000 square foot state-of-the-art complex will be constructed on a 28-acre site adjacent to the Wallops Island Flight Facility and will include a Launch Control Center, Rocket Lab‚Äôs fifth global operations center for launch activities and on-orbit operations. To support rapid production of the Neutron rocket, current plans for the complex include automated fiber placement robotic production systems capable of laying up meters of Neutron‚Äôs new, specially formulated carbon composite structures in minutes. As a reusable rocket, Neutron is designed to land back on the Launch Complex 3 pad after a mission and from there it would be returned to the production complex for refurbishment and re-flight.‚Äô ](https://preview.redd.it/k592skwfvd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=279742c6d6196d860258d747af98f84e71b71470)

With Space X dominating large-load space orbital flight and transportation, Rocket Labs, in my honest opinion, is where Space X was roughly something like 6-8 years ago. While Rocket Lab intends to compete with Space X‚Äîwhether it will be considered competition in an industry this brand new and small, time will tell‚Äîfor cargo and humans to the low Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and even Venus! Space X and Elon Musk have made it abundantly clear that the goal of Space X is the large-scale settlement of Mars. While later models of Rocket Lab‚Äôs Neutron will be able to go to Mars and Venus, it appears that is not their main goal. In the near term (being the next two decades), they will be looking to dominate the low Earth orbit and Moon market as well as the manufacturing of industrial space parts, applications, and proponents.

# Section 2: The Space Industry & Company Fundamentals

Rocket Lab faces competition from other commercial launch providers, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. However, the company differentiates itself by specializing in small satellite launches, offering a tailored solution for this niche market. Rocket Lab's Electron rocket provides the advantage of dedicated launches and the flexibility to reach specific orbits, making it an attractive option for small satellite operators.

Rocket Lab has raised significant funding through various investment rounds, securing capital from venture capital firms, strategic partners, and government entities. Notable investors include Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Lockheed Martin. The company's ability to attract substantial investment indicates confidence in its business model and growth potential. Rocket Lab operates within the regulatory framework of the countries in which it launches its rockets. The company holds necessary licenses and approvals from government agencies, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Compliance with safety regulations and adherence to environmental guidelines are crucial aspects of Rocket Lab's operations.

Despite its achievements, Rocket Lab faces several risks and challenges. The space industry is highly competitive, and the success of the company depends on its ability to secure launch contracts and maintain a steady launch cadence. Regulatory changes, launch failures, or delays could impact Rocket Lab's operations and reputation. Additionally, the emergence of new technologies or market disruptors could pose a threat to the company's market position

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room, the Quarterly Results. To preface, negative quarterly results mean‚Äîpardon my French‚Äîjack-shit (at least in the short term) for a company such as Rocket Lab, that is looking at penetrating a market such as the space industry. We are going to look at the past four Quarterly Results in chronological order.

**Q2 2022 Report:** Rocket Lab achieved record revenue of $55.5 million, showing significant growth compared to the previous quarter (36% sequential growth) and the same quarter in the previous year (392% YoY growth). Despite the revenue growth, the company reported a negative EPS of $-0.08, indicating a net loss for the quarter.

**Q3 2022 Report:** Another record revenue was achieved, reaching $63.1 million, with a sequential growth of 14% and an impressive YoY growth of 1,093%. The company's EPS improved slightly to $-0.07 but still remained negative. The fourth quarter revenue is expected to be lower, ranging between $51 million and $54 million, as a launch customer's push extends into 2023.

**Q4 2022 Report:** The company's revenue for Q4 reached $51.8 million, showing a healthy year-over-year growth of 88%. The full-year revenue for fiscal 2022 amounted to $211 million, reflecting substantial growth of 239% compared to the previous year. The EPS remained negative at $-0.08.

**Q1 2023 Report:** The revenue for Q1 2023 was $54.9 million. Increasing revenue by 35% in the first quarter of 2023. Revenue from their launch business was $19.6 million, up $12 million from the prior quarter. Their EPS was $-0.08, indicating strong maintenance of their business. The second quarter is expected to show a significant revenue increase, with an estimated range of $60 million to $63 million.

Now, what does this all tell us? Firstly, they were very forthcoming with the quarterly expectations. Something one might think is not a big deal, but considering how a lot of publicly traded companies operate, this is a good thing. In each of their earnings reports, they have nearly exactly estimated their results, showing they are not attempting to mislead investors. The company has experienced impressive revenue growth throughout the reported quarters, indicating strong market performance and demand for its products/services. However, the negative EPS values suggest that the company is still operating at a net loss. From a shareholder‚Äôs perspective, the company's focus should be on achieving profitability and reducing the negative EPS, while maintaining consistent revenue growth. In my opinion, this stock is sitting just below a fair market value for what it is right now, sitting at just over $4, considering they are not fully profitable. Yet Rocket Lab continues to grow its business, making more contracts, and it stands a competitive chance. If they can turn a profit within 2-3 years, I think they will be one hell of a company. With their competitors failing left and right and none finding the success as Rocket Lab‚Äîother than Space X‚Äîthey could stand to be a massive company in a few decades, so massive, they‚Äôre bigger than Earth.

One last financial point to touch upon‚Ä¶ shorting, so here is some data, which is roughly one month outdated due to my difficulty in finding up-to-date information on the company without a Bloomberg Terminal (So, if anyone on the sub has access to a Bloomberg Terminal and would like to add to my DD in the comments, please do).

**Last Record Date:** May 15, 2023

**Outstanding Shares:** 478,660,000 shares

**Float Size:** 262,310,000 shares

**Short Percent of Float:** 9.80% (The short percent of float represents the percentage of shares available for trading that have been sold short).

**Average Trading Volume:** 4,044,396 shares

**Current Short Volume:** 25,710,000 shares

**Previous Short Volume:** 24,630,000 shares

**Change Vs. Previous Month**: +4.38%

**Dollar Volume Sold Short:** $111.58 million

**Short Interest Ratio / Days to Cover:** 7.7 (This ratio indicates the number of days it would take for the short sellers to cover their positions based on the average daily trading volume.).

The short interest in Rocket Lab has increased from the previous month, with a change of +4.38%. The short percent of the float is 9.80%, indicating that a significant portion of the available shares for trading has been sold short. Now, Rocket Lab‚Äôs short interest is relatively low for a company that has had consistent negative EPS and revenue. Showcasing that the big players in markets either A) believe this company will make a massive turnaround in the near future (1-3 years mark) or B) Rocket Lab, due to its size, is thankfully not on their radar. However, that said, the off-exchange short percentage is 57.69%, showcasing that A) public on-exchange short volume is a complete hoax and Hedge Funds, and other big players are beating down on the stock or B) all of this information is completely misrepresented to retail traders on purpose and the entirety of the United States market system is a complete farce.

# Section 3: Future Prospects & Big Moves

Rocket Lab has demonstrated strong performance and growth potential in the emerging small satellite launch market. The company continues to refine its launch processes, aiming to increase launch frequency and reduce costs further. Additionally, Rocket Lab has plans to develop a larger reusable rocket called Neutron, targeting the medium-lift market segment, which would expand its capabilities and market reach. The company has the potential to be the go-to company for low Earth orbital launches in the short term and in the long term, one of, if not the go-to company, for transportation to the Moon, Mars, and Venus.

[  Peter Beck, founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, did an interview last month on his take on the industry and their future prospects. I wanted to touch briefly on this \(you can find the video on YouTube\).](https://preview.redd.it/ced7t9iivd4b1.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=6579fcd100b405f44d1e65fb13cb185cefe6ed76)

Firstly, the video begins with the commentator stating, ""*With the Space Race this week*,"" the Space X rocket, the most powerful ever built, has scrubbed its launch. While Rocket Lab is adding a new service for testing hypersonic sub-orbital launches, being a welcome addition to the company‚Äôs wide array of services. Beck states that it is a very exciting time, stating that ‚Äú*the United States is kind of lacking behind in hypersonic technologies and this is a great opportunity to have high cadence, test flight environment for these payloads to really move forward the US‚Äôs hypersonic research*.‚Äù He goes on to talk about how these capabilities are essentially repurposed from Rocket Lab‚Äôs Electron Rocket capabilities: ‚Äú*We take a standard Electron orbital-class launch vehicle and we fly it in some really unique trajectories to provide these hypersonic trajectories‚Ä¶ it is taking an Electron and making a couple wee tweaks to it and having a great high frequency hypersonic testing platform that hasn‚Äôt existed*.‚Äù Beck goes on to speak on the launch cadence ‚Äú*being on target for 15 flights*‚Äù this year with the fastest turn around this year being 7 days between flights, saying ‚Äú*the machine is cranking and the vehicles are flying successfully and the last flight was a reusable vehicle and we splashed that down successfully and now we‚Äôre kind at the point where we are recycling and harvesting engines and components off of those launch vehicles and getting ready to put them back into service and re-fly them*.‚Äù He continues, stating, ‚Äú*I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm allowed to say exactly, but‚Ä¶ a whole multiple gambit of reused components that are all now re-entering the production line and going back into service*.‚Äù Morgan Brennan, the interviewer then speaks to how there is this emerging mismatch between supply and demand when it comes to the satellite launch market, with the fact that there are so many satellite constellations that are poised to go into orbit in the coming years and not enough capacity in terms of launching them. So, she then asks about the reusability of Electron and the development of the Neutron. Beck states that, ‚Äú*Electron is really serving that market very well, and there are lots of flight opportunities that are sort of just doing its thing, Neutron is the new flight opportunity for us‚Ä¶ 2026 to 2030 timeframe there is a massive deficit in launch and there are lots of constellations that are all really vying for an ability to get in orbit, so we saw that coming and started work on the vehicle and hopefully we can bring it into service in 2024 and really solve some of those problems and take advantage of that market opportunity*.‚Äù

Now, I don‚Äôt have to tell you all that this is very good to hear from Beck and this is very exciting, showcasing that he really believes Rocket Lab can penetrate this market and become a big player in the ever-evolving industry.

**Rocket Lab Making Big Moves Lately:**

¬∑ Bought Virgin Orbit HQ in California, this was a big win for the company, and folk on the sub were very excited to see this happen. Yay! But, sad and unfortunate for Virgin Galactic, which I am sure many of us space enthusiasts had higher hopes for, oh well, not everyone can achieve their dreams.

¬∑ Rocket Lab reached a new Company record of nine launches within a calendar year.

¬∑ Achieved a record of 100% mission success for Electron launches for the year.

¬∑ Successfully launched CAPSTONE mission to the Moon for NASA, including the first demonstration of Lunar Photon spacecraft platform.

¬∑ Launched three successful Electron missions in the first quarter for commercial constellation operators HawkEye 360, Capella Space, and BlackSky.

¬∑ Successfully completed the Company‚Äôs first launch from its U.S. launch site, Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2, at the Virginia Spaceport Authority‚Äôs Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on January 24, 2023. The mission deployed three satellites for radio frequency geospatial analytics provider HawkEye 360.

¬∑ Successfully completed the Company‚Äôs fastest turnaround between launches to date ‚Äì just seven days between its 34th Electron launch, ‚ÄúStronger Together‚Äù, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 in Virginia on March 16, 2023, and its 35th Electron launch, ‚ÄúThe Beat Goes On‚Äù, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand on March 24, 2023.

¬∑ Rocket Lab remains the only U.S. commercial small launch provider to successfully deliver satellites to orbit in 2023. Secured a multi-mission contract with Capella Space to launch four more dedicated launches on Electron in 2023.

¬∑ Achieved programmatic milestones for the Company‚Äôs two Photon spacecraft to support NASA‚Äôs ESCAPADE mission to Mars, and for the Photon spacecraft for a Varda Space Industries‚Äô mission to manufacture high-value products in zero gravity. Both Photon programs include Rocket Lab star trackers, reaction wheels, solar panels, flight software, and radios ‚Äì demonstrating the value and strength of the Company‚Äôs vertical integration and in-house supply chain.

# Conclusion: An Ode to Humanity's Future

Rocket Lab has established itself as a leading player in the small satellite launch market, offering dedicated launch services tailored to the needs of small satellite operators. The company's technological capabilities, solid customer base, and innovative approach position it well for future growth.

Those who lived and grew up in the 1960s and 1970s believed that by the 21st century, mankind would be a space-faring civilization. People had a fascination with the unknown. It was embedded in pop culture, in movies like the 2001 Space Odyssey, Alien, and the Star Trek series. But the unfortunate truth is that after Apollo 17 on the 19th of December 1972, mankind has not left low-earth orbit. The American public lost interest, the government cut funding, and the Saturn V rockets were dismantled and replaced by space shuttles in the 1980s (spaceships not even built to leave low-earth orbit). The curiosity and desire to unravel the mystery of the universe are now again filling the hearts of people. Technology is becoming more advanced and cheaper.

With companies like Rocket Lab and Space X, the future is looking bright. We currently live in an era of mass information. One of the hardest aspects of life in the early-21st-century is learning how to filter all this information. The news of the accomplishments of Rocket Lab, Space X, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA), the European Space Agency (ESA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Space Force, are lost in the large volume of collective data. The average person does not believe how close we are to colonizing Luna and Mars; how close we are to becoming a multi-planetary species. If you walked up to someone on the street of New York City, today, and told them that in the mid-2040s, and by the latest, the 2050s, there will be hundreds if not thousands of people living in Earth's orbit, the upper atmosphere of Venus, the Moon, and Mars, the person would dismiss you in disbelief. But the same would have happened if you walked up to a person on the street of New York City on the 19th of July 1962 (before Kennedy‚Äôs speech) and told them that mankind would step foot on the moon in seven years. Companies like Rocket Lab, which will make orbital flight and transportation affordable, will allow for a new era of civilization, one which was only present and dreamed of in science fiction of the past.

[The Earth, as imaged from the Voyager 1 spacecraft, was suspended in a sunbeam, as the interstellar craft exited the Sol system in 1990. Earth is nearly 4 billion miles away in this image. That is us. That is humanity, all of us that have thus far, ever existed. We take to the stars in search of not only answers but in search of a purpose.](https://preview.redd.it/hnr23odlvd4b1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=298a1ee80b0bc5e3dc0ba5c3c61aa6a25c0682c1)

Rocket Lab to launch 2 missions for NASA hurricane-watching constellation,,117,9,https://www.space.com/rocket-lab-launch-nasa-tropics-hurricane-watching-satellites
Neutron launching Kuiper Satellites for Amazon?,"Hi All,

I was thinking, what are the chances for Amazon awarding launch contract to RocketLab Neutron for its Kuiper Satellites?

RocketLab is already going to deliver reaction wheels (2-3K a year) for Kuiper. RocketLab also recently launched a high-volume star tracker (maybe also for Kuiper). All in all, seems like RocketLab is going to do a lot of work for Kuiper. Then why not launch also?

Amazon did sign launch contracts with Vulcan Centaur (ULA), New Glenn (BO) and Ariane 6 (ArianeSpace). All these medium to heavy lift launch vehicles are delayed and won't see a multiple launch cadence before 2025/2026. It is even questionable whether ULA and ArianeSpace can achieve a high launch cadence as their vehicles are expendable.

Amazon Kuiper is in a hurry to catch up with starlink, so they do not really have the luxury to wait. Therefore, I think there a good chances that RocketLab will get launch contracts from Amazon Kuiper. Neutron could potentially launch 4 or more times in 2025 and then scale rapidly from there i.e. providing Amazon Kuiper with better performance than all of the current launch contract holders.

A Neutron rocket could put roughly 18 Kuiper satellites (700kg per satellite) in orbit per launch at a price of $50 million. $ per kg will definitely be lower than with Vulcan Centaur and Ariane 6.

Rocket Lab ‚Äòvery happy‚Äô with Space Force plan to procure launch services - SpaceNews,,87,9,https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-very-happy-with-space-force-plan-to-procure-launch-services/
Speculation on the long-term evolution of commercial launch in this decade (with an eye towards heavy lift as well as Relativity Space),"Hey all,

Just thought I'd put this out there as purely hypothetical (borderline tinfoil) speculation on what could happen in the years to come as the commercial launch market continues to evolve.

First off, a fun thought exercise - what would you name a potential heavy-lift launch vehicle that Rocket Lab could develop after Neutron?

Peter Beck has mentioned recently that they have no plans on retreading the rocket development path, but if SpaceX manages to get the Starship system operational this decade and it disrupts the industry like everyone thinks it will, Rocket Lab may be forced to adapt once again.

In that case, after looking at a variety of options, I personally like Hadron^1 the most. It already has name recognition thanks to CERN's Large Hadron Collider. Additionally, the neutron itself is a member of the hadron class of subatomic particles.

So, not only would Hadron be a logical progression from a particle physics perspective, it would also have instant name recognition. Just imagine: ""Rocket Lab's Hadron Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle"" - rolls off the tongue rather nicely eh?

Second, I got to thinking about consolidation in the commercial launch sector moving forward, as an economic downturn looms and we exit the near-zero interest rate environment that led to the previous decade's boom in launch startups. Many executives in the industry ([including Beck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qcHd13G6yQ)) have made public statements about this in the past couple of years.

Other small launch newcomers already have strong ties to large defense primes that may suggest acquisition down the line (e.g. Lockheed Martin with ABL and Northrop Grumman with Firefly)

The only two remaining non-""billionaire funded"" U.S. commercial LV players with significant financial runways are Rocket Lab and Relativity Space.

I've read previous threads on this sub discussing Relativity and the sentiment seems to be that despite the fact that they've yet to launch, they are a competitor worth paying attention to due to significant private investor interest, high quality talent (mostly ex-SpaceX), and potentially game-changing proprietary tech.

Once again, if Starship proves to work as advertised, and/or macroeconomic conditions continue to deteriorate, market participants may be forced to consolidate in order to survive. Precedent is currently being set in the satellite operator space as multi-billion dollar players have begun M&A processes under growing pressure from Starlink (e.g. Oneweb / Eutelsat and Viasat / Inmarsat). While less common, we've also previously seen consolidation in the launch industry, with Lockheed + Boeing's ULA JV, Airbus + Safran's ArianeGroup JV, and Orbital + ATK's merger. Aerojet Rocketdyne's recent tie-ups with Northrop and L3Harris also come to mind. Granted, each of these cases is unique, but anything is possible in this space, regardless of how large or established a company is.

Thus, I see no inherent reason why a Rocket Lab + Relativity merger couldn't be possible down the line, assuming both companies continue to grow and execute at pace. (A major assumption, to be sure!)

I realize this is probably the last thing on either company's mind at the moment but hear me out. Below is a big picture list of observations on both companies, with an emphasis on their similarities and potential synergies:

- Co-location at NASA Stennis for both companies' next-generation reusable methalox engine testing: Both Aeon R and Archimedes test complexes will be located fairly close to each other at Stennis. I wouldn't be surprised to see some degree of cross-pollination between the construction, engineering, and technician staff across both programs
- Both companies are vocal champions of additive manufacturing techniques throughout major components of LV production
- Both companies' headquarters are located just 3 miles away from each other in Long Beach
- Rocket Lab has proven to be a pragmatic, execution-rich organization. Relativity has proven to be a forward-looking, ambition-rich organization. Combining these modalities could in theory lead to an organization greater than the sum of its parts - SpaceX, the current market leader, has both of these elements in spades
- With Neutron, Rocket Lab is optimizing for operational efficiency with partial reusability and RTLS as their north star, whereas with Terran-R, Relativity is leaning on highly novel structures with full reusability as their north star. If Relativity manages to crack the full reusability problem at sub-Starship scale,^2 both companies' tech could combine in a unique way for a joint RL/RS designed heavy lift vehicle (possibly the Hadron as spitballed above)
- Both companies have good design, PR, and marketing (see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2GT204CEVk), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aJ5NPt5fSM), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kwAPr5G6WA), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BhkjEc6Q64), and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Vf3MlbtAs)), which helps excite the general public and attract talent

Curious what everyone here thinks of both the HLV name brainstorm and a potential team-up with Relativity. Obviously there is an extremely low chance of either happening in this decade, but it's fun to think about as these companies race to develop vehicles that will ultimately launch next-gen constellations, commercial space stations, interplanetary missions, and much more.

Footnotes

1. Some alternatives: Graviton, Baryon, Fermion
2. Stoke Space's [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzqhZLgpiv0) also claims to have cracked the full-reusability problem but they are much earlier-stage and have less funding at this point in time. Definitely worth keeping an eye on though.

Today an article just came out on [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/the-gold-rush-for-the-next-round-of-military-launch-contracts-has-started/) with the following quote that piqued my interest:

Why ain't RocketLab be launching?,"Last year, between April and November Rocket Lab was launching once a month:

Then, suddenly it's 11 weeks between November 4th and January 24th. Now, it's been another 5 weeks and still no next launch announced.

Why is this? According to their earnings call today, they have a full Backlog, lot's of missions, and more than enough cash at hand. Electron works reliably. They have two launch sites. Why ain't they launching twice a month?

Thanks for your insights and speculations. I am asking out of curiosity, but also out of a little bit concern as a small investor.",4,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/11f1biy/why_aint_rocketlab_be_launching/
Rocket Lab scraps air-reusability captures in favor of water retrievals.,"Rocket Lab has announced during conference call for Q4 2022 results that it intends to pursue water-based recovery of electron first stages instead of air-reusability captures. Further update was provided by Adam SPice a couple weeks ago who confirmed that last air capture failure due to a loss of telementary was caused due to a failure of one of the paracutes attached to the electron first stage. 

P.S: I tried warning people on this sub about this prospect over a week ago and nobody took me seriously :(

"With Starshield, SpaceX readies for battle","PURSUIT OF DEFENSE DOLLARS
What SpaceX has done with Starlink is to visibly demonstrate how commercial space technology serves national security applications, said Peter Arment, aerospace and defense industry analyst at Baird investment bank.

‚ÄúThis helps SpaceX obviously but also helps the entire industry attract investment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe defense spending space is sort of a rising tide at the moment.‚Äù

Before anyone had ever heard of Starshield, other companies in the space industry started making moves to be better positioned to compete in the national security arena.

Commercial launch provider and satellite manufacturer Rocket Lab on Dec. 1 announced it is establishing a U.S.-based subsidiary for defense and intelligence work, including classified programs.

The new business, called Rocket Lab National Security, will have ‚Äúclose engagement with U.S. government customers to understand their mission requirements, which may be dedicated rapid call-up launch, satellite design, build and integration, spacecraft operations or all of the above,‚Äù Rocket Lab spokesperson Murielle Baker said in a statement.

Tess Hatch, vice president of Bessemer Venture Partners, a Rocket Lab investor, said the mood has shifted from a year ago ‚Äúwhen investors in boardrooms were pounding our fists on the table saying ‚Äògrowth at all cost.‚Äô‚Äù Defense customers can be ‚Äúa little lumpy and unpredictable. However, there are massive potential contracts,‚Äù Hatch said Dec. 6 at the TechCrunch Space conference.

‚ÄúWith markets down and maybe commercial needing to push a little more throttle, the diversity of the customer base is so important,‚Äù Hatch said. ‚ÄúThe government is extra helpful for space companies right now when the commercial side isn‚Äôt as efficient.‚Äù",27,3,https://spacenews.com/with-starshield-spacex-readies-for-battle/

## What is going to be on board for this flight?

Electron will deploy three satellites for radio frequency
geospatial analytics provider HawkEye 360. The
mission will be the first of three Electron launches for
HawkEye 360 in a contract that will see Rocket Lab
deliver 15 satellites to low Earth orbit between late
2022 and 2024. These missions will grow HawkEye
360‚Äôs constellation of radio frequency monitoring
satellites, enabling the company to better deliver
precise mapping of radio frequency emissions
anywhere in the world.

## Quick Facts
+ This will be the **32st** **Electron** from **Rocket Lab's LC-1**.
+ This will be the **9th** Launch for **Rocket Lab** this Year.
+ The Rocket is made out of **2** liquid-fuelled stages and **1** liquid-fuelled kickstage.

[](/# MC // section mission)
# Primary Mission: Deployment of payload into correct orbit

Electron will carry a science research satellite by
space systems provider OHB Sweden for the Swedish
National Space Agency (SNSA). The Mesospheric
Airglow/Aerosol Tomography and Spectroscopy
(MATS) satellite is the basis for the SNSA‚Äôs science
mission to investigate atmospheric waves and
better understand how the upper layer of Earth‚Äôs
atmosphere interacts with wind and weather patterns
closer to the ground. MATS was originally due to fly
on a Russian launch service before the mission was
manifested on Rocket Lab‚Äôs Electron.


The Swedish National Space Agency, SNSA, is a central
governmental agency under the Ministry of Education
and Research. SNSA is responsible for national and
international activities relating to space and remote
sensing, primarily research and development.
The mission‚Äôs science partner is the Department of
Meteorology at Stockholm University (MISU).

[](/# MC // section landing)
# Recovery Attempt

Using a modified Sikorsky S-92 large helicopter, Rocket
Lab will attempt to capture the Electron rocket‚Äôs first
stage mid-air as it returns from space after launch.

Time for Rocket Lab to re-consider air-captures?,"So, given that the last two air-capture attempts both ended in failure, I feel it might be time for Rocket Lab to re-consider it's re-usability program. Earlier this year, Rocket Lab managed to [succesfully re-ignite a first stage engine](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/01/rocket-lab-fires-up-its-first-recovered-engine-on-track-to-full-booster-reusability/) after it was retrieved from the ocean. This suggests that air captures may in fact be unnecessary and instead of further promoting the company to investors, it is actually acheiving the opposite effect due to the [negative media coverage](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/04/business/rocket-lab-helicopter-booster-catch-scn/index.html). My personal recommednation would be to cancel the air-capture attempts and retreive all future booster stages from the ocean using the retreival vessel. This avoids putting lives at undue risk for publicity purposes while still enabling the company to re-use the first stage engines. The helicopters can be re-tasked to spot the landing locations of the booster stages for the retrieval vessel.",0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/yme706/time_for_rocket_lab_to_reconsider_aircaptures/

Why use and Oxygen Rich Closed Cycle on Archimedes and not a Fuel Rich Closed Cycle?,Anyone understand why RocketLab hasn't used a fuel rich staged combustion cycle for their new Archimedes engine but is going with Oxygen rich?  From my very limited understanding (Everyday Astronaut school of Rocket Engine Cycles) is seems like once the fuel is CH and not RP1 the coking problems for a fuel rich pre burner disappear.  This problem must have been solved by SpaceX for their CH fuel rich pre burner on the Raptor.  But it seems that one of the big challenges for Raptor was SpaceX developing a new alloy for their O2 rich pre burner for Raptor.  Is RocketLab working on new alloys for this or has rocket engine metallurgy moved on since the start of Raptor development?,41,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xvqw1q/why_use_and_oxygen_rich_closed_cycle_on/

"~600 kg, RTLS, multi-core, Electron++ ?","~600 kg to LEO, RTLS, multi-core, Electron++ ?

 &nbsp;

**Rationale**

* Competitors are aiming for this payload class, Astra, Virgin Orbit, Firefly (1,000 kg), Terra 1 (1,500 kg)  
* MDA, with RocketLab, is building 500 kg satellites, could be launched by RL  
* Gain RTLS [propulsive landing] experience  
* Gain landing leg experience  
* Gain relight experience 
* Retain staff building rockets for potentially more customers
* Use returned boosters to increase launch cadence


 &nbsp;

**Proposing**  

* Triple booster first stage, no staging  
* Double second-stage or single extended  
* Landing legs for RTLS  
* Maybe larger fairing with dual second stage with interstage  


 &nbsp;

**Possible configuration**  

* Triangle configuration of boosters (no staging), with landing legs, nosecone on one of the boosters  
* Inline configuration of two second stages (no staging) mounted on two of the boosters
* 1 m  or 2 m fairing (which would require new molds) plus funky interstage


 &nbsp;

**Discussion:**  

* A triple booster should have enough reserve propellant and thrust to lift the RTLS propellant, legs and account for extra drag.  Either triple-engine landing or dual-engine landing possibilities (depending on landing mass).  
* A dual booster would mean unmodified second stages fastened together, provide thrust needed for up to 600 kg to LEO.  
* A payload interstage would be needed.  
* Could call it Anion (extra electrons)",0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xt9yt3/600_kg_rtls_multicore_electron/

RocketLab Capsule,"Rocket Lab, during the investor day, presented some illustrations for a human capsule for Neutron. While presenting, the company was very clear that this was not a capsule announcement but they are looking into the topic.

However, what is interesting is the size of the capsule presented with a human for scale. (Another member made a post on how much bigger the capsule is relative to Dragon from SpaceX).

To investigate whether the illustration was a mistake, I did some digging using the 2nd illustration of the capsule with a docking station. I utilized the docking station as a measurement foundation and compared the illustration with a relatively similar picture of a Dragon with a docking station. Here is what I found (rough measurements).

1. RocketLab's capsule is rougly 2.6 times the diameter of the docking station.
2. Dragon is rought 1.8 times the diameter of the docking station.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

1. It seems like that RKLB did not make a mistake when they showed a human for scale. RKLB may indeed be planning a much bigger capsule than Dragon and Starliner. (RKLB rarely makes mistakes on slides and it would be unlikely they made the size mistake on two slides)

Counter-argument; Dragon and Starliner are rougly 12 tonnes. Neutron in expendable mode can deliver 13 tonnes to LEO. Therefore it would be unlikely that they are planning a larger capsule.

Counter-counter argument:

1. RKLB is known for innovation and it is likely that they with the technology of 2025-2026 could develop a much lighter capsule
2. Neutron's performance metrics are based on the rocket performing in a chill mode. More performance could be achieved by pushing the engines to near their limit. i.e. Neutron if need be could potentially deliver +20 tonnes to LEO.

Let me know what you think?

&#x200B;

Update:

ISS docking station actual diameter: 2.4 meters

Estimated dragon diameter: 4.3 (actual 4) meters

Estimated RKLB capsule diameter: 6.2 meters

I.e. my calculations are rough estimates but not far off.",48,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xnqpmj/rocketlab_capsule/

&#x200B;

I will now explain why I believe Rocket Lab will design its own manned spacecraft, and will not use Soyuz spacecraft.

&#x200B;

\-Rocket Lab has recently announced that they plan to deliver cargo around the world, (sort of like E2E).

So obviously they will design a re-entry vehicle...then they could adapt it for the manned missions they have announced.

\-If Rocket Lab were to buy a Soyuz capsule, they would be using Russian technology... and there are problems with Russia.

They would also be wasting money if in the future they want to build their own capsule....

And there are many other factors...

\-The Starliner can't be launched on Neutron in the reusable version, and besides, the starliner doesn't even work lol....

\-In the future there will be several space stations, and RL will not be left behind.

Also, for now Europe doesn't have its own spacecraft, the Susie spacecraft is under development, and according to what ArianeGroup has announced, operational flights will arrive in 2030.

So RL could develop a capsule or support body to sell seats to Europe.

\-The small spacecraft could also serve as a reusable second stage and RL would have a fully reusable multipurpose vehicle.",45,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xivd25/rocket_lab_will_design_its_own_crewed_spacecraft/

Why re-usability isn't a priority for Rocket Lab..,"Some people in the investor group I am a part have been asking why Rocket Lab doesn't seem to be prioritising re-usability. The problem with Electron is that it was never originally designed to be re-usable. The company also [over-estimated demand for the small launch industry](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/peter-beck-explains-why-electron-may-only-ever-launch-10-15-times-a-year/) and thus is producing Electron rockets at a faster rate than they are being used. Therefore, re-usability currently serves no purpose other than to boost the company's reputation. I suspect they also do not want another failed catch as this could damage the company's reputation and leed to a loss of confidence amoung investors. Personally, I suspect Rocket Lab will eventually do away with in-air captures and simply retrieve the first stages out of the ocean.",20,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xfgnjx/why_reusability_isnt_a_priority_for_rocket_lab/

Can Rocket Lab Replicate Starlink-TMobile Arrangement?,"I was fascinated by the latest announcement of an agreement between Starlink and T-Mobile, for  globe-spanning cellphone service coverage:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5DdP9uvkEs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5DdP9uvkEs)

This will surely be a Killer App for SpaceX's upcoming Starship launch vehicle, deploying their upcoming Starlink v2 satellites into orbit. There will surely be a demand for this type of communication network if it works as advertised, fulfilling the promise of what Iridium was supposed to be.

I was wondering whether Rocket Lab with its own in-house expertise from its family of satellite component builders might be able to come up with a comparable solution as this. Something like that would surely create demand for Neutron's launch services, especially with the rapid launch turnaround Neutron is meant for.

So Neutron obviously won't have a fairing as large as Starship's, but could some of the well-known origami techniques be used to create large unfolding antenna arrays that could snugly fit into Neutron's payload fairing for launch? Elon Musk said Starlink v2 would be using the world's most advanced Phased Array antennae, which could both detect the comparatively weaker signals from cellphones and compensate for Doppler frequency shift. Is anything like that within the capabilities of Rocket Lab or its family of subsidiary companies?

Surely a globe-spanning mobile cellular telecom network would be the ultimate demand-driver for the kind of launch cadence Neutron aspires to.",27,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wzw1lb/can_rocket_lab_replicate_starlinktmobile/

Rocket Lab Q2 Summary ‚Äî Smart and Scrappy R&D Sets Them Apart From Competition,,20,2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oc2QQIbso
"Rocket Lab's path to Profitability: Increasing SolAero Gross Margins, Electron Recovery, and Responsive Launches","In Rocket Lab's [earnings call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE) yesterday, they made some very interesting statements about how the company plans to increase gross margins and achieve profitability.

First, Rocket Lab [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE&t=2622s) that increasing gross margin on AolAero is the best thing that they can do to improve profitability on the Space Systems side. Rocket Lab said that they have a 24 month plan to increase SolAero gross margins from ""high single digits"" to a whopping 30%! They said that they are very confident in this plan, and that executing on it is only a matter of time. Rocket Lab said that revenue from the acquired companies SolAero, Advanced Solutions Inc, and Planetary Systems Corporation was $28M in Q2 2022, and the vast majority (> $20M?) was from SolAero. Therefore, increasing the gross margin to 30% on SolAero revenue is a really big deal!

Secondly, Rocket Lab [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE&t=3102s) that for their new [Responsive Space Program](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-introduces-responsive-space-program/), the cost per launch is 15-30% higher than the typical Electron launch price of $7.5M, and the vast majority of that 15-30% markup goes directly to gross margin since most of their launch costs are fixed costs. Between Electron reuse (70% of cost is in the first stage) and responsive launches, I see a clear path to increasing the gross margins of Electron!

These statements really help to paint a clear path to profitability in my mind. With stronger than expected revenues and a clear path to profitability, it‚Äôs no wonder that Rocket Lab stock surged over 20% today. What do you guys think? What do you think Rocket Lab's plans for SolAero are? Increasing automation? Integration of solar panels into other components? Outsourcing of manufacturing? I sure hope it isn‚Äôt outsourcing, the United States really needs to manufacture its own solar panels.",73,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wmsfbg/rocket_labs_path_to_profitability_increasing/

Blue Origin's New Glenn [has been selected by Amazon to carry out at least 12 launches for project Kuiper](https://www.blueorigin.com/news/amazon-selects-new-glenn-for-kuiper/). Rocket Lab on the other hand, has no publicly stated launch contracts for it's Neutron Rocket. However, it has been [awared a contract by the U.S Space Force to develop the Neutron upper stage worth approx 24.35 million](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-wins-24m-u-s-space-force-contract-to-develop-neutron-upper-stage/). It seems from this that Rocket Lab has already missed out on a number of cruicial launch contracts from the commercial space sector. Though they have been recognised by the U.S Space Force and with their recent Electron launches for the NRO, it is possible that Neutron may be selected as the go-to for the defense sector in the United States. With rising geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and now Taiwan, it would not surprise me if the majority of Neutron's launches were comprised of defense contracts provided by the U.S Space Force, NRO and possibly others.",30,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wlist1/neutron_could_endup_becoming_the_goto_for_defense/
"My gut feeling: Solaero acquisition was a mistake, and perhaps a very bad one","I expressed a lot of concerns back in December about that acquisition:
 - 5 % gross margins: there is not really any cost savings with this acquisition. Why not just buy the solar panels directly from a third party, just like I assume spaceX does??? SpaceX doesn‚Äôt seem to have any issues sourcing solar panels!
 - Massive 60 % expansion of headcount at rocketlab
 - Rocketlab has 0 experience in solar panels construction
 - Massive distraction on top of the many challenges the company already faces 

To the list above we can now 
 - add a massive market meltdown
 - runaway inflation, which likely is going to be a big deal when selling something manufacturing intensive with 5 % gross margin

Was this acquisition motivated by the revenue increase from the low margin solar panels? I sincerely hope not. Because here‚Äôs the deal: most investors don‚Äôt give any multiple multiple to this.

I listened to the earning call today‚Ä¶ and I can‚Äôt help but feel that my concerns were warranted. Very negative contribution to gross margins.

I read this [report](https://csps.aerospace.org/sites/default/files/2022-07/Cavaciuti-Davis-Heying_ISAM_20220715.pdf) and with all the changes happening now, Neutron, NG and Firefly, One web merging with that French company, ect...  How will Rocket Lab deal with this new tech that is being developed?

Photon will need an upgrade to be a servicer tug, better engine, and robotic arm. Instead of pumping fuel, I like quick exchange of fuel tanks, less mess. This means someone has to build a tank farm in several orbital planes.

Building satellites  on orbit may give Electron new life, ferrying new components to old satellites. Reaching GEO with the weight/ mass of a big reaction wheel may be out of reach, but new sensors should be doable.

Is Relativity Space overpromising?,"I acknowledge that this is a bit of a rhetorical question, because RS hasn't launched yet, but that's kind of the point. They haven't launched Terran 1 yet, but they've announced plans with insane deadlines to send a second generation launch vehicle that's going to be as big as Starship to Mars (and beat SpaceX there, no less). Somehow, even though they haven't launched anything, they have enormous amounts of funding and a [pad at Cape Canaveral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_Space#Cape_Canaveral_LC-16). They will be having the [first launch](https://www.spacelaunchschedule.com/launch/terran-1-maiden-flight/) of Terran 1 later this month.

Full admission, I'm biased against RS because I'm invested in RKLB, and RS is a private company which us retail investors aren't able to invest in. If RS is as good as they claim to be, then they would obviously be a threat to RKLB, which until now, has been second best next to SpaceX, and the best space launch investment option on the public markets by far.

At the same time, I see the wild claims that RS makes, and it makes my bullshit detector want to go off. Sure, RS has cool 3D printing tech, but does that really qualify them as rocket designers? Rocket engineering is notoriously hard. Announcing ambitious plans and timelines for a second generation vehicle when you haven't even launched one of your first generation vehicles reeks both of arrogance and of inexperience. It seems pretty obvious that they will want to make many changes to the design of their vehicles and iterate.

Technology wise, I get that they have a cool metal 3D printer, but it makes me cringe every time I hear them say that their technology is powered by ""AI"". To me, that says that the company is relying on buzzwords to lure naive investors that have no understanding of the technology involved. We also know that their rocket is not, in fact, fully 3D printed. I personally doubt that their construction method is particularly cost-effective, but that remains to be seen.

This last point is debatable, but I also feel like the relatively large size of the Terran 1 rocket is an error. It's a fairly large two-stage vehicle. If you've ever used a 3D printer, you know that the time needed to print something increases rapidly with the size of the object. Having a large rocket means that your prints take much longer, which in turn means that you iterate quite a bit slower. RS could have chosen to start by printing a smaller suborbital rocket so they can really test their technology, iterate rapidly on design changes, and then go for an orbital vehicle when they have more experience. Instead they're directly going for a large two-stage rocket and trying to launch it to orbit. If they need to iterate on this, it will take longer and be more costly.

RS is having their first launch later this month. Maybe they'll succeed and we'll all be really impressed that they've nailed it on their first try. Or maybe Terran 1 will blow up, there will be months of delays after that, and we'll eventually find out that RS has more in common with Nikola than SpaceX.",42,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wiex5n/is_relativity_space_overpromising/

Rocket Lab generating negative revenue on Electron Launches?,"Hey, so I'm part of a small investor group on Discord which follows space stocks. Recently one of our members [revealed that Rocket Lab is operating electron launches at a net loss](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/998003492503421018/1005151082512662588/IMG_0619.png?width=1200&height=301). He came to this conclusion after digging around in the quarterly earnings reports which report revenues and expenses related to launches and then counted the number of launches in that quarter by referring to Rocket Lab's [completed missions](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/) page. Now obviously, this may not be entirely unexpected for a company that is still relatively new. However, I find the lack of transparency regarding this issue concerning. Investors should not have to go to this level of detail just to uncover that a company is generating negative returns on launches. Obviously, they are generaing revenues from their subsidiary companies as well as the sales of [reaction wheels](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/space-systems/satellite-components/reaction-wheels/) and [star trackers](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/space-systems/satellite-components/star-trackers/). Hopefully, as launch cadence improves and re-usability becomes more streamlined, the company may end up breaking even. Don't get me wrong, I love what Rocket Lab does (it's amazing), but I just feel a little.. annoyed that Peter Beck hasn't stated that they are generating negative revenues from the launches.

&#x200B;

Additional information regarding calculations:

1. CoR = Cost of Revenue r/L = Revenue per launch CoR/L = Cost of Revenue per Launch
2. \*\*\*\[***4:33 AM***\]\*\*\*I don‚Äôt know what was going on in Q3 21\` so I pulled that out of the margin calculation, since it felt like an outlier. With that in, margin would have obviously been MUCH lower.

"So now that Astra won‚Äôt be launching anything until probably 2024, what does this mean for Rocket Lab?","Astra has [cancelled](https://spacenews.com/astra-cancels-rocket-3-to-focus-on-larger-vehicle/) the Rocket 3 program and says they won‚Äôt launch any customer payloads until around 2024 when Rocket 4 is ready. Personally, I think Astra will go bankrupt before Rocket 4 is ready. The issue is that Astra is burning through their cash at a rate of $85M per quarter, have zero revenue, and have only $200M in cash left. I don‚Äôt see any good way for Astra to raise more money, either. At the time of this posting, Astra has a $343.40M market cap, which shows that most of the value of the company is just that $200M pile of cash. Once that cash is gone, so is their market cap and their ability to raise more capital.

In their earnings call yesterday, Astra also said that Rocket 3 was not a commercially viable product, and even if it did work reliably, there were simply not enough interested customers for it to be successful. Apparently satellites are growing in size and customers want larger rockets like Terran R, as evidenced by Relativity Space‚Äôs ridiculous [$1.2B backlog](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/30/relativity-space-inks-deal-with-oneweb-reaches-1-2b-in-terran-r-launch-contracts/).

I wonder what this means for Rocket Lab and the future of Electron? In my opinion, it looks like Electron might be the only smallsat launcher left standing. There is little incentive for anyone else to develop a competitor for Electron since it seems that rockets of this size are not commercially viable. But there is a silver lining. Rocket Lab is at least able to mostly break even on their Electron launches. This gives them an extremely cost effective R&D testbed to develop the technology they need for Neutron. Electron also gives Rocket Lab publicity and helps them to build up launch heritage and relationships with customers.

Did Rocket Lab take inspiration from Pioneer 13 for it's Venus Mission?,"Pioneer 13, also known as Pioneer Venus 2, was a mission carried out by NASA as part of their Pioneer Program which involved sending a range of probes to various objects within the solar system. The design chosen by Rocket Lab has quite a few distinct similarities' to the Pioneer Venus 2 but also a couple noticeable differences. One of the similarities is the design of the probe capsule, which is almost identical in shape. The shape of the spacecraft are also fairly similar with the noticeable difference being that Rocket Lab's design places the solar panels on top of the craft, not the sides. Curious to know what other people think about this.

==========
Stage 1&2 success. 
==========
Quick Facts:

**Lift-off is scheduled for 0955 UTC from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 Pad B.**

Rocket Lab is launching: 
""Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment, also known as CAPSTONE.""


This pathfinding 55-pound CubeSat, will be the first spacecraft to test the Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) around
the Moon.

Researchers expect this orbit to be a gravitational
sweet spot in space ‚Äì where the pull of gravity from
Earth and the Moon interact to allow for a nearly stable orbit.

The orbit will bring CAPSTONE within 1,000 miles
of one lunar pole on its near pass and 43,500
miles from the other pole at its peak every seven
days, requiring less propulsion capability for
spacecraft flying to and from the Moon‚Äôs surface
than other circular orbits.

CAPSTONE is expected to orbit this area around
the Moon for at least six months to understand the
characteristics of the orbit. The NRHO
provides the advantage of an unobstructed view of
Earth in addition to coverage of the lunar South Pole.

These both have a ways to go before being realized and I have a hard time believing that Blue Origin can meet that price target but one thing they can do is subsidize the cost via Bezos and drive out most of the competition.

Moat chat,"First off this ain't a DD. This is a motivational wake up to what is actually happening. 


Every month that rocketlab is running, is the moat.


This ain't a 7/11 franchise. This is a business that has all the knowledge and engineering to get to space. Every day, every week, every month something new is learned that gives them an edged. All the layers beyond just a rocket, rocketlab already is refining and gaining new plans and partnerships.


All their previous launches, all that experience, gaining customers, a proven track record, refining, adapting, tweaking, integrating. Rocketlab building parts, building platforms, launching, monitoring, landing, building a process, refining a process.


The amount of experience, retaining customers, providing new experiences and solutions for customers...


...that is the moat. Doing the hard thing, doing it well, and most importantly already doing it. There isn't hopium, there isn't promises, they are already doing it.


Others haven't even scratched the surface of what that all entails. They don't have all the additional staff, processes, customers, solutions, platforms, they are stuck on figuring out step one. They are blowing millions, billions, without even a foundation of a business yet.


Rocketlab is so far ahead that they have a wild tech/intelligence/platform moat that is still far unrealized compared to their stock worth.


I am actually incredibly excited because a lot of this is still to be discovered by others. You really need to grasp how much rocketlab has already accomplished and how fast they are moving on neutron and space systems. Like, this ain't a shop that sells loaves of bread(nothing against a good sour dough, promise). They made a business that escapes the atmosphere, literally leaving the planet to find new opportunities. That is something once only held by the wealthiest and most knowledgable countries. Now we have it from rocketlab, where we individually have the ability, through its stock, to be a part of it. Literally nerd heaven.


Owning some rocketlab stock puts us right there in time, in the history of humanity where we are transitioning to space. Like imagine what you can tell your kids, nephews and neices or grand kids.


The wonderful thing is, you don't even have to imagine, you just do it, and you are a part of all this. Own a piece of this awesomeness. Help make sure it all happens, promote it, champion it. 


I just don't even know what else to say!!! It's so damn exciting.

Let's just imagine... what happens to Rocket Lab post-contact from Aliens?,"I know it is a taboo subject with a million different theories or beliefs. With all the congress hearings lately claiming UAPs are real, they are here, they hypothesize how they work within our understanding of physics but all agree the technology is not ours.

Let's just play pretend and all of that is 100% real and all of a sudden some alien race made contact and we got access to their gravitational propulsion technology, and are able to travel between our atmosphere, space, other planets, etc all very fast.

Does Rocket Lab just immediately become obsolete and tank? I suppose even if we don't need launch vehicles like rockets, the satellite components business would still be in full operation and working.

Or maybe it is a massive catalyst in humanity's drive for space and motivation to become interplanetary. All of a sudden rocket launches and satellites are #1, 2 and 3 priority and get massive attention and funding.

Where's the hop test vehicle?,"I am new to reddit but not new to NewSpace. I realize this is my first post and thus anticipate some downvotes.

I have a lingering thought. For Neutron reusability, where is the hop test vehicle? And if it is partially built, why has Rocket Lab not shared it's progress? Electron's 1st stage ability to come back to an area above the ocean via parachutes, to then be caught by a helicopter, was an interesting idea that never materialized. Bringing Neutron back to the Wallops pad, at a precise location, is much more challenging. And doing that landing on a floating barge is much more difficult. Why no word on the barge build?

The coming Neutron would be a fair competitor to Falcon 9, but what makes rocket lab different from others if Electron is their only operational rocket for now? Is it because most of the commercial satellites fall below the 300kg range so it‚Äôs more cost effective to launch with Electron?",10,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1fqsbtz/electron_payload/

Will rocket lab make weapons?,"So normally I don't care that much about morals generally and I am aware that companies like lockheed martin don't give a flying sh\* wether I buy a stock or not. Humans get bombed (or not bombed) regardless wether peasants like me buy a stock. I understand that it makes no difference, but still I don't think its moral to invest in stocks that build weapons. So I wanted to buy rocket lab stocks and I am wondering are they planning to make weapons in the near future? Or will they stick to peaceful space stuff?

Edit: With weapons I am specifically referring to bombs or other devices designed to activly hurt or kill people. I am not talking about missiles in general. Also I don't care about it if the rockets accidently crash and hurt the environment. The earth will certainly carry on without us. However I think its immoral to take away life, as in killing humans. Therefor (and thats just personal, not judging investors) I don't want to invest in stocks that build weapons (specifically bombs or WoMD designed to kill humans). Excluding explosives that are not used to harm humans (nuking an asteroid flying towards earth or exploding a mountain to mine diamonds). I just don't want my invested money used to actively hurt other people. However I don't care about espionage, cars and engines that hurts the environment or climate change or something like that. As I said my morals are not high. Its just that I draw the line at bombing people. I know its irrational, but thats just how I think.

Any chance for consideration?  Rejected due to short jobs(Aviation background).,"I had applied for Vehicle Integration and got scheduled for a phone interview.  When the date/time came, I didn't receive a call but about an hour later got a message that RocketLab decided to go with NZ/Aus residents for the position.  Yesterday, I get a email about another job I had applied for(Reaction Wheel) that got filled and was telling me to basically reapply.  I see that Vehicle Integration is still up there so I inquired on whether I should reapply for that too.  The response I got was most of my recent jobs were too short and the team decided to move on.

I never got a chance to interview to explain that those were contract jobs in the aviation field.  They said they were looking for people that had +3yrs at one place but the last 7 years I just worked in aviation(though worked at Sierra Space and Huntington-Ingalls in that time span too), I think most I spent at one place was 2 years but we ended up getting laid off a lot when the job was done.

I hope what I'm thinking doesn't happen,"I have a theory about why Blue Origin might finally cancel the launch of the Rocket Lab probes.

It was recently revealed that Blue Origin had applied for a license from the FAA to ship the Blue Moon MK1 in March 2025. (https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueOrigin/comments/1eqf17f/blue\_moon\_mk1\_pathfinder\_net\_march\_2025/)

A few days ago Bloomberg revealed that the hardware of the second and third New Glenn ship had been damaged in internal company tests, if the report is accurate, BO only has a single New Glenn ship tested and ready to fly, with the urgency of BO to demonstrate their lunar rover for missions to NASA while Starship is in development, they may have their internal interests as priority. (https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/08/21/bezos-blue-origin-suffers-fiery-setback-building-new-rocket/)

Let us remember that the probes that Rocket Lab has manufactured are launch class D, low-cost and these can be delayed, since they are not an urgent priority like classes A and B would be.

These are my thoughts, maybe I'm wrong and everything is ready for launch, but if Blue Origin decides in the end that they will not be able to meet the schedule for the window, it is possible that they are considering this path of prioritizing their lunar module since they are very profitable missions that NASA spends a lot of money

Downward revision for Q2 launches?,"Hey everyone.

Ahead of earnings I've been doing some research. I'm fairly ok with this quarter earnings meeting the targets of 98m assuming the space system forecast was accurate. Traditionally they've been pretty close so maybe +/- 1m but overall they've had all successful launches done.

My issue is for the upcoming quarter. Didn't they guide for like 6 launches this quarter? And more so for the entire year it was around 22/24. I really don't think this seems feasible right now. 

A possible downwards revision in launches in the guidance could be bearish news for this stock right? We could take a big hit that basis?

A delay/downwards revision in launches is either due to the fault of customers not having satellites ready to go or just a big lag between when Rocket lab get the electron rockets ready for launch.

The other side is the good news which could be them saying they'd be able to hit the target launches and possible news of neutron.",8,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1chca1w/downward_revision_for_q2_launches/

A Rocket Lab Name Change?,"Sure, Rocket Lab launches rockets, but the majority of its business (read: revenue, profits, contracts, attentions) is in space systems. As the business tilts further away from rockets, everybody from Peter Beck on down is talking about how the company's current name might be a bit misleading.

Should the name of the company be changed? If so, what are the considerations you would try to balance in a rebranding effort? For a company like Rocket Lab, which is increasingly pivoting to emphasize its space systems operations while still retaining its roots in rocket technology, what are some suggested names that strike the proper balance?",0,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1cg8lnp/a_rocket_lab_name_change/

I really hope Rocket Lab has some kind of ambition/plan for positioning itself to be a major player in the lunar economy.

Does Rocket Lab have a future with its space rockets?,"Many startups have emerged in this new boom in space exploration in the US, I think we are clear about who is the most influential in terms of rocket construction, SpaceX, Rocket Lab and Blue Origin.

But there is also a group of startups that are not interested in building rockets, because they are clear that they cannot compete with the main 3, so they are dedicating their efforts to trying to offer other services related to payload, saleslites, software, among others. . services that may arise, but we will not talk about them, we will focus on SpaceX, Blue Origin and Rocket Lab, which is what is expected of them in the coming years and this is where I want to make it clear that it is my perception that I will say to below and this may not happen as I will say.

To begin with, I think that SpaceX and Blue Origin have some points in common, not only does it have a strong backing of money, but its CEOs are people with certain power, who may have certain ties with politicians, this in some way . may influence certain future government contracts.

As for Rocket Lab, it is a company that comes from nowhere and is making its way with its own resources, this is where I want to remain skeptical, I don't know if Rocket is aware that it can be very difficult to compete directly with these 2 companies in the future, maybe I'm wrong, but I have the feeling that Rocket Lab will eventually focus on offering services like the other startups they mention at the beginning want to do and will slowly abandon rockets.

I want an Electron Launch using 3D / Spacial cameras,If you are reading this Rocket Lab tech employees and want to get a bunch of people excited to watch a launch (I watch them anyway since they are fun) put some live feed 3D / Spatial cameras on the pad or set up one to record a launch and then allow viewing of it.

I love what Rocket Lab is doing.  They are putting up satellites for lots of different companies from different countries.  Their work is having a large positive impact for employees in New Zealand and in the U.S.  They are walking the walk and not just talking the talk like a bunch of these other professed space companies.  It just irks me that as Beck is doing what needs to be done to be successful, the CEO of their biggest competitor met with a presidential candidate today who is asking for money.  You know if that happens there will be an understanding that SpaceX gets even more preferential treatment than anyone else.

Neutron‚Äôs Use of Carbon Fiber,"Can someone help me understand why carbon fiber is being used for Neutron and not Starship? Why is it more cost-effective for SpaceX to use stainless steel, but Rocket Lab determined carbon fiber would be more cost-effective for Neutron? 

In terms of durability, will carbon fiber still allow neutron to be reused a high number of times? I‚Äôm especially curious about reusability because of Rocket Lab‚Äôs goal of eventually having the capability to relaunch within 24 hours. 

Is it also possible Rocket Lab is becoming increasingly better equipped to manufacture carbon fiber materials, and they‚Äôre capitalizing on this more than SpaceX?",30,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1b8721b/neutrons_use_of_carbon_fiber/
Estimating Neutron first launch date based on publicly announced milestones,"Reposting with some updates to assumptions, from a different account for privacy reasons. Calculations haven't changed, and reference data is shown in the table at the bottom.

A little out of interest and mostly out of boredom, I decided to collate some public statements around Neutron development milestones to estimate the delay to Neutron's first launch date. For this, I collected statements from:

* Presentations available on Rocket Lab's investor relations page
* Archived versions of the Neutron page on the Rocket Lab website

This work could be expanded significantly by trawling through videos, interviews, etc as well (but not by me, this was already only mildly less boring than what I was avoiding doing). It is only a very simple analysis, with some large assumptions being made. Of course, these are only adjustments to public timelines and contain no inside knowledge of Rocket Lab's schedules or internal estimates.

Here's a chart of the results up front:

[Chart of Neutron first launch date estimates. The x-axis is the date that the statement of a milestone was made \(either Archimedes first hot fire or LC-3 readiness\).](https://preview.redd.it/gx0p4rpf4mmc1.png?width=3126&format=png&auto=webp&s=f13b2973239623152232b2c6b00da92ff294b353)

There are two different estimates based on two different approaches for each public statement date:

1. Simple Delay - assumes the amount of work after the milestone date remains the same as the original schedule, and adds the delay to the original launch date of 31 Dec 2024. This means that if Archimedes first hot fire is delayed by one year, the first launch date is delayed by one year.
2. Proportional Delay - this assumes that the effort estimates for the whole schedule are off by some factor, and applies that factor to the remaining activities as well. I.e., if it takes twice as long to reach Archimedes first hot fire from project start, it will also take twice as long to reach first launch from project start.

There are obviously a fair few assumptions going into this very basic analysis:

* Archimedes and LC-3 readiness are on the critical path to first launch. This means any delay to either of these is a delay to first launch. None of the calculated dates above assume a delay in both, only one or the other (and all but one is based on a delay in Archimedes).
* It does not account for any ""accelerations"" such as the company throwing significantly more people or money at the program, purchasing more components rather than building in house, etc. It also assumes that any planned ramp up in personnel is included in the original timeline and any other timelines shared publicly by the company.
* It assumes publicly announced dates were the best dates known to the company at the time, and takes them at face value on this.
* These two models for estimating delay are valid.
* When milestones were only listed as being completed in ""Q3"", the latest date in that quarter or month was assumed.
* When milestones were listed on the timeline on the Neutron page (only sorted by year, but in order), best guess was applied for delivery date to try and be most reasonable.
* It includes all delays - including from changing Archimedes architecture and having to redo a bunch of work there.

**What does this tell us?**

Neutron is probably delayed based on the assumptions made here, without a significant change in approach or spend - this analysis estimates to 2026 in all likelihood. This isn't a validated approach to estimating first launch of a new rocket, so you could dismiss it entirely if you want.

I personally think the first launch will be somewhere in between the Simple Delay and Proportional Delay (a bit closer to the Simple Delay) as the company will be trying to accelerate as much as they can to recover the timeline, and the Proportional Delay estimates are therefore extremely conservative. But at this scale, it only takes a few simple mistakes to significantly delay a program, so who knows.

**If you wanted to take this further**

I would recommend two next steps:

1. Add in more information sources (interviews, podcasts, videos, info from Electron launch livestreams, etc)
2. Perform the same analysis for other companies' first rockets that have actually launched to roughly assess the validity or accuracy of the method

Tl;dr - just look at the pretty graph

God forbid something catastrophic happens and they have a RUD on the first launch attempt, surely they should have at least another Neutron ""ready to go"" like SpaceX does with their Starships. Can anyone shed any light on whether my concerns are real or if they're planning building more Neutron rockets from the get go?",251,49,https://i.redd.it/c0l3c97tiplc1.jpeg

Space Services,"Peter Beck pointed out in this last earnings call that ultimately the greatest TAM, and therefore revenue, will be space services. The big question is which service segment will solidify Rocket Lab‚Äôs future. In a lot of ways, I like that Beck very deliberately left it open. It‚Äôs entirely possible the most revolutionary space service has yet to be realized, and Rocket Lab will be positioned to take full advantage of the opportunity by the time it comes into sight. Any ideas what space services will evolve with the same explosive growth that a lot of information technology did over the past 20 years?

Has anyone else been getting emails from ""Rocket Lab"" saying they have positions open and would like to conduct an interview with me. It seems fine at first but the more I look at the paperwork and such I am pretty sure it is a scam that someone is doing. So if someone see's it be careful I doubt that it is the real company. I can attach a screengrab of the email I have got a few times now. Then once you answer the email like an automated one sends again saying to contact them through teams and to continue with the interview through there. I am pretty positive this is a scam but I haven't talked with them other than sending the first email.

"LC-1A vs LC1-B, choice of launch pad in New Zealand","RocketLab's first 23 Electron launches were from LC-1A in New Zealand.

In 2022 they finished construction of a new pad, LC-1B, near the original and intended to increase launch frequency. 

The next 15 New Zealand launches in a row were from LC-1B. (And some from a third launchpad in America). 

Why is there such a strong preference for LC-1B? Is it better than LC-1A in some way? Is LC-1A undergoing upgrades currently? LC-1B was built five years later so might be a better pad and they've gone back to make the same changes to LC-1A?    
Or is the plan to ignore LC-1A and stick to LC-1B, improve launch frequency with a better pad rather than improving frequency by using two pads? I did wonder if they were modifying the pad ready for Neutron but that's a much larger rocket so they'd probably need to build a whole new pad rather than upgrading the oldest one.

So what's happening with LC-1A? Is LC-1B just better?",18,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1axcf1c/lc1a_vs_lc1b_choice_of_launch_pad_in_new_zealand/

Is Rocket Lab moving away from Matlab and towards Python in all jobs?,"Hi guys,

&#x200B;

I am thinking of going to uni this year and doing some ad-hoc courses in Python and data analysis to better prepare myself for some mechanical engineering roles in Rocket Lab. On many job listings, Python seems to be the sole requirement as far as data analysis goes.

&#x200B;

Does this indicate that Rocket Lab no longer is favouring Matlab and that I don't have to worry about taking Matlab courses to prepare myself better for some roles, such as in propulsion or thermofluids? Getting into one of these would be a dream!

Thanks in advance for all answers!

Sources indicate that the customer is likely the Space Development Agency.," 

SDA, an organization under the U.S. Space Force, is building a mesh[ network of military satellites](https://spacenews.com/space-development-agency-renames-constellation-to-reflect-focus-on-u-s-warfighter/?preview_id=140632&preview_nonce=0118ef1bb4&preview=true&_thumbnail_id=141872) in low Earth orbit known as the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.

SDA Director Derek Tournear speaking at a conference earlier this month said the agency was negotiating a contract with an unspecified supplier for 18 satellites to expand the U.S. military low Earth orbit constellation.

One of the portions of SDA‚Äôs proliferated architecture is the [Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta](https://spacenews.com/space-development-agencys-data-transport-satellites-get-more-complex/), made up of communications satellites to enable beyond line-of-sight connectivity for military forces on the ground.¬†

Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta is projected to have 90 satellites. The agency in August announced it awarded $1.5 billion in contracts to Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman for 72 Beta satellites.

Tournear said Dec. 7 at a National Security Space Association event that SDA was planning to add another 18 Beta satellites to the constellation and was in negotiations with another vendor that he did not disclose.

The Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta satellites ‚Äî projected to launch in 2026 and 2027 ‚Äî will carry radios using the UHF (Ultra High Frequency) and S-band frequencies that military and intelligence units rely upon for voice and low-speed data transmissions.

‚ÄúWe are looking at putting another approximately 18 satellites on contract, and we‚Äôre working with a third vendor to do that, and we should make that announcement shortly,‚Äù Tournear said Dec. 7 at the NSSA forum.¬†

According to Rocket Lab‚Äôs SEC filing, the contract includes a base amount of $489 million, with incentives and options worth $26 million. ‚ÄúWork under the agreement will begin immediately with the delivery of the space vehicles to the customer for launch slated for 2027, operation of the satellites through 2030, and an option to operate the satellites through 2033.‚Äù

Why is RocketLab the only launch provider with a Photon equivalent?,"Photon is a really cool addition to RocketLab's Electron rocket.

It blurs the lines between being a part of the payload and part of the launch vehicle, in a way it's both at once. From the customer's perspective it must be really useful to have Photon as an option when launching your payload. It can provide extra thrust to reach higher orbits than Electron alone, or it can provide the orbit circularisation burn at apogee, in both cases removing the need for the payload to handle those burns and keeping the final payload mass low. But it's also a communications bus to talk to Earth, has precision guidance systems and star tracking to assist in those final burns, further reducing payload complexity.

I was looking up Photon to make this post and I discovered they've made it even better than I already thought it was. The CAPSTONE mission to the moon last year used an upgraded Photon with an upgraded engine. They're marketing it as a full satellite bus with solar panels and radio antennae for missions to Mars or Venus. I thought it was just the kick-stage for the last little nudge to the correct orbit, I didn't realise it was so capable.

Which feeds more into my question, why doesn't anyone else have a Photon equivalent?

RocketLab's website describes Photon as being ""Vertically integrated with in-house subsystems based on constellation-scale manufacturing capabilities"". Yeah, it's made by people who routinely make and launch rockets, uses known parts and subsystems with known behaviours and capabilities. It just makes sense that the rocket manufacturer can make a really effective satellite bus, especially for customers where this might be their first satellite. I wonder if the customer base of smallsat providers / first launches is why this is relevant for RocketLab but not SpaceX. In theory SpaceX make a bigger and better kickstage/satellite-bus with Draco/Superdraco engines and help people launch more capable satellites. But Falcon 9 is so much bigger that their customers are usually larger and more capable of managing their own payloads. Electron is so much smaller and more of their customers are smallsats / first ever launches and they need to lean more heavily on the launch provider.

It may also be that Falcon 9's second stage has excess capacity compared to Electron's second stage. Apart from Starlink launches very few Falcon 9 launches come within 20% of the max payload capacity so they just use the second stage for circularisation burns or finessing the orbital insertion. Electron can't do that because it's so close to the mass limits and it's more efficient to ditch the second stage mass and use a smaller kickstage for circularisation burns.

But I'm just guessing blind really. I'd like to see SpaceX develop a Photon equivalent for Falcon 9. Or someone else, maybe Stoke or Relativity Space or ISRO.",35,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/176zsgg/why_is_rocketlab_the_only_launch_provider_with_a/

**Reused Rutherford Engine Successfully Flies on 40th Mission!** 

You   read that right! On August 24 (NZST), we successfully launched our  40th  Electron mission, called ‚ÄúWe Love the Nightlife,‚Äù for Capella  Space.  Not only did we deliver Capella‚Äôs satellite to orbit, but we  also  demonstrated some significant milestones in evolving Electron into  a  reusable rocket.¬†

For  the  first time, we reused a Rutherford engine that had previously flown  on  our ‚ÄúThere And Back Again‚Äù mission in May 2022. The engine worked   flawlessly on its second flight as it took Electron to space. Then the   first stage returned to Earth with a successful ocean splashdown in the   Pacific Ocean.¬†

Hot on the heels  of ‚ÄúWe Love the Nightlife,‚Äù we‚Äôre launching another  dedicated Electron  launch for Capella. The ‚ÄòWe Will Never Desert You‚Äô  mission is scheduled  for lift-off from Launch Complex 1 as soon as 19  September. The  mission will be our third launch for Capella this year ‚Äì  we're on a  roll! ¬†

* [Four new HASTE missions](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=dd817b0cc7&e=56a66a2a9a) for Leidos under the MACH-TB program, scheduled to launch from LC-2 across 2024 and 2025. ¬†
* BlackSky,   a leading provider of real-time geospatial intelligence and global   monitoring services, which has launched on six Electron missions since   2019, [signed a block buy deal for five Electron launches](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=85cc888a2e&e=56a66a2a9a)   for their Gen-3 satellites beginning in 2024. Fun fact: BlackSky has   used Electron as a launch vehicle more than any other single commercial   customer!¬†¬†
* A new, double-launch deal with NASA to deliver their climate change research-focused mission, [PREFIRE](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=45378f0d66&e=56a66a2a9a),   is now scheduled to launch in May 2024. NASA's PREFIRE (Polar Radiant   Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment) mission will help close a gap in   understanding of how much of Earth‚Äôs heat is lost to space, especially   from the Arctic and Antarctica. This will be our 7th and 8th mission  for  NASA since 2018. (Graphic we made of 2 launches)¬†¬†
* Last but not least, [we signed a deal with Japanese Earth imaging company Synspective ](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=8e1595f672&e=56a66a2a9a)to   launch two dedicated Electron missions. Rocket Lab has been launching   for Synspective since 2020 when the Company deployed the first  satellite  in Synspective‚Äôs synthetic aperture radar (SAR)  constellation. Since  that first mission, Rocket Lab has been the sole  launch provider for  Synspective‚Äôs StriX constellation to date,  successfully deploying three  StriX satellites across three dedicated  Electron launches¬†

Rocket Lab Wins Industry of the Year Award for Stennis Location

Rocket Lab received the prestigious [Industry of the Year Award](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=42323fcd30&e=56a66a2a9a)   at the Hancock Chamber Business & Industry Awards Gala in August.   The annual awards recognize outstanding achievements in citizenship,   industry and business in Hancock County, Mississippi. ¬†  
We opened our  facility at the Stennis Space Center in 2022 and the site  will be used  to test the new Archimedes engines for the Neutron rocket  coming in  2024.¬†

When   we expanded our Space Systems division, we created a vertical   integration strategy where we could build essential elements of a   spacecraft for our own satellites and those built by others. The idea   behind this was everything going to space should have a Rocket Lab logo   on it!¬†

Speaking of‚Ä¶¬†                                      **NASA Psyche Mission** 

NASA‚Äôs  Psyche mission, which will orbit a metal-rich asteroid of the  same  name in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, is  scheduled  to launch in less than 30 days on 5 October 2023! ¬†

The spacecraft will use a huge Rocket Lab solar array that will power the spacecraft during its 4-billion-kilometer journey.¬†

**MethaneSAT Mission** 

MethaneSAT,  scheduled to launch no earlier than January 2024, is an  Earth  observation satellite that will monitor and study global methane   emissions to combat climate change. We are providing multiple elements   to make this mission a success including developing the Mission   Operation Center, the solar panels to power the spacecraft, and the   separation system that will eject the satellite to its orbit. This   mission is jointly funded and operated by the Environmental Defense   Fund, an American NGO, and the New Zealand Space Agency ‚Äì the country‚Äôs   first space science mission! ¬†

**Neutron Update**

Neutron,   our mega constellation launcher, continues its development on  schedule.  We‚Äôve now begun Stage 2 tank testing including cryogenic fill  and  pressure cycles to determine structural and sealing integrity and   performance, hydrostat test to prove the structural integrity of the   structure, domes, and hatches, and the fill, press, vent and de-tank   systems and procedures among other structural tests.

Thoughts on Ashlee Vance's new book?,"I just finished When the Heavens Went on Sale, Ashlee Vance's new book detailing Planet Labs, Rocket Lab, Astra, and Firefly. I read Vance's book on Musk when it came out and learned a lot from it. This new book had some really great history and details, and gives us a very inside view of the founding of these exciting companies. However, I must say it was relatively unbalanced. The section on Rocket Lab was short and sweet, and tried to include some negatives/controversies where there weren't really any. The other sections were rife with massive issues with the founders, conflicts, etc. I was honestly looking to learn about companies besides Rocket Lab so I could diversify my position in the space economy, but after reading I just want to hold RKLB more because the others have so many issues. The sections on Astra and Firefly seemed so hopeful, but blatantly ignored the reality that Rocket Lab has worked up a regular cadence with a flight proven vehicle while they are still floundering around.

I did learn some new stuff about Rocket Lab, like how the first electron launch when flawlessly and it was actually a US government software issue that caused them to terminate. What a shame. However, the section on Astra seemed really drawn out when it was effectively chapter after chapter of ""they tried to launch a rocket, it was delayed/blew up"" and especially knowing that they never got Rocket 3 to work and won't launch another rocket until 2025, when they're out of cash.

I think the main takeaway for me was how the US government has really muddled the space industry by overreaching. E.g. everyone at NASA having 0 vision besides Pete Worden, multiple agencies cockblocking Max Polyakov for being Ukrainian, and the restrictions on Rocket Lab's development given that most of it happens in New Zealand. 

I wanted to see what you all thought of the book, if you had different impressions, and just get a conversation going around it. While the book should get some more people looking at Rocket Lab, I think it really underplays their accomplishments while trying to inflate the progress of the competition.",19,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1526awp/thoughts_on_ashlee_vances_new_book/

# Introduction

With the 2024 first launch of the Rocket Lab Mega Constellation Launcher‚ÄîThe Neutron‚Äîfast approaching, I decided it is high time for a more up-to-date DD on Rocket Lab. A lot is happening in the industry, the company, and the world. I have decided to dive into the future, fundamentals, industry, funding, financials, dreams, and of course, the memes of the aspiring space company. Now, I am posting my DD into both of the Rocket Lab subreddit, as I am new to writing DD and I want to hit as wide of an audience as I can. One disclaimer (for those who do not like stock talk), this DD is not meant to encourage buying of the stock, nor is it financial advice or a stock-only DD, I merely want to dive into this company and simply spark some discussion on it!

Now, Rocket Lab is a private aerospace manufacturer and small satellite launch service provider. The company was founded in 2006 by Peter Beck and is headquartered in Long Beach, California, with additional facilities in New Zealand and Australia. Rocket Lab specializes in the development and launch of small rockets capable of delivering payloads of up to 300 kilograms to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab‚Äîself-designated as a leader in launch and space systems‚Äîis a company that has a chance at becoming a highly profitable giant over the next decade and beyond. In my honest opinion, Rocket Lab currently thrives off of the crumbs of the current space industry ecosystem. With Space X increasingly focused upon one goal‚Äîthanks to their controversial, yet nevertheless, fearless leader‚Äîbeing Mars, Rocket Labs can (and in my opinion will) become one of the go-to space companies for low earth orbit launches in the near term and in the long-term become one of the go-to space company for launches between the Moon, Venus, and Mars as well. Rocket Lab currently lives off of the crumbs left behind by NASA, Space X, and the United States military-industrial complex.

[  Like these two legends from the movie War Dogs, Rocket Lab is determined to become the go-to space company for transporting all types of goods into orbit. For those of you who have not seen the movie \(I personally highly recommend it\), essentially, when these two start their arms-dealing company, they focus upon all of the small contracts that the government is putting out for arms supplies. The contracts that the big players are ignoring, due to their small sizes, even so, these small contracts are worth hundreds of thousands to low millions. Now, this is where Rocket Lab currently lies in the industry.](https://preview.redd.it/j6wloa05vd4b1.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fc5120309359cb8789b861e68009133ef92d376)

[ \\""A new space race has begun, and most Americans are not even aware of it. This race is not \[about\] political prestige or military power. This new race involves the whole human species in a contest against time.\\"" - Ben Bova ](https://preview.redd.it/iliovpg7vd4b1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=f22e8c01f45a403829c6c681966f1a9a53fab213)

Now, before I dive into everything here, I need every to understand that this industry is on the verge of immense change and rapid evolution. We are currently in the first stage of the world‚Äôs Second Space Race. As a student of History, I can confidently tell you that there are murmurings within the historical community, that this is the case, beginning with the creation and success of Space X‚Äôs first reusable rocket: the Falcon 9. On December 21st of 2015, when the first Falcon 9 was launched and the landing was successful with the first stage fully recovered, the race began. In the same way that there is no single company above all others in the airline, shipping & transportation, or car manufacturing industries, is the same reason I do not believe that Space X will alone run the space industry‚Äôs transportation needs. There is plenty of room for companies like Rocket Lab to fill the gaps Space X cannot and in a decade‚Äôs time, there will be plenty of room for even more companies. Yet, there are no companies that are even close to competing with Space X‚Äîother than Rocket Lab‚Äîat this time. Now, I won‚Äôt go deeply into most of these competitors in this deep dive, but to be short, Astra is on the verge of total failure, Virgin Galactic has been playing an entirely different game‚Äîspace tourism, which there is a massive market for, just perhaps won‚Äôt be penetrated by them‚Äîthey likewise seem to be failing. While Blue Origin has been playing a strong game and Space X an even stronger one, albeit more and more focused solely on Mars as the years go on.

[ Here you can see the 1-year charts of Rocket Lab, Astra, Virgin, and Boeing for reference, as you can see, these charts speak volumes. Rocket Lab has been having a tough year but has found a nice bottom and is consistently bouncing from lows in the $3.6-4 range. While Astra has been reduced to a penny stock, with their future unknown. Virgin Galactic is only maintaining below Rocket Lab‚Äôs share price, partly due to the large number of Retail investors that do not know much and refuse to let it die, coupled with a small hope that the company can recover in the coming years. Boeing is here for reference as to what a successful, large-cap company involved in a similar industry \(and the space industry as well\), should look like over the course of a decent year. ](https://preview.redd.it/4lgxhawavd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d24878b2d7dc72b1e5c87ccd01d67c077485001a)

*Now, there are a few assumptions that I am making that we need to cover before diving into the real DD:* Whether it be because we live in the beginnings of a second Space Race (fueled by privatized space companies and the world‚Äôs governments) or because of technological advancement and a rising interest in space, the increase in rocket launches, space development (in Earth‚Äôs orbit, the Moon, and Mars), and the lowering costs of space launches‚Ä¶ it will become exponentially cheaper, easier, and faster to launch into orbit and the industry as a whole will have a massive boom‚Äîakin, in a way, to the industrial revolution‚Äîover the mid-to-late 2020s into the early 2030s. With the mid-to-end 2030s and early 2040s, we will see massive developments in terms of low-Earth orbit manufacturing facilities, tourist destinations, and stations, as well as settlements on the Moon for mining and refueling for greater exploration and colonization of the Sol System as a whole.

Now these are in part assumptions, but I think once one does the research and looks at the fact, all of this is very achievable. Even if it does not occur in this way, you can shift the dates by an additional decade and every time you do, the more likely, easier, and cheaper it all becomes.

Rocket Lab's business model revolves around providing cost-effective and frequent access to space for small satellite operators. The company aims to simplify the process of deploying satellites by offering dedicated launches on its Electron rocket. Rocket Lab operates as an end-to-end service provider, handling the entire launch process from mission planning and payload integration to launch and on-orbit operations.

# Section 1: Rocket Lab Takes Flight! The Electron & the Neutron

[  ‚ÄòRocket Lab is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, complete spacecraft design and manufacturing, satellite components, flight software, and an on-orbit management.‚Äô ‚Äì Rocket Labs](https://preview.redd.it/nbt3cd8dvd4b1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc518b0149113dc115f082394c2b6e8b33e36707)

Rocket Lab's primary launch vehicle, the Electron, is a two-stage rocket powered by Rutherford engines, which use electric-pump-fed LOX/RP-1 propellants. The Electron is designed to optimize cost, flexibility, and rapid launch capability for small satellites. Rocket Lab has demonstrated numerous successful launches since its inaugural flight in 2017, showcasing its technological prowess and reliability. The small satellite market has been growing rapidly, driven by increased demand for data collection, communications, and Earth observation. Rocket Lab's focus on dedicated launches for small satellites positions it well to capture a significant portion of this expanding market. The company has already established a solid customer base, securing contracts with government agencies, research institutions, and commercial entities.

Rocket Labs‚Äîat the time of writing this‚Äîhas had 37 launches‚Äîwith a 91.89% success rate‚Äîdeployed 164 satellites, operates 3 launch pads, and is maintaining 3 Photon Satellites in the Earth‚Äôs orbit. Of the 164 satellites launched by Rocket Labs, they were commissioned to do so by a wide variety of clients, from NASA, Space Force, DARPA, to Canon. Rocket Labs is supported by Future Fund: Australia‚Äôs Sovereign Wealth Fund, Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Data Collective, Greenspring Associates, ACC, Promus Ventures, L One W One Ltd., and Lockheed Martin.

Rocket Lab‚Äôs main rocket, the Electron‚Äîbuilt and operated by Rocket Lab‚Äîhas flown 37 times and been successful 34 times, with only 3 failures. Rocket Lab‚Äôs key areas of business penetration lie in the launch of mid-sized service rockets, the manufacturing of space systems and satellites, and their adept ability to manufacture industrial space parts, applications, and proponents. The latter of which, they are sort of unopposed in terms of competition.

The Neutron‚ÄîRocket Lab‚Äôs medium-lift, mega constellation launcher‚Äîwill be able to launch 13,000 kilograms into low Earth orbit and it will be ‚Ä¶drum roll please‚Ä¶ reusable! The current goal is for it to launch in 2024. It will be designed for not only low earth orbital supply missions, but also deep space missions, and even human spaceflight. It will be fairing a design allowing for full reusability of the first stage and it will be lightweight, being made of Rock Lab‚Äôs own carbon composite structure. The home base for the Neutron will be at the Neutron Production Complex and the launch pad at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility and Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.

[ ‚ÄòThe Neutron Production Complex will be home to a rocket production, assembly, and integration facility, as well as a dedicated launch pad for the Neutron rocket located on the southern end of Wallops Island. The estimated 250,000 square foot state-of-the-art complex will be constructed on a 28-acre site adjacent to the Wallops Island Flight Facility and will include a Launch Control Center, Rocket Lab‚Äôs fifth global operations center for launch activities and on-orbit operations. To support rapid production of the Neutron rocket, current plans for the complex include automated fiber placement robotic production systems capable of laying up meters of Neutron‚Äôs new, specially formulated carbon composite structures in minutes. As a reusable rocket, Neutron is designed to land back on the Launch Complex 3 pad after a mission and from there it would be returned to the production complex for refurbishment and re-flight.‚Äô ](https://preview.redd.it/k592skwfvd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=279742c6d6196d860258d747af98f84e71b71470)

With Space X dominating large-load space orbital flight and transportation, Rocket Labs, in my honest opinion, is where Space X was roughly something like 6-8 years ago. While Rocket Lab intends to compete with Space X‚Äîwhether it will be considered competition in an industry this brand new and small, time will tell‚Äîfor cargo and humans to the low Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and even Venus! Space X and Elon Musk have made it abundantly clear that the goal of Space X is the large-scale settlement of Mars. While later models of Rocket Lab‚Äôs Neutron will be able to go to Mars and Venus, it appears that is not their main goal. In the near term (being the next two decades), they will be looking to dominate the low Earth orbit and Moon market as well as the manufacturing of industrial space parts, applications, and proponents.

# Section 2: The Space Industry & Company Fundamentals

Rocket Lab faces competition from other commercial launch providers, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. However, the company differentiates itself by specializing in small satellite launches, offering a tailored solution for this niche market. Rocket Lab's Electron rocket provides the advantage of dedicated launches and the flexibility to reach specific orbits, making it an attractive option for small satellite operators.

Rocket Lab has raised significant funding through various investment rounds, securing capital from venture capital firms, strategic partners, and government entities. Notable investors include Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Lockheed Martin. The company's ability to attract substantial investment indicates confidence in its business model and growth potential. Rocket Lab operates within the regulatory framework of the countries in which it launches its rockets. The company holds necessary licenses and approvals from government agencies, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Compliance with safety regulations and adherence to environmental guidelines are crucial aspects of Rocket Lab's operations.

Despite its achievements, Rocket Lab faces several risks and challenges. The space industry is highly competitive, and the success of the company depends on its ability to secure launch contracts and maintain a steady launch cadence. Regulatory changes, launch failures, or delays could impact Rocket Lab's operations and reputation. Additionally, the emergence of new technologies or market disruptors could pose a threat to the company's market position

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room, the Quarterly Results. To preface, negative quarterly results mean‚Äîpardon my French‚Äîjack-shit (at least in the short term) for a company such as Rocket Lab, that is looking at penetrating a market such as the space industry. We are going to look at the past four Quarterly Results in chronological order.

**Q2 2022 Report:** Rocket Lab achieved record revenue of $55.5 million, showing significant growth compared to the previous quarter (36% sequential growth) and the same quarter in the previous year (392% YoY growth). Despite the revenue growth, the company reported a negative EPS of $-0.08, indicating a net loss for the quarter.

**Q3 2022 Report:** Another record revenue was achieved, reaching $63.1 million, with a sequential growth of 14% and an impressive YoY growth of 1,093%. The company's EPS improved slightly to $-0.07 but still remained negative. The fourth quarter revenue is expected to be lower, ranging between $51 million and $54 million, as a launch customer's push extends into 2023.

**Q4 2022 Report:** The company's revenue for Q4 reached $51.8 million, showing a healthy year-over-year growth of 88%. The full-year revenue for fiscal 2022 amounted to $211 million, reflecting substantial growth of 239% compared to the previous year. The EPS remained negative at $-0.08.

**Q1 2023 Report:** The revenue for Q1 2023 was $54.9 million. Increasing revenue by 35% in the first quarter of 2023. Revenue from their launch business was $19.6 million, up $12 million from the prior quarter. Their EPS was $-0.08, indicating strong maintenance of their business. The second quarter is expected to show a significant revenue increase, with an estimated range of $60 million to $63 million.

Now, what does this all tell us? Firstly, they were very forthcoming with the quarterly expectations. Something one might think is not a big deal, but considering how a lot of publicly traded companies operate, this is a good thing. In each of their earnings reports, they have nearly exactly estimated their results, showing they are not attempting to mislead investors. The company has experienced impressive revenue growth throughout the reported quarters, indicating strong market performance and demand for its products/services. However, the negative EPS values suggest that the company is still operating at a net loss. From a shareholder‚Äôs perspective, the company's focus should be on achieving profitability and reducing the negative EPS, while maintaining consistent revenue growth. In my opinion, this stock is sitting just below a fair market value for what it is right now, sitting at just over $4, considering they are not fully profitable. Yet Rocket Lab continues to grow its business, making more contracts, and it stands a competitive chance. If they can turn a profit within 2-3 years, I think they will be one hell of a company. With their competitors failing left and right and none finding the success as Rocket Lab‚Äîother than Space X‚Äîthey could stand to be a massive company in a few decades, so massive, they‚Äôre bigger than Earth.

One last financial point to touch upon‚Ä¶ shorting, so here is some data, which is roughly one month outdated due to my difficulty in finding up-to-date information on the company without a Bloomberg Terminal (So, if anyone on the sub has access to a Bloomberg Terminal and would like to add to my DD in the comments, please do).

**Last Record Date:** May 15, 2023

**Outstanding Shares:** 478,660,000 shares

**Float Size:** 262,310,000 shares

**Short Percent of Float:** 9.80% (The short percent of float represents the percentage of shares available for trading that have been sold short).

**Average Trading Volume:** 4,044,396 shares

**Current Short Volume:** 25,710,000 shares

**Previous Short Volume:** 24,630,000 shares

**Change Vs. Previous Month**: +4.38%

**Dollar Volume Sold Short:** $111.58 million

**Short Interest Ratio / Days to Cover:** 7.7 (This ratio indicates the number of days it would take for the short sellers to cover their positions based on the average daily trading volume.).

The short interest in Rocket Lab has increased from the previous month, with a change of +4.38%. The short percent of the float is 9.80%, indicating that a significant portion of the available shares for trading has been sold short. Now, Rocket Lab‚Äôs short interest is relatively low for a company that has had consistent negative EPS and revenue. Showcasing that the big players in markets either A) believe this company will make a massive turnaround in the near future (1-3 years mark) or B) Rocket Lab, due to its size, is thankfully not on their radar. However, that said, the off-exchange short percentage is 57.69%, showcasing that A) public on-exchange short volume is a complete hoax and Hedge Funds, and other big players are beating down on the stock or B) all of this information is completely misrepresented to retail traders on purpose and the entirety of the United States market system is a complete farce.

# Section 3: Future Prospects & Big Moves

Rocket Lab has demonstrated strong performance and growth potential in the emerging small satellite launch market. The company continues to refine its launch processes, aiming to increase launch frequency and reduce costs further. Additionally, Rocket Lab has plans to develop a larger reusable rocket called Neutron, targeting the medium-lift market segment, which would expand its capabilities and market reach. The company has the potential to be the go-to company for low Earth orbital launches in the short term and in the long term, one of, if not the go-to company, for transportation to the Moon, Mars, and Venus.

[  Peter Beck, founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, did an interview last month on his take on the industry and their future prospects. I wanted to touch briefly on this \(you can find the video on YouTube\).](https://preview.redd.it/ced7t9iivd4b1.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=6579fcd100b405f44d1e65fb13cb185cefe6ed76)

Firstly, the video begins with the commentator stating, ""*With the Space Race this week*,"" the Space X rocket, the most powerful ever built, has scrubbed its launch. While Rocket Lab is adding a new service for testing hypersonic sub-orbital launches, being a welcome addition to the company‚Äôs wide array of services. Beck states that it is a very exciting time, stating that ‚Äú*the United States is kind of lacking behind in hypersonic technologies and this is a great opportunity to have high cadence, test flight environment for these payloads to really move forward the US‚Äôs hypersonic research*.‚Äù He goes on to talk about how these capabilities are essentially repurposed from Rocket Lab‚Äôs Electron Rocket capabilities: ‚Äú*We take a standard Electron orbital-class launch vehicle and we fly it in some really unique trajectories to provide these hypersonic trajectories‚Ä¶ it is taking an Electron and making a couple wee tweaks to it and having a great high frequency hypersonic testing platform that hasn‚Äôt existed*.‚Äù Beck goes on to speak on the launch cadence ‚Äú*being on target for 15 flights*‚Äù this year with the fastest turn around this year being 7 days between flights, saying ‚Äú*the machine is cranking and the vehicles are flying successfully and the last flight was a reusable vehicle and we splashed that down successfully and now we‚Äôre kind at the point where we are recycling and harvesting engines and components off of those launch vehicles and getting ready to put them back into service and re-fly them*.‚Äù He continues, stating, ‚Äú*I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm allowed to say exactly, but‚Ä¶ a whole multiple gambit of reused components that are all now re-entering the production line and going back into service*.‚Äù Morgan Brennan, the interviewer then speaks to how there is this emerging mismatch between supply and demand when it comes to the satellite launch market, with the fact that there are so many satellite constellations that are poised to go into orbit in the coming years and not enough capacity in terms of launching them. So, she then asks about the reusability of Electron and the development of the Neutron. Beck states that, ‚Äú*Electron is really serving that market very well, and there are lots of flight opportunities that are sort of just doing its thing, Neutron is the new flight opportunity for us‚Ä¶ 2026 to 2030 timeframe there is a massive deficit in launch and there are lots of constellations that are all really vying for an ability to get in orbit, so we saw that coming and started work on the vehicle and hopefully we can bring it into service in 2024 and really solve some of those problems and take advantage of that market opportunity*.‚Äù

Now, I don‚Äôt have to tell you all that this is very good to hear from Beck and this is very exciting, showcasing that he really believes Rocket Lab can penetrate this market and become a big player in the ever-evolving industry.

**Rocket Lab Making Big Moves Lately:**

¬∑ Bought Virgin Orbit HQ in California, this was a big win for the company, and folk on the sub were very excited to see this happen. Yay! But, sad and unfortunate for Virgin Galactic, which I am sure many of us space enthusiasts had higher hopes for, oh well, not everyone can achieve their dreams.

¬∑ Rocket Lab reached a new Company record of nine launches within a calendar year.

¬∑ Achieved a record of 100% mission success for Electron launches for the year.

¬∑ Successfully launched CAPSTONE mission to the Moon for NASA, including the first demonstration of Lunar Photon spacecraft platform.

¬∑ Achieved programmatic milestones for the Company‚Äôs two Photon spacecraft to support NASA‚Äôs ESCAPADE mission to Mars, and for the Photon spacecraft for a Varda Space Industries‚Äô mission to manufacture high-value products in zero gravity. Both Photon programs include Rocket Lab star trackers, reaction wheels, solar panels, flight software, and radios ‚Äì demonstrating the value and strength of the Company‚Äôs vertical integration and in-house supply chain.

# Conclusion: An Ode to Humanity's Future

Rocket Lab has established itself as a leading player in the small satellite launch market, offering dedicated launch services tailored to the needs of small satellite operators. The company's technological capabilities, solid customer base, and innovative approach position it well for future growth.

Those who lived and grew up in the 1960s and 1970s believed that by the 21st century, mankind would be a space-faring civilization. People had a fascination with the unknown. It was embedded in pop culture, in movies like the 2001 Space Odyssey, Alien, and the Star Trek series. But the unfortunate truth is that after Apollo 17 on the 19th of December 1972, mankind has not left low-earth orbit. The American public lost interest, the government cut funding, and the Saturn V rockets were dismantled and replaced by space shuttles in the 1980s (spaceships not even built to leave low-earth orbit). The curiosity and desire to unravel the mystery of the universe are now again filling the hearts of people. Technology is becoming more advanced and cheaper.

With companies like Rocket Lab and Space X, the future is looking bright. We currently live in an era of mass information. One of the hardest aspects of life in the early-21st-century is learning how to filter all this information. The news of the accomplishments of Rocket Lab, Space X, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA), the European Space Agency (ESA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Space Force, are lost in the large volume of collective data. The average person does not believe how close we are to colonizing Luna and Mars; how close we are to becoming a multi-planetary species. If you walked up to someone on the street of New York City, today, and told them that in the mid-2040s, and by the latest, the 2050s, there will be hundreds if not thousands of people living in Earth's orbit, the upper atmosphere of Venus, the Moon, and Mars, the person would dismiss you in disbelief. But the same would have happened if you walked up to a person on the street of New York City on the 19th of July 1962 (before Kennedy‚Äôs speech) and told them that mankind would step foot on the moon in seven years. Companies like Rocket Lab, which will make orbital flight and transportation affordable, will allow for a new era of civilization, one which was only present and dreamed of in science fiction of the past.

[The Earth, as imaged from the Voyager 1 spacecraft, was suspended in a sunbeam, as the interstellar craft exited the Sol system in 1990. Earth is nearly 4 billion miles away in this image. That is us. That is humanity, all of us that have thus far, ever existed. We take to the stars in search of not only answers but in search of a purpose.](https://preview.redd.it/hnr23odlvd4b1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=298a1ee80b0bc5e3dc0ba5c3c61aa6a25c0682c1)

Rocket Lab to launch 2 missions for NASA hurricane-watching constellation,,121,9,https://www.space.com/rocket-lab-launch-nasa-tropics-hurricane-watching-satellites
Neutron launching Kuiper Satellites for Amazon?,"Hi All,

I was thinking, what are the chances for Amazon awarding launch contract to RocketLab Neutron for its Kuiper Satellites?

RocketLab is already going to deliver reaction wheels (2-3K a year) for Kuiper. RocketLab also recently launched a high-volume star tracker (maybe also for Kuiper). All in all, seems like RocketLab is going to do a lot of work for Kuiper. Then why not launch also?

Amazon did sign launch contracts with Vulcan Centaur (ULA), New Glenn (BO) and Ariane 6 (ArianeSpace). All these medium to heavy lift launch vehicles are delayed and won't see a multiple launch cadence before 2025/2026. It is even questionable whether ULA and ArianeSpace can achieve a high launch cadence as their vehicles are expendable.

Amazon Kuiper is in a hurry to catch up with starlink, so they do not really have the luxury to wait. Therefore, I think there a good chances that RocketLab will get launch contracts from Amazon Kuiper. Neutron could potentially launch 4 or more times in 2025 and then scale rapidly from there i.e. providing Amazon Kuiper with better performance than all of the current launch contract holders.

A Neutron rocket could put roughly 18 Kuiper satellites (700kg per satellite) in orbit per launch at a price of $50 million. $ per kg will definitely be lower than with Vulcan Centaur and Ariane 6.

Speculation on the long-term evolution of commercial launch in this decade (with an eye towards heavy lift as well as Relativity Space),"Hey all,

Just thought I'd put this out there as purely hypothetical (borderline tinfoil) speculation on what could happen in the years to come as the commercial launch market continues to evolve.

First off, a fun thought exercise - what would you name a potential heavy-lift launch vehicle that Rocket Lab could develop after Neutron?

Peter Beck has mentioned recently that they have no plans on retreading the rocket development path, but if SpaceX manages to get the Starship system operational this decade and it disrupts the industry like everyone thinks it will, Rocket Lab may be forced to adapt once again.

In that case, after looking at a variety of options, I personally like Hadron^1 the most. It already has name recognition thanks to CERN's Large Hadron Collider. Additionally, the neutron itself is a member of the hadron class of subatomic particles.

So, not only would Hadron be a logical progression from a particle physics perspective, it would also have instant name recognition. Just imagine: ""Rocket Lab's Hadron Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle"" - rolls off the tongue rather nicely eh?

Second, I got to thinking about consolidation in the commercial launch sector moving forward, as an economic downturn looms and we exit the near-zero interest rate environment that led to the previous decade's boom in launch startups. Many executives in the industry ([including Beck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qcHd13G6yQ)) have made public statements about this in the past couple of years.

Other small launch newcomers already have strong ties to large defense primes that may suggest acquisition down the line (e.g. Lockheed Martin with ABL and Northrop Grumman with Firefly)

The only two remaining non-""billionaire funded"" U.S. commercial LV players with significant financial runways are Rocket Lab and Relativity Space.

I've read previous threads on this sub discussing Relativity and the sentiment seems to be that despite the fact that they've yet to launch, they are a competitor worth paying attention to due to significant private investor interest, high quality talent (mostly ex-SpaceX), and potentially game-changing proprietary tech.

Once again, if Starship proves to work as advertised, and/or macroeconomic conditions continue to deteriorate, market participants may be forced to consolidate in order to survive. Precedent is currently being set in the satellite operator space as multi-billion dollar players have begun M&A processes under growing pressure from Starlink (e.g. Oneweb / Eutelsat and Viasat / Inmarsat). While less common, we've also previously seen consolidation in the launch industry, with Lockheed + Boeing's ULA JV, Airbus + Safran's ArianeGroup JV, and Orbital + ATK's merger. Aerojet Rocketdyne's recent tie-ups with Northrop and L3Harris also come to mind. Granted, each of these cases is unique, but anything is possible in this space, regardless of how large or established a company is.

Thus, I see no inherent reason why a Rocket Lab + Relativity merger couldn't be possible down the line, assuming both companies continue to grow and execute at pace. (A major assumption, to be sure!)

I realize this is probably the last thing on either company's mind at the moment but hear me out. Below is a big picture list of observations on both companies, with an emphasis on their similarities and potential synergies:

- Co-location at NASA Stennis for both companies' next-generation reusable methalox engine testing: Both Aeon R and Archimedes test complexes will be located fairly close to each other at Stennis. I wouldn't be surprised to see some degree of cross-pollination between the construction, engineering, and technician staff across both programs
- Both companies are vocal champions of additive manufacturing techniques throughout major components of LV production
- Both companies' headquarters are located just 3 miles away from each other in Long Beach
- Rocket Lab has proven to be a pragmatic, execution-rich organization. Relativity has proven to be a forward-looking, ambition-rich organization. Combining these modalities could in theory lead to an organization greater than the sum of its parts - SpaceX, the current market leader, has both of these elements in spades
- With Neutron, Rocket Lab is optimizing for operational efficiency with partial reusability and RTLS as their north star, whereas with Terran-R, Relativity is leaning on highly novel structures with full reusability as their north star. If Relativity manages to crack the full reusability problem at sub-Starship scale,^2 both companies' tech could combine in a unique way for a joint RL/RS designed heavy lift vehicle (possibly the Hadron as spitballed above)
- Both companies have good design, PR, and marketing (see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2GT204CEVk), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aJ5NPt5fSM), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kwAPr5G6WA), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BhkjEc6Q64), and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Vf3MlbtAs)), which helps excite the general public and attract talent

Curious what everyone here thinks of both the HLV name brainstorm and a potential team-up with Relativity. Obviously there is an extremely low chance of either happening in this decade, but it's fun to think about as these companies race to develop vehicles that will ultimately launch next-gen constellations, commercial space stations, interplanetary missions, and much more.

Footnotes

1. Some alternatives: Graviton, Baryon, Fermion
2. Stoke Space's [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzqhZLgpiv0) also claims to have cracked the full-reusability problem but they are much earlier-stage and have less funding at this point in time. Definitely worth keeping an eye on though.

Today an article just came out on [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/the-gold-rush-for-the-next-round-of-military-launch-contracts-has-started/) with the following quote that piqued my interest:

Why is this? According to their earnings call today, they have a full Backlog, lot's of missions, and more than enough cash at hand. Electron works reliably. They have two launch sites. Why ain't they launching twice a month?

Thanks for your insights and speculations. I am asking out of curiosity, but also out of a little bit concern as a small investor.",4,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/11f1biy/why_aint_rocketlab_be_launching/
Rocket Lab scraps air-reusability captures in favor of water retrievals.,"Rocket Lab has announced during conference call for Q4 2022 results that it intends to pursue water-based recovery of electron first stages instead of air-reusability captures. Further update was provided by Adam SPice a couple weeks ago who confirmed that last air capture failure due to a loss of telementary was caused due to a failure of one of the paracutes attached to the electron first stage. 

P.S: I tried warning people on this sub about this prospect over a week ago and nobody took me seriously :(

"With Starshield, SpaceX readies for battle","PURSUIT OF DEFENSE DOLLARS
What SpaceX has done with Starlink is to visibly demonstrate how commercial space technology serves national security applications, said Peter Arment, aerospace and defense industry analyst at Baird investment bank.

‚ÄúThis helps SpaceX obviously but also helps the entire industry attract investment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe defense spending space is sort of a rising tide at the moment.‚Äù

Before anyone had ever heard of Starshield, other companies in the space industry started making moves to be better positioned to compete in the national security arena.

Commercial launch provider and satellite manufacturer Rocket Lab on Dec. 1 announced it is establishing a U.S.-based subsidiary for defense and intelligence work, including classified programs.

The new business, called Rocket Lab National Security, will have ‚Äúclose engagement with U.S. government customers to understand their mission requirements, which may be dedicated rapid call-up launch, satellite design, build and integration, spacecraft operations or all of the above,‚Äù Rocket Lab spokesperson Murielle Baker said in a statement.

Tess Hatch, vice president of Bessemer Venture Partners, a Rocket Lab investor, said the mood has shifted from a year ago ‚Äúwhen investors in boardrooms were pounding our fists on the table saying ‚Äògrowth at all cost.‚Äô‚Äù Defense customers can be ‚Äúa little lumpy and unpredictable. However, there are massive potential contracts,‚Äù Hatch said Dec. 6 at the TechCrunch Space conference.

‚ÄúWith markets down and maybe commercial needing to push a little more throttle, the diversity of the customer base is so important,‚Äù Hatch said. ‚ÄúThe government is extra helpful for space companies right now when the commercial side isn‚Äôt as efficient.‚Äù",27,3,https://spacenews.com/with-starshield-spacex-readies-for-battle/

Electron will deploy three satellites for radio frequency
geospatial analytics provider HawkEye 360. The
mission will be the first of three Electron launches for
HawkEye 360 in a contract that will see Rocket Lab
deliver 15 satellites to low Earth orbit between late
2022 and 2024. These missions will grow HawkEye
360‚Äôs constellation of radio frequency monitoring
satellites, enabling the company to better deliver
precise mapping of radio frequency emissions
anywhere in the world.

Time for Rocket Lab to re-consider air-captures?,"So, given that the last two air-capture attempts both ended in failure, I feel it might be time for Rocket Lab to re-consider it's re-usability program. Earlier this year, Rocket Lab managed to [succesfully re-ignite a first stage engine](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/01/rocket-lab-fires-up-its-first-recovered-engine-on-track-to-full-booster-reusability/) after it was retrieved from the ocean. This suggests that air captures may in fact be unnecessary and instead of further promoting the company to investors, it is actually acheiving the opposite effect due to the [negative media coverage](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/04/business/rocket-lab-helicopter-booster-catch-scn/index.html). My personal recommednation would be to cancel the air-capture attempts and retreive all future booster stages from the ocean using the retreival vessel. This avoids putting lives at undue risk for publicity purposes while still enabling the company to re-use the first stage engines. The helicopters can be re-tasked to spot the landing locations of the booster stages for the retrieval vessel.",0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/yme706/time_for_rocket_lab_to_reconsider_aircaptures/
"Rocket Lab on Twitter: After a great launch, we can confirm the primary mission is on track!

## Quick Facts
+ This will be the **32st** **Electron** from **Rocket Lab's LC-1**.
+ This will be the **9th** Launch for **Rocket Lab** this Year.
+ The Rocket is made out of **2** liquid-fuelled stages and **1** liquid-fuelled kickstage.

[](/# MC // section mission)
# Primary Mission: Deployment of payload into correct orbit

Electron will carry a science research satellite by
space systems provider OHB Sweden for the Swedish
National Space Agency (SNSA). The Mesospheric
Airglow/Aerosol Tomography and Spectroscopy
(MATS) satellite is the basis for the SNSA‚Äôs science
mission to investigate atmospheric waves and
better understand how the upper layer of Earth‚Äôs
atmosphere interacts with wind and weather patterns
closer to the ground. MATS was originally due to fly
on a Russian launch service before the mission was
manifested on Rocket Lab‚Äôs Electron.


The Swedish National Space Agency, SNSA, is a central
governmental agency under the Ministry of Education
and Research. SNSA is responsible for national and
international activities relating to space and remote
sensing, primarily research and development.
The mission‚Äôs science partner is the Department of
Meteorology at Stockholm University (MISU).

[](/# MC // section landing)
# Recovery Attempt

Using a modified Sikorsky S-92 large helicopter, Rocket
Lab will attempt to capture the Electron rocket‚Äôs first
stage mid-air as it returns from space after launch.

"Rocket Lab to Launch 31st Mission, Deploying Environmental Monitoring Satellite for General Atomics",,68,0,https://spacechannel.com/rocket-lab-to-launch-31st-mission-deploying-environmental-monitoring-satellite-for-general-atomics/
Why use and Oxygen Rich Closed Cycle on Archimedes and not a Fuel Rich Closed Cycle?,Anyone understand why RocketLab hasn't used a fuel rich staged combustion cycle for their new Archimedes engine but is going with Oxygen rich?  From my very limited understanding (Everyday Astronaut school of Rocket Engine Cycles) is seems like once the fuel is CH and not RP1 the coking problems for a fuel rich pre burner disappear.  This problem must have been solved by SpaceX for their CH fuel rich pre burner on the Raptor.  But it seems that one of the big challenges for Raptor was SpaceX developing a new alloy for their O2 rich pre burner for Raptor.  Is RocketLab working on new alloys for this or has rocket engine metallurgy moved on since the start of Raptor development?,39,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xvqw1q/why_use_and_oxygen_rich_closed_cycle_on/

"~600 kg, RTLS, multi-core, Electron++ ?","~600 kg to LEO, RTLS, multi-core, Electron++ ?

 &nbsp;

**Rationale**

* Competitors are aiming for this payload class, Astra, Virgin Orbit, Firefly (1,000 kg), Terra 1 (1,500 kg)  
* MDA, with RocketLab, is building 500 kg satellites, could be launched by RL  
* Gain RTLS [propulsive landing] experience  
* Gain landing leg experience  
* Gain relight experience 
* Retain staff building rockets for potentially more customers
* Use returned boosters to increase launch cadence


 &nbsp;

**Proposing**  

* Triple booster first stage, no staging  
* Double second-stage or single extended  
* Landing legs for RTLS  
* Maybe larger fairing with dual second stage with interstage  


 &nbsp;

**Possible configuration**  

* Triangle configuration of boosters (no staging), with landing legs, nosecone on one of the boosters  
* Inline configuration of two second stages (no staging) mounted on two of the boosters
* 1 m  or 2 m fairing (which would require new molds) plus funky interstage


 &nbsp;

**Discussion:**  

* A triple booster should have enough reserve propellant and thrust to lift the RTLS propellant, legs and account for extra drag.  Either triple-engine landing or dual-engine landing possibilities (depending on landing mass).  
* A dual booster would mean unmodified second stages fastened together, provide thrust needed for up to 600 kg to LEO.  
* A payload interstage would be needed.  
* Could call it Anion (extra electrons)",0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xt9yt3/600_kg_rtls_multicore_electron/

RocketLab Capsule,"Rocket Lab, during the investor day, presented some illustrations for a human capsule for Neutron. While presenting, the company was very clear that this was not a capsule announcement but they are looking into the topic.

However, what is interesting is the size of the capsule presented with a human for scale. (Another member made a post on how much bigger the capsule is relative to Dragon from SpaceX).

To investigate whether the illustration was a mistake, I did some digging using the 2nd illustration of the capsule with a docking station. I utilized the docking station as a measurement foundation and compared the illustration with a relatively similar picture of a Dragon with a docking station. Here is what I found (rough measurements).

1. RocketLab's capsule is rougly 2.6 times the diameter of the docking station.
2. Dragon is rought 1.8 times the diameter of the docking station.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

1. It seems like that RKLB did not make a mistake when they showed a human for scale. RKLB may indeed be planning a much bigger capsule than Dragon and Starliner. (RKLB rarely makes mistakes on slides and it would be unlikely they made the size mistake on two slides)

Counter-argument; Dragon and Starliner are rougly 12 tonnes. Neutron in expendable mode can deliver 13 tonnes to LEO. Therefore it would be unlikely that they are planning a larger capsule.

Counter-counter argument:

1. RKLB is known for innovation and it is likely that they with the technology of 2025-2026 could develop a much lighter capsule
2. Neutron's performance metrics are based on the rocket performing in a chill mode. More performance could be achieved by pushing the engines to near their limit. i.e. Neutron if need be could potentially deliver +20 tonnes to LEO.

Let me know what you think?

&#x200B;

Update:

ISS docking station actual diameter: 2.4 meters

Estimated dragon diameter: 4.3 (actual 4) meters

Estimated RKLB capsule diameter: 6.2 meters

&#x200B;

I will now explain why I believe Rocket Lab will design its own manned spacecraft, and will not use Soyuz spacecraft.

&#x200B;

\-Rocket Lab has recently announced that they plan to deliver cargo around the world, (sort of like E2E).

So obviously they will design a re-entry vehicle...then they could adapt it for the manned missions they have announced.

\-If Rocket Lab were to buy a Soyuz capsule, they would be using Russian technology... and there are problems with Russia.

They would also be wasting money if in the future they want to build their own capsule....

And there are many other factors...

\-The Starliner can't be launched on Neutron in the reusable version, and besides, the starliner doesn't even work lol....

\-In the future there will be several space stations, and RL will not be left behind.

Also, for now Europe doesn't have its own spacecraft, the Susie spacecraft is under development, and according to what ArianeGroup has announced, operational flights will arrive in 2030.

So RL could develop a capsule or support body to sell seats to Europe.

\-The small spacecraft could also serve as a reusable second stage and RL would have a fully reusable multipurpose vehicle.",45,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xivd25/rocket_lab_will_design_its_own_crewed_spacecraft/

Why re-usability isn't a priority for Rocket Lab..,"Some people in the investor group I am a part have been asking why Rocket Lab doesn't seem to be prioritising re-usability. The problem with Electron is that it was never originally designed to be re-usable. The company also [over-estimated demand for the small launch industry](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/peter-beck-explains-why-electron-may-only-ever-launch-10-15-times-a-year/) and thus is producing Electron rockets at a faster rate than they are being used. Therefore, re-usability currently serves no purpose other than to boost the company's reputation. I suspect they also do not want another failed catch as this could damage the company's reputation and leed to a loss of confidence amoung investors. Personally, I suspect Rocket Lab will eventually do away with in-air captures and simply retrieve the first stages out of the ocean.",19,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xfgnjx/why_reusability_isnt_a_priority_for_rocket_lab/

Can Rocket Lab Replicate Starlink-TMobile Arrangement?,"I was fascinated by the latest announcement of an agreement between Starlink and T-Mobile, for  globe-spanning cellphone service coverage:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5DdP9uvkEs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5DdP9uvkEs)

This will surely be a Killer App for SpaceX's upcoming Starship launch vehicle, deploying their upcoming Starlink v2 satellites into orbit. There will surely be a demand for this type of communication network if it works as advertised, fulfilling the promise of what Iridium was supposed to be.

I was wondering whether Rocket Lab with its own in-house expertise from its family of satellite component builders might be able to come up with a comparable solution as this. Something like that would surely create demand for Neutron's launch services, especially with the rapid launch turnaround Neutron is meant for.

So Neutron obviously won't have a fairing as large as Starship's, but could some of the well-known origami techniques be used to create large unfolding antenna arrays that could snugly fit into Neutron's payload fairing for launch? Elon Musk said Starlink v2 would be using the world's most advanced Phased Array antennae, which could both detect the comparatively weaker signals from cellphones and compensate for Doppler frequency shift. Is anything like that within the capabilities of Rocket Lab or its family of subsidiary companies?

Surely a globe-spanning mobile cellular telecom network would be the ultimate demand-driver for the kind of launch cadence Neutron aspires to.",28,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wzw1lb/can_rocket_lab_replicate_starlinktmobile/

"Rocket Lab's path to Profitability: Increasing SolAero Gross Margins, Electron Recovery, and Responsive Launches","In Rocket Lab's [earnings call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE) yesterday, they made some very interesting statements about how the company plans to increase gross margins and achieve profitability.

First, Rocket Lab [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE&t=2622s) that increasing gross margin on AolAero is the best thing that they can do to improve profitability on the Space Systems side. Rocket Lab said that they have a 24 month plan to increase SolAero gross margins from ""high single digits"" to a whopping 30%! They said that they are very confident in this plan, and that executing on it is only a matter of time. Rocket Lab said that revenue from the acquired companies SolAero, Advanced Solutions Inc, and Planetary Systems Corporation was $28M in Q2 2022, and the vast majority (> $20M?) was from SolAero. Therefore, increasing the gross margin to 30% on SolAero revenue is a really big deal!

Secondly, Rocket Lab [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE&t=3102s) that for their new [Responsive Space Program](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-introduces-responsive-space-program/), the cost per launch is 15-30% higher than the typical Electron launch price of $7.5M, and the vast majority of that 15-30% markup goes directly to gross margin since most of their launch costs are fixed costs. Between Electron reuse (70% of cost is in the first stage) and responsive launches, I see a clear path to increasing the gross margins of Electron!

These statements really help to paint a clear path to profitability in my mind. With stronger than expected revenues and a clear path to profitability, it‚Äôs no wonder that Rocket Lab stock surged over 20% today. What do you guys think? What do you think Rocket Lab's plans for SolAero are? Increasing automation? Integration of solar panels into other components? Outsourcing of manufacturing? I sure hope it isn‚Äôt outsourcing, the United States really needs to manufacture its own solar panels.",73,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wmsfbg/rocket_labs_path_to_profitability_increasing/

"My gut feeling: Solaero acquisition was a mistake, and perhaps a very bad one","I expressed a lot of concerns back in December about that acquisition:
 - 5 % gross margins: there is not really any cost savings with this acquisition. Why not just buy the solar panels directly from a third party, just like I assume spaceX does??? SpaceX doesn‚Äôt seem to have any issues sourcing solar panels!
 - Massive 60 % expansion of headcount at rocketlab
 - Rocketlab has 0 experience in solar panels construction
 - Massive distraction on top of the many challenges the company already faces 

To the list above we can now

 - runaway inflation, which likely is going to be a big deal when selling something manufacturing intensive with 5 % gross margin

Was this acquisition motivated by the revenue increase from the low margin solar panels? I sincerely hope not. Because here‚Äôs the deal: most investors don‚Äôt give any multiple multiple to this.

I listened to the earning call today‚Ä¶ and I can‚Äôt help but feel that my concerns were warranted. Very negative contribution to gross margins.

Neutron could end-up becoming the go-to for defense contracts?,"Although Neutron is arguably an engeering marvel, I fully expect the launch vehicle to get outcompeted in commercial space sector by the Terran R & New Glenn heavy-lift launch vehicles developed by Relativity Space and New Glenn, respectively. Relativity Space [has already lined up a series of launches for it's Terran R rocket valued at around 1.2 billion](https://www.relativityspace.com/press-release/2022/06/30/terranroneweblsa). Blue Origin's New Glenn [has been selected by Amazon to carry out at least 12 launches for project Kuiper](https://www.blueorigin.com/news/amazon-selects-new-glenn-for-kuiper/). Rocket Lab on the other hand, has no publicly stated launch contracts for it's Neutron Rocket. However, it has been [awared a contract by the U.S Space Force to develop the Neutron upper stage worth approx 24.35 million](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-wins-24m-u-s-space-force-contract-to-develop-neutron-upper-stage/). It seems from this that Rocket Lab has already missed out on a number of cruicial launch contracts from the commercial space sector. Though they have been recognised by the U.S Space Force and with their recent Electron launches for the NRO, it is possible that Neutron may be selected as the go-to for the defense sector in the United States. With rising geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and now Taiwan, it would not surprise me if the majority of Neutron's launches were comprised of defense contracts provided by the U.S Space Force, NRO and possibly others.",28,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wlist1/neutron_could_endup_becoming_the_goto_for_defense/

How will Rocket Lab deal with this new tech that is being developed?

Photon will need an upgrade to be a servicer tug, better engine, and robotic arm. Instead of pumping fuel, I like quick exchange of fuel tanks, less mess. This means someone has to build a tank farm in several orbital planes.

Building satellites  on orbit may give Electron new life, ferrying new components to old satellites. Reaching GEO with the weight/ mass of a big reaction wheel may be out of reach, but new sensors should be doable.

Rocket Lab generating negative revenue on Electron Launches?,"Hey, so I'm part of a small investor group on Discord which follows space stocks. Recently one of our members [revealed that Rocket Lab is operating electron launches at a net loss](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/998003492503421018/1005151082512662588/IMG_0619.png?width=1200&height=301). He came to this conclusion after digging around in the quarterly earnings reports which report revenues and expenses related to launches and then counted the number of launches in that quarter by referring to Rocket Lab's [completed missions](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/) page. Now obviously, this may not be entirely unexpected for a company that is still relatively new. However, I find the lack of transparency regarding this issue concerning. Investors should not have to go to this level of detail just to uncover that a company is generating negative returns on launches. Obviously, they are generaing revenues from their subsidiary companies as well as the sales of [reaction wheels](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/space-systems/satellite-components/reaction-wheels/) and [star trackers](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/space-systems/satellite-components/star-trackers/). Hopefully, as launch cadence improves and re-usability becomes more streamlined, the company may end up breaking even. Don't get me wrong, I love what Rocket Lab does (it's amazing), but I just feel a little.. annoyed that Peter Beck hasn't stated that they are generating negative revenues from the launches.

&#x200B;

Additional information regarding calculations:

1. CoR = Cost of Revenue r/L = Revenue per launch CoR/L = Cost of Revenue per Launch
2. \*\*\*\[***4:33 AM***\]\*\*\*I don‚Äôt know what was going on in Q3 21\` so I pulled that out of the margin calculation, since it felt like an outlier. With that in, margin would have obviously been MUCH lower.

Is Relativity Space overpromising?,"I acknowledge that this is a bit of a rhetorical question, because RS hasn't launched yet, but that's kind of the point. They haven't launched Terran 1 yet, but they've announced plans with insane deadlines to send a second generation launch vehicle that's going to be as big as Starship to Mars (and beat SpaceX there, no less). Somehow, even though they haven't launched anything, they have enormous amounts of funding and a [pad at Cape Canaveral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_Space#Cape_Canaveral_LC-16). They will be having the [first launch](https://www.spacelaunchschedule.com/launch/terran-1-maiden-flight/) of Terran 1 later this month.

Full admission, I'm biased against RS because I'm invested in RKLB, and RS is a private company which us retail investors aren't able to invest in. If RS is as good as they claim to be, then they would obviously be a threat to RKLB, which until now, has been second best next to SpaceX, and the best space launch investment option on the public markets by far.

At the same time, I see the wild claims that RS makes, and it makes my bullshit detector want to go off. Sure, RS has cool 3D printing tech, but does that really qualify them as rocket designers? Rocket engineering is notoriously hard. Announcing ambitious plans and timelines for a second generation vehicle when you haven't even launched one of your first generation vehicles reeks both of arrogance and of inexperience. It seems pretty obvious that they will want to make many changes to the design of their vehicles and iterate.

Technology wise, I get that they have a cool metal 3D printer, but it makes me cringe every time I hear them say that their technology is powered by ""AI"". To me, that says that the company is relying on buzzwords to lure naive investors that have no understanding of the technology involved. We also know that their rocket is not, in fact, fully 3D printed. I personally doubt that their construction method is particularly cost-effective, but that remains to be seen.

This last point is debatable, but I also feel like the relatively large size of the Terran 1 rocket is an error. It's a fairly large two-stage vehicle. If you've ever used a 3D printer, you know that the time needed to print something increases rapidly with the size of the object. Having a large rocket means that your prints take much longer, which in turn means that you iterate quite a bit slower. RS could have chosen to start by printing a smaller suborbital rocket so they can really test their technology, iterate rapidly on design changes, and then go for an orbital vehicle when they have more experience. Instead they're directly going for a large two-stage rocket and trying to launch it to orbit. If they need to iterate on this, it will take longer and be more costly.

RS is having their first launch later this month. Maybe they'll succeed and we'll all be really impressed that they've nailed it on their first try. Or maybe Terran 1 will blow up, there will be months of delays after that, and we'll eventually find out that RS has more in common with Nikola than SpaceX.",42,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wiex5n/is_relativity_space_overpromising/

"So now that Astra won‚Äôt be launching anything until probably 2024, what does this mean for Rocket Lab?","Astra has [cancelled](https://spacenews.com/astra-cancels-rocket-3-to-focus-on-larger-vehicle/) the Rocket 3 program and says they won‚Äôt launch any customer payloads until around 2024 when Rocket 4 is ready. Personally, I think Astra will go bankrupt before Rocket 4 is ready. The issue is that Astra is burning through their cash at a rate of $85M per quarter, have zero revenue, and have only $200M in cash left. I don‚Äôt see any good way for Astra to raise more money, either. At the time of this posting, Astra has a $343.40M market cap, which shows that most of the value of the company is just that $200M pile of cash. Once that cash is gone, so is their market cap and their ability to raise more capital.

In their earnings call yesterday, Astra also said that Rocket 3 was not a commercially viable product, and even if it did work reliably, there were simply not enough interested customers for it to be successful. Apparently satellites are growing in size and customers want larger rockets like Terran R, as evidenced by Relativity Space‚Äôs ridiculous [$1.2B backlog](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/30/relativity-space-inks-deal-with-oneweb-reaches-1-2b-in-terran-r-launch-contracts/).

I wonder what this means for Rocket Lab and the future of Electron? In my opinion, it looks like Electron might be the only smallsat launcher left standing. There is little incentive for anyone else to develop a competitor for Electron since it seems that rockets of this size are not commercially viable. But there is a silver lining. Rocket Lab is at least able to mostly break even on their Electron launches. This gives them an extremely cost effective R&D testbed to develop the technology they need for Neutron. Electron also gives Rocket Lab publicity and helps them to build up launch heritage and relationships with customers.

Did Rocket Lab take inspiration from Pioneer 13 for it's Venus Mission?,"Pioneer 13, also known as Pioneer Venus 2, was a mission carried out by NASA as part of their Pioneer Program which involved sending a range of probes to various objects within the solar system. The design chosen by Rocket Lab has quite a few distinct similarities' to the Pioneer Venus 2 but also a couple noticeable differences. One of the similarities is the design of the probe capsule, which is almost identical in shape. The shape of the spacecraft are also fairly similar with the noticeable difference being that Rocket Lab's design places the solar panels on top of the craft, not the sides. Curious to know what other people think about this.

Quick Facts:

**Lift-off is scheduled for 0955 UTC from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 Pad B.**

Rocket Lab is launching: 
""Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment, also known as CAPSTONE.""


This pathfinding 55-pound CubeSat, will be the first spacecraft to test the Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) around
the Moon.

Researchers expect this orbit to be a gravitational
sweet spot in space ‚Äì where the pull of gravity from
Earth and the Moon interact to allow for a nearly stable orbit.

The orbit will bring CAPSTONE within 1,000 miles
of one lunar pole on its near pass and 43,500
miles from the other pole at its peak every seven
days, requiring less propulsion capability for
spacecraft flying to and from the Moon‚Äôs surface
than other circular orbits.

CAPSTONE is expected to orbit this area around
the Moon for at least six months to understand the
characteristics of the orbit. The NRHO
provides the advantage of an unobstructed view of
Earth in addition to coverage of the lunar South Pole.

The Rocket Lab Analysis (RKLB),"This post explains why Rocket Lab is at its current price one of the greatest investments you can make and why I‚Äôve personally invested my life savings in it. Note, this is not financial advice, I am an ape and a moron.üçå

**Intro.**

Rocket Lab is a rocket company that is working on building a reusable medium lift rocket. They currently have a small rocket (Electron Rocket) and have had over 20+ successful launches to orbit and have deployed over 100 satellites.

The company just received funding via SPAC to go public to fund development of its new medium lift rocket (Neutron Rocket) which is expected to complete by 2024. There is only one company that has successfully accomplished substantial reusability of such a rocket which is SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 rocket.

**Why is reusability so important for a rocket?**

Most rockets today launch and the entire rocket gets destroyed. Imagine if a Boeing 747 airliner had to be destroyed after every flight, each ticket would be over a million dollars a flight for them to make a profit, this is basically what we do with modern rockets. Make that 747 rapidly reusable again and again, and the cost drops dramatically. NASA attempted to do this with the Space Shuttle program because of the insane costs of the Saturn V (Moon rocket) but failed because of large scale refurbishment needs. Today however, SpaceX has shown proof that it is possible with their Falcon 9 and many companies are working on following.

**Competitor Analysis**

**Astra** ‚Äì Lead by Chris Kemp does show promise, however by 8/2021, 4 of their first launches failed (Rocket 1, Rocket 2, Rocket 3.0, Rocket 3.1) with only their 5th rocket making it to to space but still failing to reach stable orbit in December of 2020 (Rocket 3.2). Astra will undoubtedly be a big player one day; however, they are currently far behind Rocket Lab and eons behind SpaceX, therefore they are no threat. (2021 Estimated 100 employees, mrkt cap \~2.5B)

**Relativity Space** ‚Äì This newer space company has two rocket designs:

Terran 1 is an expendable small sat vehicle which is expected to launch in 2022, no threat.

Terran R is a medium/large class rocket designed to be reusable which poses a direct threat and is expected to make first orbital launch by 2024. 

Relativity Space has yet to achieve orbit, and while their plans are big, they have yet to prove their capabilities. Talk is cheap in this game, it doesn‚Äôt matter how much funding you have, achieving orbit is incredibility difficult. While they are somewhat a threat, I have no doubt that RKLB will beat them to a reusable medium class rocket by many years. (2021 estimated 400 employees, mrkt cap \~4.2B Private)

**Firefly Aerospace** ‚Äì This is another early space vehicle developer which has a few vehicles.

Firefly Alpha ‚Äì Expendable small sat vehicle, has many similarities to the RKLBs Electron rocket, as of 8/2021 it has yet to launch with the first planned launch by 9/2021. As a small sat non reusable vehicle this is of no threat.

Firefly Beta ‚Äì Essentially a scaled up Alpha medium class rocket planned to launch in 2024, it doesn‚Äôt appear to have reusability designed in but they are boasting to have the lowest cost 8000kg LEO delivery vehicle. No threat, the future of space is reusable not expendable, we‚Äôll see how that goes with an expendable design.

Firefly Gamma ‚Äì 2 Stage medium class rocket designed to have the first stage reusable. Highly similar design as a Falcon 9 or the Neutron Rocket and a direct competitor. Planned test flights to start in 2024-2025. 

While the Gamma vehicle is a direct threat, Firefly has yet to achieve orbit with any of their vehicles. Their funding is dismal and they are spreading their R&D over multiple vehicles which will strain their resources greatly. They should probably scrap their Beta project and go straight to Gamma, regardless, on their current course RKLB will beat them by many years even though they are estimating completion at around the same time as neutron. (2021 Estimated 350 employees, mrkt cap \~500M Private)

**Virgin Galactic and Virgin Orbit** \- Excluding Virgins Galactics commercial tourism vehicle, Virgin Orbit has a small sat deployment rocket which launches off an aircraft at high altitude. This was recently announced to go public via SPAC. This is a non-reusable rocket and poses no threat as an expendable small rocket, they will need to switch to a ground launch vehicle if they plan on designing any larger vehicles that would be considered competition. Virgin Galactics space tourism vehicle is another market entirely and also poses no threat.

**SpaceX** ‚Äì SpaceX is the king of the jungle and king of agile development; they have proven the proof of concept and essentially hold the golden standard with their Falcon 9 that RKLB and all the other companies are pushing to match. They currently have the only reusable vehicle in the market and their costs are a fraction of their current expendable vehicle competitors. SpaceX has since stopped upgrades with the Falcon 9 and focused all of their efforts on their new super heavy class vehicle the Starship. The Falcon 9 is a direct competitor however there is enough room in space for two, Elon has shown interest in the Neutron Rocket and Peter Beck and seems to be supportive and sees the value in competition, mainly since he probably sees them as a little brother. Therefore, unless SpaceX decides to become extremely competitive with the Falcon 9 to specifically spite RKLB‚Ä¶ unlikely, they shouldn‚Äôt be a huge threat. The Falcon 9 will no doubt remain #1 for medium/heavy rockets and take the best contracts, but there is enough room for the Neutron Rocket to get some of the market share.

The main concern here is the Starship. A new fully reusable super heavy class vehicle with its maiden flight coming up fast, it could likely start launching satellites as early as next year. Will a fully reusable super heavy class vehicle swoop up all the planetary demand for launch vehicles and hurt Rocket Lab? It might drive down costs, but I think there is plenty of backlog and demand for a superheavy class vehicle to not be as much of a burden. (2021 Estimated 9500 employees, mrkt cap ~75B private)

**Blue Origin** ‚Äì Amazons Jeff Bezos company is also exploring reusable rockets.

The famous phallic New Shepard rocket is essentially a suborbital vehicle which is incapable of deploying satellites or making it to orbit. 

New Glenn ‚Äì This vehicle is a superheavy class fully reusable vehicle in similar competition with SpaceX‚Äôs starship, expected to launch in 2022. There have yet to be any flight tests, so this timeline will likely be pushed to 2023 and beyond.

Blue Origin has been working with much secrecy until now with their new developments so it is difficult to accurately gauge their effectiveness. Regardless, if they are successful the New Glenn could pose to be a major threat. Jeff Bezos has been publishing many hate articles bad mouthing SpaceX and while their tech currently sucks, it is no doubt that if they make a reusable vehicle, they will be a cancerous and below the belt fighting competition. Jeff has enough money himself to bankroll the operation through development no matter how long it takes, and could even theoretically buy out RKLB in its entirety himself, so Blue Origin remains a threat, only time will tell how serious of a threat they will be.

**Others** \- One odd reality with the big prime contractors and government bodies like Lockheed Martin / Boeing (ULA), NASA and others, is that they are not pursuing reusable vehicles, as clear as it is and how profitable it will be, they have made ZERO attempt to pursue this path. Mainly because it is incredibly expensive, takes many years to see a return on investment, and is incredibility difficult to even achieve. They are likely too large, led by corporate goons with no vision. One reality is certain, short of discovering anti-gravity technology, reusable rockets are without a doubt, the future of space travel.

**Rocket Lab Pros**

Rocket Lab currently holds the second most frequentlu annually launched vehicle in the US (Electron Rocket) with over 20 launches as of 8/2021. They have proven their capabilities and ability to achieve orbit and their agile development with minimal funding and personnel.

They have enough money from the SPAC to develop the Neutron Rocket and still hold many shares should they need more in the future.

Proof of concept has been established with SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9; all they need to do is copy that.

They are led by a hands-on engineer who developed rockets, seems to have a great vision, and doesn‚Äôt appear to be a sellout. Very Elon Muskesque. 

Finally, they have enough name recognition to attract enough talent in the industry to pull in new employees to help develop their new vehicle. 

SpaceX had 4 failures and 1 successful small vehicle launch (Falcon 1) before beginning to develop the Falcon 9, with no name recognition, no proof of concept, and no commercialization of space. Rocket Lab has a thousand times more advantage than they did at the time. No other company is in a better position to design a medium class reusable rocket than Rocket Lab is today.

Photon - Rocket Lab also has a customizable universal satellite system called Photon. This satellite can be customized to any customers needs. The main advantage of this is that many customers are searching for a one stop solution, they don't necessarily want to develop satellites especially if they have never done so in the past, it's likely much cheaper for most companies to pay a well proven vehicle that can be customized to their needs, placed in an orbit they need, and collect the data that they need. Photon and systems alike will make it much easier and cheaper for companies to buy and deploy satellites and you could even theoretically argue a rental model for the future for more common orbits and purposes. My personal concern is the barriers for entry for a system like Photon is much easier (still extremely difficult) to develop than a launch vehicle itself, there are already many companies who have specialized and designed their own satellites who could pivot into this market which could make competition difficult, therefore I focused this post on the ground to space transport system.

**Conclusion**

Based on the above, Rocket Lab is essentially the #1 public company to invest in, that will reach market the quickest and has the best odds. That along with the potential Space Boom and Space Bubble that is yet to come shows that RKLB is an absolute great investment right now for a 10‚Äì20-year investment. With enough hype, it could 10-20x within a year or two. Again, this is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor, I am a moron and an ape, and a man who loves aerospace.

###Launch window:

The 10-day launch window opens on Saturday 20^th January 2018, NZST. During this time a four-hour launch window will open daily from 2:30 p.m. NZDT (0130 UTC).

The test launch attempt will only proceed if conditions are ideal for launch. Due to the nature of launching rockets, planned lift-offs are often subject to multiple and subsequent postponements, or scrubs, to allow for small, technical modifications and to wait for ideal weather conditions.

"So now that Astra won‚Äôt be launching anything until probably 2024, what does this mean for Rocket Lab?","Astra has [cancelled](https://spacenews.com/astra-cancels-rocket-3-to-focus-on-larger-vehicle/) the Rocket 3 program and says they won‚Äôt launch any customer payloads until around 2024 when Rocket 4 is ready. Personally, I think Astra will go bankrupt before Rocket 4 is ready. The issue is that Astra is burning through their cash at a rate of $85M per quarter, have zero revenue, and have only $200M in cash left. I don‚Äôt see any good way for Astra to raise more money, either. At the time of this posting, Astra has a $343.40M market cap, which shows that most of the value of the company is just that $200M pile of cash. Once that cash is gone, so is their market cap and their ability to raise more capital.

In their earnings call yesterday, Astra also said that Rocket 3 was not a commercially viable product, and even if it did work reliably, there were simply not enough interested customers for it to be successful. Apparently satellites are growing in size and customers want larger rockets like Terran R, as evidenced by Relativity Space‚Äôs ridiculous [$1.2B backlog](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/30/relativity-space-inks-deal-with-oneweb-reaches-1-2b-in-terran-r-launch-contracts/).

I wonder what this means for Rocket Lab and the future of Electron? In my opinion, it looks like Electron might be the only smallsat launcher left standing. There is little incentive for anyone else to develop a competitor for Electron since it seems that rockets of this size are not commercially viable. But there is a silver lining. Rocket Lab is at least able to mostly break even on their Electron launches. This gives them an extremely cost effective R&D testbed to develop the technology they need for Neutron. Electron also gives Rocket Lab publicity and helps them to build up launch heritage and relationships with customers.

"For the humor of it: in theory, could the Electron launch a single reckless astronaut to the ISS?","This is very much a silly question, but given that the Electron has a payload capacity of up to 300kg, I've been wondering if it would in theory be possible for one single daredevil astronaut to sit inside the fairing, wearing a lightweight space suit, and hitch a ride up to the ISS.

This obviously leaves very little weight for things like docking thrusters, so I guess the second stage would have to make it all the way to the ISS along with our astronaut and match its speed and position with the ISS as closely as possible. We'd probably have to hope that this ride would be relatively quick as well (max 6-8 hours?) given that the only oxygen reserves would be in the spacesuit itself.

For shielding from vibrations during launch, we'll assume that our astronaut is surrounded by or sitting on some kind of lightweight foam. Not sure how they would transfer from the second stage of the rocket to the ISS when they get there. Ideally the second stage would get very close and they could just manually grab onto it and make their way to the airlock. Elevator music would be played through the spacesuit's comm system during the ascent.

I hope nobody gets mad at me for posting this, I just thought it would be funny to entertain the idea.",112,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/qbfatp/for_the_humor_of_it_in_theory_could_the_electron/

Relative Valuations of Rocket Lab and Closest Competitors,"The biggest knock I hear against Rocket Lab is its valuation. So, I decided to look up the valuation of Rocket Lab's closest competitors. Here is what I found:

&#x200B;

**Firefly Aerospace**: $1B valuation,  launching orbital test flight later this yr. No commercial launches. (Alpha: 1000 kg to LEO)    [https://www.rocketlaunchschedule.com/firefly-aerospace-firefly-alpha-maiden-flight/](https://www.rocketlaunchschedule.com/firefly-aerospace-firefly-alpha-maiden-flight/)

**Astra Space**: $2.1B valuation, launching first orbital flight with USSF test payload this month (Aug. 27th). (500 kg to LEO)   [https://www.space.com/astra-launch-space-force-satellite-this-month](https://www.space.com/astra-launch-space-force-satellite-this-month) 

&#x200B;

**Virgin Orbit**: $3B valuation, two successful commercial launches to orbit. (Launcher One: 500 kg to LEO)  [https://www.space.com/virgin-orbit-launch-seven-satellies](https://www.space.com/virgin-orbit-launch-seven-satellies) 

&#x200B;

**Rocket Lab**: $4.1B valuation (post-merger), 17 successful orbital launches, 105 satellites placed in orbit, 3 more missions in Aug-Sept., NASA moon mission in Q4 2021, burgeoning space systems business, and 8000 kg payload Neutron launching in 2024. (Electron: 300 kg to LEO)  [https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/) 

&#x200B;

**Relativity Space**: $4.2B valuation, launching first orbital test flight this yr. (Terran 1: 1250 kg to LEO)  [https://www.reuters.com/technology/relativity-space-raises-650-mln-bigger-3d-printed-rocket-2021-06-08/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/relativity-space-raises-650-mln-bigger-3d-printed-rocket-2021-06-08/)  

&#x200B;

The point being, developing a successful rocket company is damn hard and many have closed up shop trying. What SpaceX has done to initiate this ""new space"" race is remarkable. What Peter Beck has done with Rocket Lab is also pretty damn remarkable considering where he came from and the fact that New Zealand had no space industry really to speak of.   

Investors are going to have to pay a premium to invest in a rocket company that is currently successful and is generating revenue now. Not all of the companies on this list will make it, and there are many more out there that are joining the game. So let's appreciate the ones that are already successful at this point.  

**Here's an analogy I like to use when people say that you should invest in Astra before Rocket Lab because they have half the valuation**: 

Why does Kevin Durant (small forward for the NBA's Brooklyn Nets) make $41M in the 2021-2022 season, whereas Cade Cunningham (#1 2021 NBA draft pick for Detroit Pistons) only gets paid $8.4M. Cunningham is an awesome basketball player and may one day be a max-deal player like Kevin Durant, but as of right now, he hasn't played a single game in the NBA. He has the potential to be great, but until he gains experience and proves himself, he's not as valuable to his team as Kevin Durant is to the Nets (or Team USA for that matter). Rocket Lab is Kevin Durant and Astra is Cade Cunningham in this analogy if you haven't put that together at this point. I do believe Astra will be successful in a couple of years, but there is no denying that Rocket Lab is 4-5 years ahead of Astra, and with the expansion of Rocket Lab's business into space systems and satellites, I think they widen the gap further between them and their competitors, while hopefully also narrowing the gap between them and SpaceX, the latter being the clear leader right now by a long shot.

&#x200B;

**Disclosure**: This is not financial advice. Invest at your own risk. I am invested long in Rocket Lab and Astra, but more heavily in Rocket Lab because of their multi-year track record for success. Could change depending on how the space economy develops.",105,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/p4gyip/relative_valuations_of_rocket_lab_and_closest/

/Pavboy1,"This is unfortunately a post in passing far too late for a number of reasons to the community, but one that needs be done. 

8 months ago - our mod u/Pavboy1, sadly and suddenly passed away at a young age.

He was travelling around India with his friends and had a stroke of some sort and then contracted Meningitis. He was repatriated to New Zealand prior to succumbing to the illness, and his life celebrated with close friends and family. 

He did a whole lot for this sub and was a friend of mine indeed. He's missed and will forever be a part of r/RocketLab in mod and in memory. 

As a community and as Kiwi's I'd like to try and organise something fitting for James:Pavboy1 in some way, dreams are free, but would be so good to get something of his on a flight, be it a plaque or something similar.

Please accept my apologies for the delay and maybe we can get something done to mark the one year of his passing.

## What is going to be on board for this flight?

### STP-27RM 

Rocket Lab will carry the Monolith satellite for the USSF's Space Test Program (STP) to space to explore and demonstrate the use of a deployable sensor, where the sensor‚Äôs mass is a substantial fraction of the total mass of the spacecraft, changing the spacecraft‚Äôs dynamic properties and testing ability to maintain spacecraft attitude control. Analysis from the use of a deployable sensor aims to enable the use of smaller satellite buses when building future deployable sensors such as weather satellites, thereby reducing the cost, complexity, and development timelines.

You‚Äôve heard all the negativity being thrown at Rocket Lab‚Äôs ‚ÄòHumanity Star‚Äô. It‚Äôs time now for a little positivity.,"For those who claim that Humanity Star has no scientific value, I argue the point ‚ÄòWhy does everything in space need to be science related?‚Äô I was hoping we could have space tourism, orbiting hotels, and other non-science endeavors up there as well. Space is a big place. There is room for both. And for those astronomers who claim that it causes light pollution, I argue that it has no lights onboard. The only way to see it is from reflected sunlight. And when it is on the night side of Earth it won‚Äôt be reflecting any sunlight because it will be in the Earth‚Äôs shadow. The only chance you will have of seeing it at all will be around sunrise or sunset. And remember that all satellites reflect sunlight (even the science ones). Airplanes on the other hand do have lights onboard and are visible at night but astronomers don‚Äôt seem to be complaining about them. For those who claim that it is simply more space garbage, be aware that it was placed into an orbit that will cause it to burn up in about 9 months. So it cleans up after itself. And for those who will then claim that it‚Äôll still be ‚Äò9 months of space garbage‚Äô I say the following: Instead of the thousands of evil spy satellites that are up there continuously taking our picture, Humanity Star is peaceful. Nobody is making money off of it. It can be experienced by almost everybody on the planet. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre rich or poor. It doesn‚Äôt matter what language you speak.

# Welcome to the r/RocketLab Launch Thread for ""THERE AND BACK AGAIN""

 I'm u/hitura-nobad hosting for you Electron's 26th launch from New Zealand.
 
 

## Quick Facts
+ This will be the **26th** **Electron** from **Rocket Lab's LC-1**.
+ This will be the *3nd** Launch for **Rocket Lab** this Year.
+ The Rocket is made out of **2** liquid-fuelled stages and **1** liquid-fuelled kickstage.

## Recovery Attempt

‚ÄúThere And Back Again‚Äù is also a recovery mission
where, for the first time, Rocket Lab will attempt a midair capture of Electron‚Äôs first stage as it returns from
space using parachutes and a helicopter.
Like previous recovery missions, Electron‚Äôs first stage
will undertake a series of complex maneuvres designed
to enable it to survive the extreme heat and forces of
atmospheric re-entry. Electron will be equipped with a
heat shield to help protect the stage‚Äôs nine Rutherford
engines and a parachute to slow Electron down in
order for Rocket Lab‚Äôs customized Sikorsky S-92
helicopter to catch the stage as it returns.
After catching the stage, the helicopter will attempt
to offload the stage onto a recovery vessel which will
transport it back to Rocket Lab‚Äôs Production Complex
for analysis. Upon success of this recovery, Electron
will be one step closer to being the first reusable
orbital small sat launcher.

## Targeting : May 1 22:35 UTC

Electron + Photon can send a payload to Jupiter among other things,"As, the title states, yes Jupiter is within reach for Rocketlab.

So while reading this SpaceNews [article](https://spacenews.com/nasa-studying-larger-mars-helicopters/) on Martian helicopters, I had a look at the associated [white paper](https://baas.aas.org/pub/2021n4i361/release/1?readingCollection=7272e5bb) and discovered it was the place peeps had been submitting white papers for the upcoming decadal review. (I had actually been searching for this location for a while, but hadn't found it). Anyway while going through the literally hundreds of papers because I umm... have spare time on my hands let say, I discovered this [little gem](https://baas.aas.org/pub/2021n4i366/release/1?readingCollection=7272e5bb) right here. A paper from Rocketlab on the deep space capabilities of Electron (/GTO launcher) + Photon.

And may I say, it's a little ripper. (although somewhat difficult to find; why hasn't it been advertised???)

https://preview.redd.it/x1972pj9ct771.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9810edba3bebe563c38bde3f8c42b1266b3dcf2

You can see the large variety of available here; Moon (both orbit and surface), Lagrange orbits, comets, asteroids, interstellar objects, the dwarf planet Ceres, Mars (and it's moons), Venus and yes, flybys of Jupiter and it's Moons.

I suppose I should discuss launch vehicles in r/RocketLab. The fact that a SLV Electron with Photon can deliver payloads to the variety of locations listed is impressive, but rideshare GTO is another cheap cost launch with impressive capabilities in it's own right. (also Electron + Photon has a listed C3 capability >0 at 30km\^2/s\^2, which might make it more capable than New Glenn to high C3s, which is a very humorous concept). Neutron/dedicated launches is very interesting here, because the performance increase is significant. These missions will likely break out of the very low cost category (and I think Photon will be made a bit larger), but stuff like Jupiter orbiters instead of flybys becomes within the realm of possibility. (side note: Wet mass of deep space Photon is 320kg.)

[Attempts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_Common_Spacecraft_Bus) at producing a modular space bus for space exploration have been made (and most of the time spacecraft are based on existing commercial satellites), but haven't really been that successful. Photon already has a large commercial base, multiple deep space missions on the books (Capstone, their private Venus mission + 2 for Escapade).

On this discussion on commercial enabled space science; I think this [white paper](https://baas.aas.org/pub/2021n4i169/release/1?readingCollection=7272e5bb) on commercial lunar exploration explains the potential of Photon pretty well;

>This rapid pace of the CLPS missions is also appealing to PIs who, for the first time, have the opportunity to do repeated or iterated investigations to the same planetary destination, and could conceivably have numerous such opportunities in their career. That is a new paradigm for doing science investigations in space.

NASA Venus exploration has been non-existent although just ramped up significantly. But like there was a 25 year gap in NASA missions. That's getting to the point that Venusian specialists from those missions start leaving the workforce because they're too old and people to replace them don't start because there's no missions. It's the closest planet to Earth and yet a gap of 25 years. Think about Ceres scientists; the next mission to there could be decades away, with New Frontiers and Discovery being booked out, so they're just going to have rely on observations by Dawn (which to be fair, they're still getting stuff out of). Unless of course we could do a flyby mission for like 40 million $.

Now on Venus missions, I wouldn't be surprised if Photon ends up aiding those missions by providing an opportunity to send tech demos in like 2026. Basically, small sats missions like Photon aren't going to replace larger missions; instead they will augment and help them achieve so much more both before the mission and in followup observations.

If something goes on a mission previously (like Insight heat probe), your next opportunity to get the data again could be decades away. These commercial  could provide followups to cover failures within years instead. Or avoid it in the first place by catching it out with tech demo missions before it.

Photon is also a whole lot more responsive to opportunities like an interstellar flybys because it's a production line spacecraft.

Honestly though, I'm not mentioning 1/4 of the science possibilities what was mentioned; go check out the paper. This [paper](https://baas.aas.org/pub/2021n4i403/release/1?readingCollection=7272e5bb) provides a list of benefits of commercial based space exploration missions; 1. Risk acceptance 2. Rapid tech iteration, 3. Exploration of under explored targets, 4. New mission architectures (constellations) 5. workforce training and diversification to give better pipeline 6. broadening of career opportunities.

tldr for r/RKLB; buy $RKLB because they're going to be building/launching a whole bunch of deep space missions in the future imo.

This isn't the most cogent post, but look, I'm hyped for this decade of space exploration for many reasons, and stuff like Photon is a driving reason. 60s eat your goddamn heart out; the 20s is going to be the best decade for spaceflight yet and it's just the beginning.",83,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/o8y2lu/electron_photon_can_send_a_payload_to_jupiter/

Neutron will be a bigger rocket. Should we expect Dream Chaser as a potential payload?,"We had a similar discussion on this earlier that the weight of Sierra Space‚Äôs Dream Chaser spacecraft would exceed the payload capability of a Neutron rocket which would of been about 8000 kg. But looks like Rocket Lab is pushing for Neutron to be bigger with most likely a bigger payload capability. Rockets can improve over time; for example the first version of Falcon 9 began with a payload capability of 9000 kg but is now above 22,000 kg with the Block 5 version.

It‚Äôs possible Peter Beck and the Rocket Lab team want to be a little more ambitious and enable more from the design.

Dream Chaser + Neutron could be a huge benefit for human Spaceflight that could generate billions of revenue from NASA‚Äôs Commercial Crew Program.

Here are 3 reasons why I believe this could be beneficial:

1. Dream Chaser is a nearly readied system. The cargo version is getting prepared for a launch in 2022 on the Vulcan rocket. A lot of development has been put into this spacecraft; Sierra Space seems to really confident that this could fly humans soon. Rocket Lab does seem committed to vertical integration but developing and building a human-spacecraft could take years and a lot of funding. It might be easier to use a system that‚Äôs ready to go when the Neutron is ready.

2. Neutron should be more affordable than a Vulcan rocket, and if Neutron is going to have larger capabilities than before then Sierra Space might purchase flights from Rocket Lab.

3. Boeing‚Äôs Starliner is years behind, overpriced, and NASA is losing confidence in it. SpaceX‚Äôs Dragon showed success in the commercial crew program which pretty much guarantees it will be a continued program since it enables human Spaceflight for a fraction of the original cost. But Starliner is a drag for the program, at some point NASA will want to bring another human spacecraft onboard; Dream chaser has already been partially funded by NASA so this vehicle seems most likely.

I just feel like this would be a missed opportunity if Dream Chaser was not consider for being used on a Neutron. What are your thoughts? If Rocket Lab is serious about getting into human Spaceflight I feel like this a good option to take.",78,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/pzvwqf/neutron_will_be_a_bigger_rocket_should_we_expect/

Any competition besides SpaceX?,"I discovered Rocket Lab recently. I follow a guy called Emmet Peppers. He became a multi millionaire with Tesla stock and has a $3 million investment in SpaceX. He talked about a company called Rocketlab (which I of course had never heard about) and I have been intrigued about it ever since and actually watched every single video of Peter Beck that I could find.

The investment thesis is as follows:
 - Rocketlab, while being a very distant second place to SpaceX, is many years ahead of the completion, and that as such, the valuation could be very attractive long term
 - Peter Beck is extremely skilled and talented and could be a generational founder 

I have been trying to validate the assumption that Rocketlab is years ahead of the competition (besides spacex)

It has been somewhat of a challenge because there are from what I read ‚Äú100s of startups‚Äù. I did notice though that some guys, including some guys with YouTube channels about space, often mentioned Astra, Relativity Space and Firefly.

Last months I spent a few hours trying to watch the CEOs of Astra space, Relativity Space and Firefly.

The only CEO that somewhat stood out was the one of Firefly. I would say that Chris Kemp from Astra was probably the one who raised my eyebrows the most when he emphasized on the absolute need to do daily launches, using mobile launch pads, even insisted that having the capability to launch within 24 hours notice would soon be in demand from space startups, argued that 3D printing and reusability were unnecessary, and used the failing OEM car industry as a model for Astra.

I also reviewed the CEO of Relativity Space who somewhat reminded me about Astra (as far as making huge claims). All the CEO was talking about was ‚Äú3D printing‚Äù. I also visited relativity space‚Äôs website and was perplexed by claims such as making a rocket with ‚Äú100x fewer parts‚Äù. I also was perplexed by the Terran R Rocket which relativity space intends to design as fully reusable (the company has never gone to orbit and intends to use full reusability??)

I did not get a chance to review Virgin Orbit. I am in general skeptical of Virgin Galactic and Chamath Palihapitiya (every single SPACs that he‚Äôs involved with seems to be going nowhere). I also noticed that many in the community were making fun of Blue Origin.

Overall I would say I feel a little reassured as RocketLab being ahead of anything besides SpaceX, but I do notice though that several people, including people that I follow, frequently talk about companies like relativity space or ABL.

Is there any company that is a real threat to rocketlab - Besides SpaceX? What are your thoughts?

## What is going to be on board for this flight?
The ANDESITE (Ad-Hoc Network Demonstration for Extended Satellite-Based Inquiry and Other Team Endeavors) sat, the M2 Pathfinder satellite and 3 undisclosed payloads for the NRO 

## ANDESITE
Created by electrical and mechanical engineering students and professors at Boston University, the
ANDESITE spacecraft will use a wireless network of lightweight minisatellites to measure the strength and
the direction of electrical currents flowing in and out of Earth‚Äôs magnetic field, the impact of which can affect
radio communications and electrical systems on Earth. ANDESITE‚Äôs acquired datasets will help researchers
better understand the makeup of Earth‚Äôs polar lights (aka aurora) and better predict potentially dangerous
solar storms.

## M2 Pathfinder
The University of New South Wales (UNSW) Canberra Space, together with the Australian Government,
have developed the M2 Pathfinder ‚Äì a satellite to test communications and other technologies in low
Earth orbit, including reprogrammable software-based radio capabilities.

"Rocket Lab's path to Profitability: Increasing SolAero Gross Margins, Electron Recovery, and Responsive Launches","In Rocket Lab's [earnings call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE) yesterday, they made some very interesting statements about how the company plans to increase gross margins and achieve profitability.

First, Rocket Lab [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE&t=2622s) that increasing gross margin on AolAero is the best thing that they can do to improve profitability on the Space Systems side. Rocket Lab said that they have a 24 month plan to increase SolAero gross margins from ""high single digits"" to a whopping 30%! They said that they are very confident in this plan, and that executing on it is only a matter of time. Rocket Lab said that revenue from the acquired companies SolAero, Advanced Solutions Inc, and Planetary Systems Corporation was $28M in Q2 2022, and the vast majority (> $20M?) was from SolAero. Therefore, increasing the gross margin to 30% on SolAero revenue is a really big deal!

Secondly, Rocket Lab [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE&t=3102s) that for their new [Responsive Space Program](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-introduces-responsive-space-program/), the cost per launch is 15-30% higher than the typical Electron launch price of $7.5M, and the vast majority of that 15-30% markup goes directly to gross margin since most of their launch costs are fixed costs. Between Electron reuse (70% of cost is in the first stage) and responsive launches, I see a clear path to increasing the gross margins of Electron!

These statements really help to paint a clear path to profitability in my mind. With stronger than expected revenues and a clear path to profitability, it‚Äôs no wonder that Rocket Lab stock surged over 20% today. What do you guys think? What do you think Rocket Lab's plans for SolAero are? Increasing automation? Integration of solar panels into other components? Outsourcing of manufacturing? I sure hope it isn‚Äôt outsourcing, the United States really needs to manufacture its own solar panels.",73,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wmsfbg/rocket_labs_path_to_profitability_increasing/
Felix interviewed Peter Beck about all things Rocket Lab!,,73,18,https://youtu.be/7ZR6APowqcg
How important is the upcoming Rocket Lab moon mission is? Am I missing anything?,"https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/lunar/

Scheduled in March of next year, Rocket Lab will launch a electron rocket with a Photon Lunar spacecraft that will carry a CAPSTONE to cis-lunar orbit to the moon.  


Why is this important?  

The goal is to insert a small sat into a near rectilinear lunar halo orbit - something that has never before been attempted before. 

It is important this succeeds for the future or the NASA moon artemis program as it will provide non-stop communication to the Gateway as there will be no blackouts like prior moon missions and it provides access to the entire lunar surface.

The CAPSTONE small sat will be delivered to the moon by a Rocket Lab photon spacecraft.  This photon spacecraft is what makes capstone possible and appears very unique and will help pay the way for the Venus mission.  Also if successful will lead to future customers signing up for Rocket Lab‚Äôs photon spacecraft.

CAPSTONE will be delivered to lunar orbit by the Photon spacecraft, NOT a kickstage or upper stage, but a spacecraft (Photon).  This will be huge to showing the world what the photon can do and will likely lead to more and more missions down the road.

Anything else that makes this mission important?",73,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/rm9jnp/how_important_is_the_upcoming_rocket_lab_moon/
12 years later and some thing's never change...,"
...and some thing's only get better.

Twelve year's ago Peter Beck and Rocket Lab first touched space with Atea 1, a sounding rocket that was never designed to go orbital.

Then a few day's ago Beck and the Rocket Lab team set a new company record for fastest turnaround between orbital launches. 21 days!

It's no surprise to see Becks instinctual celebration has stayed the same.

In this [video](https://youtu.be/ETEWnRsa_Ik) you'll see the launch of Atea-1. The first Rocket built by Beck and the early engineers at Rocket Lab as a private company. They started with resources provided by Mark Rocket and Sir Michael Fay. Let me get ahead of you, you're going to see and hear some funny stuff. A last second delivery to Beck from a helicopter(no wonder he likes them so much). You'll also hear a guy say ""did it go?"" Judging by Beck's double fists in the air, it go'd. The tracking components they used were faulty, so it was never found. But being a sounding rocket you get literal evidence. 

I noticed a familiar double fists in the air during the last launch. Late in the stream a curly haired figure steps in to check if both satellites deployed nominally. Go to [1:13:45](https://youtu.be/PmCl2Hs8enc) and tell me I'm wrong.

Both these rockets are mainly built with carbon fiber. I have heard Beck say he only uses carbon fiber. First stage, second stage, fuel tanks, wherever he can. I don't know how they get the fuel tanks to work, but they do. 

So now here they are twelve years later with a wealth of knowledge on launching rockets to orbit. Working with the same material the whole time. Then learning how that material reacts on re-entry. I wrote this because I want to hear some discussion on the future possibilities of ""Rocket Lab Carbon Fiber.""

I think that was part of the hardware we got with the Neutron Presentation. I don't care that it wasn't bolted  down, or that it was at room temperature. A falling rocket isn't bolted down. So was the i-beam the one way to mimic forces from hypersonic waves? The fact they are sticking with CF makes me realize they are trying to learn from modern airplanes to make the modern day rocket. Two more things that weren't physical hardware, but interesting concepts were the fairings, and the suspended second stage. Sure the perfect end would be Beck stepping into some fairings that close....but whatcha gonna do

I'm trying to get a better understanding of composite materials and found [this old lecture](https://youtu.be/V7bX4c9XWes). I didn't make it through the whole thing, just the first part before the more technical discussion. He brings up a key advantage is ""tailorable anisotropy"", I was wondering how that could help in Neutrons design? As well as the ability to manipulate the overall process so many different ways. What do you think the limits are of the chemistry of the resin? 

I thought this professor did a great job in the early part of the lecture. He made it fairly easy to understand. It's also seven years old and he's talking about getting his own automated fiber placement machine. So that technology must be further along.",73,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/re8re1/12_years_later_and_some_things_never_change/

[Thomas Burghardt](https://twitter.com/TGMetsFan98) on twitter has noticed that Rocketlab has increased the length of the second stage of Electron.

[another older image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7b2GnMVgAEf5nd?format=jpg&name=large)

we know that the length of the fairing has increased, but if you look at the length of the umbilical connector for s2, it has also increased in length. I expect this to be mainly due the lengthening of s2, as lengthening of the firing should not need a higher umbilical connector, since that connector attaches at the base of the fairing (afaik)",74,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/quoml1/rocketlab_has_potentially_increased_the_length_of/

###Launch window:

The 10-day launch window opens on Friday, December 8, 2017, NZST. During this time a four-hour launch window will open daily from 2:30 p.m. NZDT (0130 UTC).

The test launch attempt will only proceed if conditions are ideal for launch. Due to the nature of launching rockets, planned lift-offs are often subject to multiple and subsequent postponements, or scrubs, to allow for small, technical modifications and to wait for ideal weather conditions.

Sources indicate that the customer is likely the Space Development Agency.," 

SDA, an organization under the U.S. Space Force, is building a mesh[ network of military satellites](https://spacenews.com/space-development-agency-renames-constellation-to-reflect-focus-on-u-s-warfighter/?preview_id=140632&preview_nonce=0118ef1bb4&preview=true&_thumbnail_id=141872) in low Earth orbit known as the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.

SDA Director Derek Tournear speaking at a conference earlier this month said the agency was negotiating a contract with an unspecified supplier for 18 satellites to expand the U.S. military low Earth orbit constellation.

One of the portions of SDA‚Äôs proliferated architecture is the [Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta](https://spacenews.com/space-development-agencys-data-transport-satellites-get-more-complex/), made up of communications satellites to enable beyond line-of-sight connectivity for military forces on the ground.¬†

Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta is projected to have 90 satellites. The agency in August announced it awarded $1.5 billion in contracts to Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman for 72 Beta satellites.

Tournear said Dec. 7 at a National Security Space Association event that SDA was planning to add another 18 Beta satellites to the constellation and was in negotiations with another vendor that he did not disclose.

The Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta satellites ‚Äî projected to launch in 2026 and 2027 ‚Äî will carry radios using the UHF (Ultra High Frequency) and S-band frequencies that military and intelligence units rely upon for voice and low-speed data transmissions.

‚ÄúWe are looking at putting another approximately 18 satellites on contract, and we‚Äôre working with a third vendor to do that, and we should make that announcement shortly,‚Äù Tournear said Dec. 7 at the NSSA forum.¬†

According to Rocket Lab‚Äôs SEC filing, the contract includes a base amount of $489 million, with incentives and options worth $26 million. ‚ÄúWork under the agreement will begin immediately with the delivery of the space vehicles to the customer for launch slated for 2027, operation of the satellites through 2030, and an option to operate the satellites through 2033.‚Äù

Cleverly naming rockets,"So I was thinking about how rocket companies are naming their rockets and I realized something. 

So Rocket Lab has the Electron rocket. Then they added a Photon upper stage. 
In atoms, when an Electron(rocket) is given enough energy it moves to a higher energy state (the upper atmosphere). 
The Electron then gives off a Photon(upper stage), which is then followed by the Electron falling back to its original energy state(the ground). 

The following is just some of my ideas to add to this family of rockets. I don't necessarily think Rocket Lab should or would make these rockets(mostly because they lead into medium lift launchers) since that would kinda defeat Rocket Labs current niche. And that these ideas are moreso ""built"" on the idea of clever naming not good rocket science.

One of my ideas to add onto the ""fundamental particle"" (maybe ""Atomic particle"" which is not quite true due to Photon, but that's neither here nor there) family of rockets would be for Rocket Lab to create a Proton(yes I know there is already a family of rockets names Proton) Rocket thats sole purpose is to be a booster for the Electron rocket for heavier payloads. The name of this combo rocket would then be named the Neutron rocket. For shits and gigs they could then(only for this specific rocket) rename the Photon kick stage to the Neutrino(more correctly Antineutrino but just Neutrino sounds better) kick stage. All of this is for the fact that in atoms that undergo beta decay, a Neutron changes to a Proton, which then releases an Electron as well as an (anti)Neutrino.

I found this incredibly entertaining and thought other people may as well. If anyone has any other ideas for clever rocket names please feel free to share them.

Edit: I added some of my ideas for future ""possible"" rockets",68,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/j1azmv/cleverly_naming_rockets/

Rocket Lab should have a fair fight for success,"I don‚Äôt want a political post and I don‚Äôt know how to make this not become political but it is what it is‚Ä¶.

I love what Rocket Lab is doing.  They are putting up satellites for lots of different companies from different countries.  Their work is having a large positive impact for employees in New Zealand and in the U.S.  They are walking the walk and not just talking the talk like a bunch of these other professed space companies.  It just irks me that as Beck is doing what needs to be done to be successful, the CEO of their biggest competitor met with a presidential candidate today who is asking for money.  You know if that happens there will be an understanding that SpaceX gets even more preferential treatment than anyone else.  Business success should be based on the hard work of the employees and not backdoor deals.  Keep up the good work Rocket Lab.  Can‚Äôt wait to see you on the moon.

Running out of Toes First Stage Returns to Wellington,"The Seaworker appears to arrived overnight in Wellington and I found the ship on my walk this morning. It was berthed at a private dock which is also used by BlueBridge to park cars waiting to board the 8am ferry sailing.  I attempted to take a close up photo within the private dock but a RocketLabs staffer on board told me to go away.  Unfortunately, I got locked in the dock area and the staffer then found me. After a friendly warning, they arranged to let me out (phew). They did confirm the first stage was onboard and that AIS (the shipping tracker) had been turned off after they left the Chatham Islands.  A launch was then unloaded and then Seaworker went for a cruise around the inner harbour (presumably waiting for the Rocketlabs' truck to arrive)  and the photo was taken from the Clyde Quay Wharf public lookout.

Interesting Discussion (RocketLab/Astra/Relativity Space),"Here¬¥s an interesting discussion mainly by Peter Beck (CEO of RocketLab), Chris Kemp (CEO of Astra), and Muhammad Shahzad (CFO of Relativity Space).

[https://youtu.be/\_1LQWJJOpOg](https://youtu.be/_1LQWJJOpOg)

&#x200B;

Here are the most interesting/important parts:

  

(60 seconds) Beck losing it about Kemp¬¥s initial thoughts on Astra:

&#x200B;

Some personal takeaways:

\-Beck seems like he doesn¬¥t like Kemp or Astra

\-Chris Kemp seems to be a very unsympathetic guy

\-Beck is the CEO/CFO likely feeling the most comfortable about his company and his decisions and thoughts being the most thought through

\-Shahzad being the CFO of Relativity Space probably wasn¬¥t their best guy for this discussion (Tim Ellis (CEO) would probably have been the better choice)

\-Financial guys are very Astra and Relativity Space focused while forgetting about the big winner in the room",64,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/pa9z5n/interesting_discussion_rocketlabastrarelativity/

If SpaceX is successful with Starship is that a positive for Rocket Lab?,"https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/

May seem like a odd question but I think it‚Äôs important to ask.  Now Rocket Lab‚Äôs Neutron rocket is not quite competing with Starship but rather the Falcon 9.  However if Starship is successful would that mean potential customers would go with Starship (or Falcon 9) versus Rocket Lab and Neutron? Is there enough demand for both company‚Äôs rockets ?  Is there enough differences to make them both needed?

Rocket Lab‚Äôs Next Mission to Launch 100th Satellite and Deploy Next-Generation Photon Spacecraft in Preparation for Moon Mission (mid-March),,60,1,https://www.rocketlabusa.com/about-us/updates/rocket-labs-next-mission-to-launch-100th-satellite-and-deploy-next-generation-photon-spacecraft-in-preparation-for-moon-mission/
New kick stage,"As I mentioned after looking at the press kit for this most recent flight, the kick stage seems to have changed -- it had a longer firing time than before.

Here's one writeup of what changed:

> [The Curie kick stage flown on Wednesday‚Äôs mission included a performance enhancement. The kick stage‚Äôs engine previously used a single ‚Äúgreen‚Äù non-toxic fuel ‚Äî a monopropellant system, in propulsion parlance ‚Äî while the upgraded engine is fed by a green bi-propellant mixture with a fuel and an oxidizer. // After releasing Astro Digital‚Äôs Palisade satellite, the Curie kick stage reignited to drop out of orbit, according to Rocket Lab.](https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/10/17/rocket-lab-delivers-on-dedicated-launch-for-astro-digital/)

The orbit was circular 1,200 km and the kick stage deorbited, so even with a relatively light satellite (16U == 25kg or so?) that's a lot of work for the kick stage. It didn't even wait for apogee to do the circularization or deorbit burns.

As a side comment, it would be nice if the launch history wiki would include orbit information.",61,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/djfqhr/new_kick_stage/

# Introduction

With the 2024 first launch of the Rocket Lab Mega Constellation Launcher‚ÄîThe Neutron‚Äîfast approaching, I decided it is high time for a more up-to-date DD on Rocket Lab. A lot is happening in the industry, the company, and the world. I have decided to dive into the future, fundamentals, industry, funding, financials, dreams, and of course, the memes of the aspiring space company. Now, I am posting my DD into both of the Rocket Lab subreddit, as I am new to writing DD and I want to hit as wide of an audience as I can. One disclaimer (for those who do not like stock talk), this DD is not meant to encourage buying of the stock, nor is it financial advice or a stock-only DD, I merely want to dive into this company and simply spark some discussion on it!

Now, Rocket Lab is a private aerospace manufacturer and small satellite launch service provider. The company was founded in 2006 by Peter Beck and is headquartered in Long Beach, California, with additional facilities in New Zealand and Australia. Rocket Lab specializes in the development and launch of small rockets capable of delivering payloads of up to 300 kilograms to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab‚Äîself-designated as a leader in launch and space systems‚Äîis a company that has a chance at becoming a highly profitable giant over the next decade and beyond. In my honest opinion, Rocket Lab currently thrives off of the crumbs of the current space industry ecosystem. With Space X increasingly focused upon one goal‚Äîthanks to their controversial, yet nevertheless, fearless leader‚Äîbeing Mars, Rocket Labs can (and in my opinion will) become one of the go-to space companies for low earth orbit launches in the near term and in the long-term become one of the go-to space company for launches between the Moon, Venus, and Mars as well. Rocket Lab currently lives off of the crumbs left behind by NASA, Space X, and the United States military-industrial complex.

[  Like these two legends from the movie War Dogs, Rocket Lab is determined to become the go-to space company for transporting all types of goods into orbit. For those of you who have not seen the movie \(I personally highly recommend it\), essentially, when these two start their arms-dealing company, they focus upon all of the small contracts that the government is putting out for arms supplies. The contracts that the big players are ignoring, due to their small sizes, even so, these small contracts are worth hundreds of thousands to low millions. Now, this is where Rocket Lab currently lies in the industry.](https://preview.redd.it/j6wloa05vd4b1.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fc5120309359cb8789b861e68009133ef92d376)

[ \\""A new space race has begun, and most Americans are not even aware of it. This race is not \[about\] political prestige or military power. This new race involves the whole human species in a contest against time.\\"" - Ben Bova ](https://preview.redd.it/iliovpg7vd4b1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=f22e8c01f45a403829c6c681966f1a9a53fab213)

Now, before I dive into everything here, I need every to understand that this industry is on the verge of immense change and rapid evolution. We are currently in the first stage of the world‚Äôs Second Space Race. As a student of History, I can confidently tell you that there are murmurings within the historical community, that this is the case, beginning with the creation and success of Space X‚Äôs first reusable rocket: the Falcon 9. On December 21st of 2015, when the first Falcon 9 was launched and the landing was successful with the first stage fully recovered, the race began. In the same way that there is no single company above all others in the airline, shipping & transportation, or car manufacturing industries, is the same reason I do not believe that Space X will alone run the space industry‚Äôs transportation needs. There is plenty of room for companies like Rocket Lab to fill the gaps Space X cannot and in a decade‚Äôs time, there will be plenty of room for even more companies. Yet, there are no companies that are even close to competing with Space X‚Äîother than Rocket Lab‚Äîat this time. Now, I won‚Äôt go deeply into most of these competitors in this deep dive, but to be short, Astra is on the verge of total failure, Virgin Galactic has been playing an entirely different game‚Äîspace tourism, which there is a massive market for, just perhaps won‚Äôt be penetrated by them‚Äîthey likewise seem to be failing. While Blue Origin has been playing a strong game and Space X an even stronger one, albeit more and more focused solely on Mars as the years go on.

[ Here you can see the 1-year charts of Rocket Lab, Astra, Virgin, and Boeing for reference, as you can see, these charts speak volumes. Rocket Lab has been having a tough year but has found a nice bottom and is consistently bouncing from lows in the $3.6-4 range. While Astra has been reduced to a penny stock, with their future unknown. Virgin Galactic is only maintaining below Rocket Lab‚Äôs share price, partly due to the large number of Retail investors that do not know much and refuse to let it die, coupled with a small hope that the company can recover in the coming years. Boeing is here for reference as to what a successful, large-cap company involved in a similar industry \(and the space industry as well\), should look like over the course of a decent year. ](https://preview.redd.it/4lgxhawavd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d24878b2d7dc72b1e5c87ccd01d67c077485001a)

*Now, there are a few assumptions that I am making that we need to cover before diving into the real DD:* Whether it be because we live in the beginnings of a second Space Race (fueled by privatized space companies and the world‚Äôs governments) or because of technological advancement and a rising interest in space, the increase in rocket launches, space development (in Earth‚Äôs orbit, the Moon, and Mars), and the lowering costs of space launches‚Ä¶ it will become exponentially cheaper, easier, and faster to launch into orbit and the industry as a whole will have a massive boom‚Äîakin, in a way, to the industrial revolution‚Äîover the mid-to-late 2020s into the early 2030s. With the mid-to-end 2030s and early 2040s, we will see massive developments in terms of low-Earth orbit manufacturing facilities, tourist destinations, and stations, as well as settlements on the Moon for mining and refueling for greater exploration and colonization of the Sol System as a whole.

Now these are in part assumptions, but I think once one does the research and looks at the fact, all of this is very achievable. Even if it does not occur in this way, you can shift the dates by an additional decade and every time you do, the more likely, easier, and cheaper it all becomes.

Rocket Lab's business model revolves around providing cost-effective and frequent access to space for small satellite operators. The company aims to simplify the process of deploying satellites by offering dedicated launches on its Electron rocket. Rocket Lab operates as an end-to-end service provider, handling the entire launch process from mission planning and payload integration to launch and on-orbit operations.

# Section 1: Rocket Lab Takes Flight! The Electron & the Neutron

[  ‚ÄòRocket Lab is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, complete spacecraft design and manufacturing, satellite components, flight software, and an on-orbit management.‚Äô ‚Äì Rocket Labs](https://preview.redd.it/nbt3cd8dvd4b1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc518b0149113dc115f082394c2b6e8b33e36707)

Rocket Lab's primary launch vehicle, the Electron, is a two-stage rocket powered by Rutherford engines, which use electric-pump-fed LOX/RP-1 propellants. The Electron is designed to optimize cost, flexibility, and rapid launch capability for small satellites. Rocket Lab has demonstrated numerous successful launches since its inaugural flight in 2017, showcasing its technological prowess and reliability. The small satellite market has been growing rapidly, driven by increased demand for data collection, communications, and Earth observation. Rocket Lab's focus on dedicated launches for small satellites positions it well to capture a significant portion of this expanding market. The company has already established a solid customer base, securing contracts with government agencies, research institutions, and commercial entities.

Rocket Labs‚Äîat the time of writing this‚Äîhas had 37 launches‚Äîwith a 91.89% success rate‚Äîdeployed 164 satellites, operates 3 launch pads, and is maintaining 3 Photon Satellites in the Earth‚Äôs orbit. Of the 164 satellites launched by Rocket Labs, they were commissioned to do so by a wide variety of clients, from NASA, Space Force, DARPA, to Canon. Rocket Labs is supported by Future Fund: Australia‚Äôs Sovereign Wealth Fund, Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Data Collective, Greenspring Associates, ACC, Promus Ventures, L One W One Ltd., and Lockheed Martin.

Rocket Lab‚Äôs main rocket, the Electron‚Äîbuilt and operated by Rocket Lab‚Äîhas flown 37 times and been successful 34 times, with only 3 failures. Rocket Lab‚Äôs key areas of business penetration lie in the launch of mid-sized service rockets, the manufacturing of space systems and satellites, and their adept ability to manufacture industrial space parts, applications, and proponents. The latter of which, they are sort of unopposed in terms of competition.

The Neutron‚ÄîRocket Lab‚Äôs medium-lift, mega constellation launcher‚Äîwill be able to launch 13,000 kilograms into low Earth orbit and it will be ‚Ä¶drum roll please‚Ä¶ reusable! The current goal is for it to launch in 2024. It will be designed for not only low earth orbital supply missions, but also deep space missions, and even human spaceflight. It will be fairing a design allowing for full reusability of the first stage and it will be lightweight, being made of Rock Lab‚Äôs own carbon composite structure. The home base for the Neutron will be at the Neutron Production Complex and the launch pad at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility and Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.

[ ‚ÄòThe Neutron Production Complex will be home to a rocket production, assembly, and integration facility, as well as a dedicated launch pad for the Neutron rocket located on the southern end of Wallops Island. The estimated 250,000 square foot state-of-the-art complex will be constructed on a 28-acre site adjacent to the Wallops Island Flight Facility and will include a Launch Control Center, Rocket Lab‚Äôs fifth global operations center for launch activities and on-orbit operations. To support rapid production of the Neutron rocket, current plans for the complex include automated fiber placement robotic production systems capable of laying up meters of Neutron‚Äôs new, specially formulated carbon composite structures in minutes. As a reusable rocket, Neutron is designed to land back on the Launch Complex 3 pad after a mission and from there it would be returned to the production complex for refurbishment and re-flight.‚Äô ](https://preview.redd.it/k592skwfvd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=279742c6d6196d860258d747af98f84e71b71470)

With Space X dominating large-load space orbital flight and transportation, Rocket Labs, in my honest opinion, is where Space X was roughly something like 6-8 years ago. While Rocket Lab intends to compete with Space X‚Äîwhether it will be considered competition in an industry this brand new and small, time will tell‚Äîfor cargo and humans to the low Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and even Venus! Space X and Elon Musk have made it abundantly clear that the goal of Space X is the large-scale settlement of Mars. While later models of Rocket Lab‚Äôs Neutron will be able to go to Mars and Venus, it appears that is not their main goal. In the near term (being the next two decades), they will be looking to dominate the low Earth orbit and Moon market as well as the manufacturing of industrial space parts, applications, and proponents.

# Section 2: The Space Industry & Company Fundamentals

Rocket Lab faces competition from other commercial launch providers, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. However, the company differentiates itself by specializing in small satellite launches, offering a tailored solution for this niche market. Rocket Lab's Electron rocket provides the advantage of dedicated launches and the flexibility to reach specific orbits, making it an attractive option for small satellite operators.

Rocket Lab has raised significant funding through various investment rounds, securing capital from venture capital firms, strategic partners, and government entities. Notable investors include Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Lockheed Martin. The company's ability to attract substantial investment indicates confidence in its business model and growth potential. Rocket Lab operates within the regulatory framework of the countries in which it launches its rockets. The company holds necessary licenses and approvals from government agencies, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Compliance with safety regulations and adherence to environmental guidelines are crucial aspects of Rocket Lab's operations.

Despite its achievements, Rocket Lab faces several risks and challenges. The space industry is highly competitive, and the success of the company depends on its ability to secure launch contracts and maintain a steady launch cadence. Regulatory changes, launch failures, or delays could impact Rocket Lab's operations and reputation. Additionally, the emergence of new technologies or market disruptors could pose a threat to the company's market position

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room, the Quarterly Results. To preface, negative quarterly results mean‚Äîpardon my French‚Äîjack-shit (at least in the short term) for a company such as Rocket Lab, that is looking at penetrating a market such as the space industry. We are going to look at the past four Quarterly Results in chronological order.

**Q2 2022 Report:** Rocket Lab achieved record revenue of $55.5 million, showing significant growth compared to the previous quarter (36% sequential growth) and the same quarter in the previous year (392% YoY growth). Despite the revenue growth, the company reported a negative EPS of $-0.08, indicating a net loss for the quarter.

**Q3 2022 Report:** Another record revenue was achieved, reaching $63.1 million, with a sequential growth of 14% and an impressive YoY growth of 1,093%. The company's EPS improved slightly to $-0.07 but still remained negative. The fourth quarter revenue is expected to be lower, ranging between $51 million and $54 million, as a launch customer's push extends into 2023.

**Q4 2022 Report:** The company's revenue for Q4 reached $51.8 million, showing a healthy year-over-year growth of 88%. The full-year revenue for fiscal 2022 amounted to $211 million, reflecting substantial growth of 239% compared to the previous year. The EPS remained negative at $-0.08.

**Q1 2023 Report:** The revenue for Q1 2023 was $54.9 million. Increasing revenue by 35% in the first quarter of 2023. Revenue from their launch business was $19.6 million, up $12 million from the prior quarter. Their EPS was $-0.08, indicating strong maintenance of their business. The second quarter is expected to show a significant revenue increase, with an estimated range of $60 million to $63 million.

Now, what does this all tell us? Firstly, they were very forthcoming with the quarterly expectations. Something one might think is not a big deal, but considering how a lot of publicly traded companies operate, this is a good thing. In each of their earnings reports, they have nearly exactly estimated their results, showing they are not attempting to mislead investors. The company has experienced impressive revenue growth throughout the reported quarters, indicating strong market performance and demand for its products/services. However, the negative EPS values suggest that the company is still operating at a net loss. From a shareholder‚Äôs perspective, the company's focus should be on achieving profitability and reducing the negative EPS, while maintaining consistent revenue growth. In my opinion, this stock is sitting just below a fair market value for what it is right now, sitting at just over $4, considering they are not fully profitable. Yet Rocket Lab continues to grow its business, making more contracts, and it stands a competitive chance. If they can turn a profit within 2-3 years, I think they will be one hell of a company. With their competitors failing left and right and none finding the success as Rocket Lab‚Äîother than Space X‚Äîthey could stand to be a massive company in a few decades, so massive, they‚Äôre bigger than Earth.

One last financial point to touch upon‚Ä¶ shorting, so here is some data, which is roughly one month outdated due to my difficulty in finding up-to-date information on the company without a Bloomberg Terminal (So, if anyone on the sub has access to a Bloomberg Terminal and would like to add to my DD in the comments, please do).

**Last Record Date:** May 15, 2023

**Outstanding Shares:** 478,660,000 shares

**Float Size:** 262,310,000 shares

**Short Percent of Float:** 9.80% (The short percent of float represents the percentage of shares available for trading that have been sold short).

**Average Trading Volume:** 4,044,396 shares

**Current Short Volume:** 25,710,000 shares

**Previous Short Volume:** 24,630,000 shares

**Change Vs. Previous Month**: +4.38%

**Dollar Volume Sold Short:** $111.58 million

**Short Interest Ratio / Days to Cover:** 7.7 (This ratio indicates the number of days it would take for the short sellers to cover their positions based on the average daily trading volume.).

The short interest in Rocket Lab has increased from the previous month, with a change of +4.38%. The short percent of the float is 9.80%, indicating that a significant portion of the available shares for trading has been sold short. Now, Rocket Lab‚Äôs short interest is relatively low for a company that has had consistent negative EPS and revenue. Showcasing that the big players in markets either A) believe this company will make a massive turnaround in the near future (1-3 years mark) or B) Rocket Lab, due to its size, is thankfully not on their radar. However, that said, the off-exchange short percentage is 57.69%, showcasing that A) public on-exchange short volume is a complete hoax and Hedge Funds, and other big players are beating down on the stock or B) all of this information is completely misrepresented to retail traders on purpose and the entirety of the United States market system is a complete farce.

# Section 3: Future Prospects & Big Moves

Rocket Lab has demonstrated strong performance and growth potential in the emerging small satellite launch market. The company continues to refine its launch processes, aiming to increase launch frequency and reduce costs further. Additionally, Rocket Lab has plans to develop a larger reusable rocket called Neutron, targeting the medium-lift market segment, which would expand its capabilities and market reach. The company has the potential to be the go-to company for low Earth orbital launches in the short term and in the long term, one of, if not the go-to company, for transportation to the Moon, Mars, and Venus.

[  Peter Beck, founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, did an interview last month on his take on the industry and their future prospects. I wanted to touch briefly on this \(you can find the video on YouTube\).](https://preview.redd.it/ced7t9iivd4b1.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=6579fcd100b405f44d1e65fb13cb185cefe6ed76)

Firstly, the video begins with the commentator stating, ""*With the Space Race this week*,"" the Space X rocket, the most powerful ever built, has scrubbed its launch. While Rocket Lab is adding a new service for testing hypersonic sub-orbital launches, being a welcome addition to the company‚Äôs wide array of services. Beck states that it is a very exciting time, stating that ‚Äú*the United States is kind of lacking behind in hypersonic technologies and this is a great opportunity to have high cadence, test flight environment for these payloads to really move forward the US‚Äôs hypersonic research*.‚Äù He goes on to talk about how these capabilities are essentially repurposed from Rocket Lab‚Äôs Electron Rocket capabilities: ‚Äú*We take a standard Electron orbital-class launch vehicle and we fly it in some really unique trajectories to provide these hypersonic trajectories‚Ä¶ it is taking an Electron and making a couple wee tweaks to it and having a great high frequency hypersonic testing platform that hasn‚Äôt existed*.‚Äù Beck goes on to speak on the launch cadence ‚Äú*being on target for 15 flights*‚Äù this year with the fastest turn around this year being 7 days between flights, saying ‚Äú*the machine is cranking and the vehicles are flying successfully and the last flight was a reusable vehicle and we splashed that down successfully and now we‚Äôre kind at the point where we are recycling and harvesting engines and components off of those launch vehicles and getting ready to put them back into service and re-fly them*.‚Äù He continues, stating, ‚Äú*I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm allowed to say exactly, but‚Ä¶ a whole multiple gambit of reused components that are all now re-entering the production line and going back into service*.‚Äù Morgan Brennan, the interviewer then speaks to how there is this emerging mismatch between supply and demand when it comes to the satellite launch market, with the fact that there are so many satellite constellations that are poised to go into orbit in the coming years and not enough capacity in terms of launching them. So, she then asks about the reusability of Electron and the development of the Neutron. Beck states that, ‚Äú*Electron is really serving that market very well, and there are lots of flight opportunities that are sort of just doing its thing, Neutron is the new flight opportunity for us‚Ä¶ 2026 to 2030 timeframe there is a massive deficit in launch and there are lots of constellations that are all really vying for an ability to get in orbit, so we saw that coming and started work on the vehicle and hopefully we can bring it into service in 2024 and really solve some of those problems and take advantage of that market opportunity*.‚Äù

Now, I don‚Äôt have to tell you all that this is very good to hear from Beck and this is very exciting, showcasing that he really believes Rocket Lab can penetrate this market and become a big player in the ever-evolving industry.

**Rocket Lab Making Big Moves Lately:**

¬∑ Bought Virgin Orbit HQ in California, this was a big win for the company, and folk on the sub were very excited to see this happen. Yay! But, sad and unfortunate for Virgin Galactic, which I am sure many of us space enthusiasts had higher hopes for, oh well, not everyone can achieve their dreams.

¬∑ Rocket Lab reached a new Company record of nine launches within a calendar year.

¬∑ Achieved a record of 100% mission success for Electron launches for the year.

¬∑ Successfully launched CAPSTONE mission to the Moon for NASA, including the first demonstration of Lunar Photon spacecraft platform.

¬∑ Successfully deployed two satellites to space for NASA‚Äôs TROPICS mission on the first of two dedicated launches on Electron for the constellation scheduled in May 2023.

¬∑ Secured another NASA mission to Electron‚Äôs 2023 launch manifest with its Starling mission. Rocket Lab was selected by NASA to launch the Starling mission on an expedited timeline due to long delays and uncertainty with the mission‚Äôs original launch provider.

¬∑ Signed multiple new launch contracts on Electron for 2023 for undisclosed commercial satellite customers previously manifested on another small launch vehicle, demonstrating Electron‚Äôs strong position as a reliable and dependable ride to orbit for small satellite operators.

¬∑ Introduced Rocket Lab‚Äôs new HASTE launch vehicle, a suborbital testbed launch vehicle derived from the Company‚Äôs Electron rocket to provide reliable, high-cadence flight test opportunities to support the development of advanced hypersonic systems technology.

¬∑ Announced that the Company will fly a pre-launched 3D printed Rutherford engine on an upcoming mission in Q3‚Äô23, a major step in evolving the Electron launch vehicle into a reusable rocket.

¬∑ Delivered financial results that exceeded the high end of prior guidance for revenue and gross margin.

¬∑ Launched three successful Electron missions in the first quarter for commercial constellation operators HawkEye 360, Capella Space, and BlackSky.

¬∑ Successfully completed the Company‚Äôs first launch from its U.S. launch site, Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2, at the Virginia Spaceport Authority‚Äôs Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on January 24, 2023. The mission deployed three satellites for radio frequency geospatial analytics provider HawkEye 360.

¬∑ Successfully completed the Company‚Äôs fastest turnaround between launches to date ‚Äì just seven days between its 34th Electron launch, ‚ÄúStronger Together‚Äù, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 in Virginia on March 16, 2023, and its 35th Electron launch, ‚ÄúThe Beat Goes On‚Äù, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand on March 24, 2023.

¬∑ Rocket Lab remains the only U.S. commercial small launch provider to successfully deliver satellites to orbit in 2023. Secured a multi-mission contract with Capella Space to launch four more dedicated launches on Electron in 2023.

¬∑ Achieved programmatic milestones for the Company‚Äôs two Photon spacecraft to support NASA‚Äôs ESCAPADE mission to Mars, and for the Photon spacecraft for a Varda Space Industries‚Äô mission to manufacture high-value products in zero gravity. Both Photon programs include Rocket Lab star trackers, reaction wheels, solar panels, flight software, and radios ‚Äì demonstrating the value and strength of the Company‚Äôs vertical integration and in-house supply chain.

# Conclusion: An Ode to Humanity's Future

Rocket Lab has established itself as a leading player in the small satellite launch market, offering dedicated launch services tailored to the needs of small satellite operators. The company's technological capabilities, solid customer base, and innovative approach position it well for future growth.

Those who lived and grew up in the 1960s and 1970s believed that by the 21st century, mankind would be a space-faring civilization. People had a fascination with the unknown. It was embedded in pop culture, in movies like the 2001 Space Odyssey, Alien, and the Star Trek series. But the unfortunate truth is that after Apollo 17 on the 19th of December 1972, mankind has not left low-earth orbit. The American public lost interest, the government cut funding, and the Saturn V rockets were dismantled and replaced by space shuttles in the 1980s (spaceships not even built to leave low-earth orbit). The curiosity and desire to unravel the mystery of the universe are now again filling the hearts of people. Technology is becoming more advanced and cheaper.

With companies like Rocket Lab and Space X, the future is looking bright. We currently live in an era of mass information. One of the hardest aspects of life in the early-21st-century is learning how to filter all this information. The news of the accomplishments of Rocket Lab, Space X, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA), the European Space Agency (ESA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Space Force, are lost in the large volume of collective data. The average person does not believe how close we are to colonizing Luna and Mars; how close we are to becoming a multi-planetary species. If you walked up to someone on the street of New York City, today, and told them that in the mid-2040s, and by the latest, the 2050s, there will be hundreds if not thousands of people living in Earth's orbit, the upper atmosphere of Venus, the Moon, and Mars, the person would dismiss you in disbelief. But the same would have happened if you walked up to a person on the street of New York City on the 19th of July 1962 (before Kennedy‚Äôs speech) and told them that mankind would step foot on the moon in seven years. Companies like Rocket Lab, which will make orbital flight and transportation affordable, will allow for a new era of civilization, one which was only present and dreamed of in science fiction of the past.

[The Earth, as imaged from the Voyager 1 spacecraft, was suspended in a sunbeam, as the interstellar craft exited the Sol system in 1990. Earth is nearly 4 billion miles away in this image. That is us. That is humanity, all of us that have thus far, ever existed. We take to the stars in search of not only answers but in search of a purpose.](https://preview.redd.it/hnr23odlvd4b1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=298a1ee80b0bc5e3dc0ba5c3c61aa6a25c0682c1)

Neutron launching Kuiper Satellites for Amazon?,"Hi All,

I was thinking, what are the chances for Amazon awarding launch contract to RocketLab Neutron for its Kuiper Satellites?

RocketLab is already going to deliver reaction wheels (2-3K a year) for Kuiper. RocketLab also recently launched a high-volume star tracker (maybe also for Kuiper). All in all, seems like RocketLab is going to do a lot of work for Kuiper. Then why not launch also?

Amazon did sign launch contracts with Vulcan Centaur (ULA), New Glenn (BO) and Ariane 6 (ArianeSpace). All these medium to heavy lift launch vehicles are delayed and won't see a multiple launch cadence before 2025/2026. It is even questionable whether ULA and ArianeSpace can achieve a high launch cadence as their vehicles are expendable.

Amazon Kuiper is in a hurry to catch up with starlink, so they do not really have the luxury to wait. Therefore, I think there a good chances that RocketLab will get launch contracts from Amazon Kuiper. Neutron could potentially launch 4 or more times in 2025 and then scale rapidly from there i.e. providing Amazon Kuiper with better performance than all of the current launch contract holders.

A Neutron rocket could put roughly 18 Kuiper satellites (700kg per satellite) in orbit per launch at a price of $50 million. $ per kg will definitely be lower than with Vulcan Centaur and Ariane 6.

## What is going to be on board for this flight?

Electron will deploy three satellites for radio frequency
geospatial analytics provider HawkEye 360. The
mission will be the first of three Electron launches for

## What is going to be on board for this flight?

The primary payload aboard this mission includes nine of the latest generation SuperDove satellites from Planet, the operator of the world‚Äôs largest
constellation of Earth-imaging satellites. Each of the nine SuperDoves in Flock 4e‚Äô will be integrated with and deployed from Rocket Lab‚Äôs Maxwell
dispensers, the industry‚Äôs lightest CubeSat dispenser in its class. Planet‚Äôs constellation provides medium-resolution global coverage that enables
researchers, students, businesses and governments to discover patterns, detect early signals of change, and make timely, informed decisions

Canon Electronics Inc.‚Äôs CE-SAT-IIB, was procured by satellite rideshare and mission management provider Spaceflight Inc. The mission objective
for the CE-SAT-IIB satellite is a technical demonstration microsatellite developed with a middle-size telescope equipped with an ultra-high
sensitivity camera to take night images of the Earth and small size telescopes which are suitable for CubeSat use.

Neutron crew capabilities,"Another poster in another subreddit stated that Neutron could put the weight of Soyuz into LEO and it got me thinking.  I hadn't considered that Rockelab could possibly straight up buy brand new Soyuz capsules from Energia to bootstrap Rocketlab's own human spaceflight program.

Russian engine manufacturer NPO Energomash has been selling Russian engines around the world for decades. China's Shenzhou human spacecraft is largely based off Soyuz. So its apparent that Russia has no problems selling their spaceflight hardware and designs to other nations. Additionally, engine sales and Soyuz seat sales are on the decline so Russia's spaceflight sector maybe more willing to do something like selling whole Soyuz to make up the budget shortfalls.

Soyuz capsule has a long heritage of successful work and it would allow Rocketlab to leapfrog into a whole new business of space tourism and possibly even go after future NASA Commercial Crew contracts.  Further cutting development time, there are hundreds of trained Soyuz pilots and commanders that are veterans of spaceflight in a number of government space programs around the world.

Will rocket lab make weapons?,"So normally I don't care that much about morals generally and I am aware that companies like lockheed martin don't give a flying sh\* wether I buy a stock or not. Humans get bombed (or not bombed) regardless wether peasants like me buy a stock. I understand that it makes no difference, but still I don't think its moral to invest in stocks that build weapons. So I wanted to buy rocket lab stocks and I am wondering are they planning to make weapons in the near future? Or will they stick to peaceful space stuff?

Edit: With weapons I am specifically referring to bombs or other devices designed to activly hurt or kill people. I am not talking about missiles in general. Also I don't care about it if the rockets accidently crash and hurt the environment. The earth will certainly carry on without us. However I think its immoral to take away life, as in killing humans. Therefor (and thats just personal, not judging investors) I don't want to invest in stocks that build weapons (specifically bombs or WoMD designed to kill humans). Excluding explosives that are not used to harm humans (nuking an asteroid flying towards earth or exploding a mountain to mine diamonds). I just don't want my invested money used to actively hurt other people. However I don't care about espionage, cars and engines that hurts the environment or climate change or something like that. As I said my morals are not high. Its just that I draw the line at bombing people. I know its irrational, but thats just how I think.

Rocket Lab generating negative revenue on Electron Launches?,"Hey, so I'm part of a small investor group on Discord which follows space stocks. Recently one of our members [revealed that Rocket Lab is operating electron launches at a net loss](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/998003492503421018/1005151082512662588/IMG_0619.png?width=1200&height=301). He came to this conclusion after digging around in the quarterly earnings reports which report revenues and expenses related to launches and then counted the number of launches in that quarter by referring to Rocket Lab's [completed missions](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/) page. Now obviously, this may not be entirely unexpected for a company that is still relatively new. However, I find the lack of transparency regarding this issue concerning. Investors should not have to go to this level of detail just to uncover that a company is generating negative returns on launches. Obviously, they are generaing revenues from their subsidiary companies as well as the sales of [reaction wheels](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/space-systems/satellite-components/reaction-wheels/) and [star trackers](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/space-systems/satellite-components/star-trackers/). Hopefully, as launch cadence improves and re-usability becomes more streamlined, the company may end up breaking even. Don't get me wrong, I love what Rocket Lab does (it's amazing), but I just feel a little.. annoyed that Peter Beck hasn't stated that they are generating negative revenues from the launches.

&#x200B;

Additional information regarding calculations:

1. CoR = Cost of Revenue r/L = Revenue per launch CoR/L = Cost of Revenue per Launch
2. \*\*\*\[***4:33 AM***\]\*\*\*I don‚Äôt know what was going on in Q3 21\` so I pulled that out of the margin calculation, since it felt like an outlier. With that in, margin would have obviously been MUCH lower.

Rocket Lab competitor with 40% cheaper bio fuel? Blushift,"Not a expert in this subject matter but there is a company out there call blushift that uses bio fule instead of traditional fuel use by other Rocket companies. 

The fuel is  made from farms and it‚Äôs 40% cheaper than traditional fuel. They said it was easy to make

The bio fuel is very environmentally firendly. If you drink it, it will not cause any major pain. It will not pollute the planet like traditional fuel

They test out the bio fuel and it‚Äôs just as powerful or more powerful than the traditional fuel used by other Rocket company

They did a commercial sub oribital on January 31 2021 to test the bio fuel engine, and it was successful 

Now they are crowdfunding $1 million on Wefunder to develop the MAREVL engine to help them reach orbit. 

Surprise they only need $1 million to start development such new technology using bio fuel. Rocket Lab used $100 million for electron. 

Actually they move so fast that they will start testing the MAREVL in stepember THIS year.

Blushift might be Rocketlab little step brother lol

Rocket Lab scraps air-reusability captures in favor of water retrievals.,"Rocket Lab has announced during conference call for Q4 2022 results that it intends to pursue water-based recovery of electron first stages instead of air-reusability captures. Further update was provided by Adam SPice a couple weeks ago who confirmed that last air capture failure due to a loss of telementary was caused due to a failure of one of the paracutes attached to the electron first stage.

Then, suddenly it's 11 weeks between November 4th and January 24th. Now, it's been another 5 weeks and still no next launch announced.

Why is this? According to their earnings call today, they have a full Backlog, lot's of missions, and more than enough cash at hand. Electron works reliably. They have two launch sites. Why ain't they launching twice a month?

How will Rocket Lab deal with this new tech that is being developed?

Photon will need an upgrade to be a servicer tug, better engine, and robotic arm. Instead of pumping fuel, I like quick exchange of fuel tanks, less mess. This means someone has to build a tank farm in several orbital planes.

Building satellites  on orbit may give Electron new life, ferrying new components to old satellites. Reaching GEO with the weight/ mass of a big reaction wheel may be out of reach, but new sensors should be doable.

I have a lingering thought. For Neutron reusability, where is the hop test vehicle? And if it is partially built, why has Rocket Lab not shared it's progress? Electron's 1st stage ability to come back to an area above the ocean via parachutes, to then be caught by a helicopter, was an interesting idea that never materialized. Bringing Neutron back to the Wallops pad, at a precise location, is much more challenging. And doing that landing on a floating barge is much more difficult. Why no word on the barge build?

Launching Electron from a Mountain,"So with the next launch by Rocket Lab hopefully later today, i thought about if it might be beneficial to have a launch site on top of a mountain. 

For the purpose of discussion lets say you build a launch complex in Hawaii on top of a 4000+ m mountain. There are roads to service the telescopes that are up there, so transport of building material and eventually the rocket itself shouldn't be a major problem.

A launch from up there should give you a noticeable increase in payload capability, since drag and gravity losses should be somewhat reduced. Does anyone know by how much? 

I am also aware of the dangers of such a launch profile. With water nowhere nearby, you cannot easily control your evacuation zone. Espacially on Hawaii, coastal areas will be inhabited and in case of a RUD these people might be in danger. 

But if Electron is proven to be reliable (after maybe ~100 flights), could this be considered as an option for the future if the payload increase is significant enough to eventually justify the expenses for Rocket Lab?

I hope what I'm thinking doesn't happen,"I have a theory about why Blue Origin might finally cancel the launch of the Rocket Lab probes.

It was recently revealed that Blue Origin had applied for a license from the FAA to ship the Blue Moon MK1 in March 2025. (https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueOrigin/comments/1eqf17f/blue\_moon\_mk1\_pathfinder\_net\_march\_2025/)

A few days ago Bloomberg revealed that the hardware of the second and third New Glenn ship had been damaged in internal company tests, if the report is accurate, BO only has a single New Glenn ship tested and ready to fly, with the urgency of BO to demonstrate their lunar rover for missions to NASA while Starship is in development, they may have their internal interests as priority. (https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/08/21/bezos-blue-origin-suffers-fiery-setback-building-new-rocket/)

Let us remember that the probes that Rocket Lab has manufactured are launch class D, low-cost and these can be delayed, since they are not an urgent priority like classes A and B would be.

These are my thoughts, maybe I'm wrong and everything is ready for launch, but if Blue Origin decides in the end that they will not be able to meet the schedule for the window, it is possible that they are considering this path of prioritizing their lunar module since they are very profitable missions that NASA spends a lot of money

Let's just imagine... what happens to Rocket Lab post-contact from Aliens?,"I know it is a taboo subject with a million different theories or beliefs. With all the congress hearings lately claiming UAPs are real, they are here, they hypothesize how they work within our understanding of physics but all agree the technology is not ours.

Let's just play pretend and all of that is 100% real and all of a sudden some alien race made contact and we got access to their gravitational propulsion technology, and are able to travel between our atmosphere, space, other planets, etc all very fast.

Does Rocket Lab just immediately become obsolete and tank? I suppose even if we don't need launch vehicles like rockets, the satellite components business would still be in full operation and working.

Or maybe it is a massive catalyst in humanity's drive for space and motivation to become interplanetary. All of a sudden rocket launches and satellites are #1, 2 and 3 priority and get massive attention and funding.

Time for Rocket Lab to re-consider air-captures?,"So, given that the last two air-capture attempts both ended in failure, I feel it might be time for Rocket Lab to re-consider it's re-usability program.

This suggests that air captures may in fact be unnecessary and instead of further promoting the company to investors, it is actually acheiving the opposite effect due to the [negative media coverage](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/04/business/rocket-lab-helicopter-booster-catch-scn/index.html). My personal recommednation would be to cancel the air-capture attempts and retreive all future booster stages from the ocean using the retreival vessel. This avoids putting lives at undue risk for publicity purposes while still enabling the company to re-use the first stage engines. The helicopters can be re-tasked to spot the landing locations of the booster stages for the retrieval vessel.",0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/yme706/time_for_rocket_lab_to_reconsider_aircaptures/

But there is also a group of startups that are not interested in building rockets, because they are clear that they cannot compete with the main 3, so they are dedicating their efforts to trying to offer other services related to payload, saleslites, software, among others. . services that may arise, but we will not talk about them, we will focus on SpaceX, Blue Origin and Rocket Lab, which is what is expected of them in the coming years and this is where I want to make it clear that it is my perception that I will say to below and this may not happen as I will say.

To begin with, I think that SpaceX and Blue Origin have some points in common, not only does it have a strong backing of money, but its CEOs are people with certain power, who may have certain ties with politicians, this in some way . may influence certain future government contracts.

As for Rocket Lab, it is a company that comes from nowhere and is making its way with its own resources, this is where I want to remain skeptical, I don't know if Rocket is aware that it can be very difficult to compete directly with these 2 companies in the future, maybe I'm wrong, but I have the feeling that Rocket Lab will eventually focus on offering services like the other startups they mention at the beginning want to do and will slowly abandon rockets.

Why doesn't Electron system use catenary wire supply to rocket during early flight?,"I wonder if RocketLab should use wires to supply juice from terrestrial source to the rocket's pumps during the first few seconds of flight when the engines are working the hardest? (If I understand correctly, space rockets toil almost half of their total work during the first 10 seconds / 500 meters altitude of flight.) Thus the burden on on-board battery packs could be significantly lessened via wire-based electric supply. E.g. how the 1950s era french sounding rocket ""Veronique"" used 4 steel wires attached to its fins (albeit for early flight trajectory stabilization instead of HV AC or DC supply).

The tech is mature, as railway overhead catenary carries 16MW of power at 25kV AC to electric locomotives worldwide and some mining railways even use 50kV AC. As an alternative, 30kV DC has recently been developed, though not yet used in railways (where current DC wire max is 3kV).

In case of 25 or 50kV, 50/60Hz AC supply the electric ""skin effect"" even means most of the juice only flows through the outer parts of the wire, near the surface and thus it could be made hollow, with a super-strong synthetic filament in the middle to provide strenght, while a thin copper or silver skin conducts the current, to keep the weight burden manageable.

Wires on the rocket should also help with proliferation concerns, since the current, autonomously powered Electron seems oddly the right size and weight to be put on a 14x14 all-terrain truck russian style and lofted at your foe from a random location as an IRBM/ICBM. If it depended on wires carrying juice from the grid during the beginning of its flight, implying military un-feasibility, then other launch locations could be more easily authorized worldwide.",15,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/idv0uq/why_doesnt_electron_system_use_catenary_wire/

However, it has been [awared a contract by the U.S Space Force to develop the Neutron upper stage worth approx 24.35 million](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-wins-24m-u-s-space-force-contract-to-develop-neutron-upper-stage/). It seems from this that Rocket Lab has already missed out on a number of cruicial launch contracts from the commercial space sector. Though they have been recognised by the U.S Space Force and with their recent Electron launches for the NRO, it is possible that Neutron may be selected as the go-to for the defense sector in the United States. With rising geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and now Taiwan, it would not surprise me if the majority of Neutron's launches were comprised of defense contracts provided by the U.S Space Force, NRO and possibly others.",26,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wlist1/neutron_could_endup_becoming_the_goto_for_defense/
Duel Citizenship rocket lab,Am I eligible to get a job if I have both New Zealand and Malaysian citizenship?,7,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wj31to/duel_citizenship_rocket_lab/
"Has Rocket Lab ever discussed the possibility of creating an ""upperstage(s)"" version of the Electron, to be sold (especially for NASA probe missions, for ex.) as a cheaper alternative to the Centaur, on other medium/heavy lift rockets? I did some delta-v calcs and the results looked pretty good.","Ideally, they would make it shorter and wider for this version, since it would be sitting on top of the first 1, or 2 stages of a medium-lift or heavy-lift rocket.  

(There could also be a 1 stage version that deletes what on a normal Electron would be the electron's upper stage, or vice versa, I guess, depending what size of rocket they were sitting this thing onto).

One important thing to keep in mind is: the dry mass of what would be the first stage of a normal Electron rocket, would be lightened considerably by the fact that they could probably remove 7, or maybe even 8 of the 9 rutherford engines (remember, it would be being used as a 3rd stage, so, it would already be most of the way, or already in LEO by this point, so, it wouldn't need the full 9 engines on that stage, nor anywhere near it, AND, better yet, that also means you'd get to remove 7/9ths or 8/9ths of battery mass, as well.

And, also don't forget we'd be using vacuum-optimized rutherford(s) for that 1st (3rd) stage electron stage, so we get the 343 isp figure, not the 300ish figure, for the burn.

So considering how light it is, being made out of carbon fiber, and then lightened even further more of a bunch of dry mass from getting rid of 78% to 89% of its engine & battery mass from that stage, its dry weight would be EXTREMELY low, so even when combined with a 'mere' 343 isp, it actually would perform extremely well.  Getting into Centaur performance territory, at a much cheaper price.

The one thing I'm not as sure about is on the technical side, pragmatically, like, is the Centaur easier, or harder to work with, as a high upperstage, during the part where the thing is sitting on the launch pad, and also even during the launch while it is waiting to get ignited like 8 minutes later or whatever?  On the one hand, I would assume, at first glance, that the Centaur is, if anything, *worse* in this regard, having to deal with nasty ole near-absolute-zero liquid hydrogen and whatnot.  BUT, I'm a noob and have no experience with any of this, so, for all I know, it's some counterintuitive situation where because they use a bunch of insulation liner in hydrogen stages, maybe this somehow makes it weirdly easier to use in terms of boiloff or something, compared to a kerolox upper-upperstage?  Not sure.

And there would be the question of how the payload fairing situation would work.  I.e. would they slip basically a shortened, fattened Electron (minus 7 or 8 rutherfords and batteries) literally just into the payload fairing (i.e. of something like a Falcon9 or FalconHeavy, and just have some weird little holes punched into the bottom (down-facing-curve part of the bottom of the fairing to put the tubes into to deal with propellant and boiloff?

Or, would it need to be more like its own more formal stage, with the bottom-Electron stage being its own cylinder-section, so to speak, near the top of the rocket, along with an even smaller one of what would amount to its upperstage, with a little payload fairing sitting on top of that?

I guess it would be simpler if using just the bottom of the two electron stages, for a 3-stage setup, rather than both stages for a *four* stage setup.

And, if a customer was trying to do a New Horizons style mission and wanted to eek out every last drop of delta-V, but didn't want the nuissance of the tiny liquid-fuel Electron uppermost stage, they could just replace that stage with one of those Thiokol 37Y or 48B stages I guess (although not sure if the prices on those are super unreasonable or not, considering those are linked to old-space stuff, and I've never seen price tags for what those cost.

---------------------------------------------

**Some delta-V estimates, if it was used for various F9 configurations:**

Falcon 9 in ASDS reusable mode can put 15.6 metric tons into LEO.

If you were launching a New Horizons type of deep space probe (or maybe a small probe to some moon of Jupiter or Neptune or whatever), and let's say it weighed about 478kg (the mass of New Horizons):

F9 in reusable mode could easily put both stages of electron + the payload with a few thousand kgs left over to spare, into LEO.

And then you'd get a whopping **additional 8,973** m/s of delta-V from the Electron's stages, for about 7 million bucks, combined with the cheapness of a resuable-mode F9 launch (also cheap, compared to the expendable launchers).  (And, remember, I removed 7 out of the 9 rutherfords and 7/9ths of the battery mass, for the lower of the two Electron stages, for my calculations since it's being used as uppstages here.  Aka if your numbers come out a little lower, that's the reason why (I used 35kg per Rutherford and 20.857kg (it was listed in lbs somewhere) per battery; all times 7x on both accounts for a grand total of 391 kgs of dry mass shaved from that stage, from removing 7/9ths of the engines + batteries.

I also did a fully expendable F9 + Electron stages calculation (and shaved about 2,600kg of dry mass from the from the F9 1st stage since no landing legs, fins, etc and turned that into propellant mass), to see how much total delta-V it would give to a 478kg New Horizons probe, and if anyone is curious, it came out to:
**19,705 m/s of delta-V**

Obviously with the Falcon Heavy the numbers get even crazier, by several thousand m/s of delta-V.

For that version if using a small probe, you could go the full 4 stages and get extremely high delta-V, or, you could use only the bottom of the two Electron stages, as the third stage, and leave out the 4th stage, if going with a somewhat bigger probe (maybe a lander that weighs a few thousand KGs, let's say) and get some vastly improved numbers out of, say, a Falcon Heavy in reusable or reusable+expendable-centercore mode, with only a few million extra in added price.

The problem, in regards to specifically the Falcons, is that they are already so skinny, that adding even more height with this would maybe push it over the edge (I think as long as Rocket Lab created a short-and-fat upperstage-use version, though, it would actually be okay (albeit just barely).

And then, not sure if the old-space companies that launch the Atlas (or later on, Vulcan) or Antares or stuff like that would even *want* the discounted upperstage performance or not.  Like maybe they have some special old space deals in place or something where they *must* use a centaur, or what have you, as an upperstage, and specifically NOT try to save money by going this route.

But maybe Russia, China, ESA, India, JAXA, would be willing to buy this kind of upperstage for their rockets, even if U.S. oldspace didn't want to?

Not sure.

Moat chat,"First off this ain't a DD. This is a motivational wake up to what is actually happening. 


Every month that rocketlab is running, is the moat.


This ain't a 7/11 franchise. This is a business that has all the knowledge and engineering to get to space. Every day, every week, every month something new is learned that gives them an edged. All the layers beyond just a rocket, rocketlab already is refining and gaining new plans and partnerships.


All their previous launches, all that experience, gaining customers, a proven track record, refining, adapting, tweaking, integrating. Rocketlab building parts, building platforms, launching, monitoring, landing, building a process, refining a process.


The amount of experience, retaining customers, providing new experiences and solutions for customers...


...that is the moat. Doing the hard thing, doing it well, and most importantly already doing it. There isn't hopium, there isn't promises, they are already doing it.


Others haven't even scratched the surface of what that all entails. They don't have all the additional staff, processes, customers, solutions, platforms, they are stuck on figuring out step one. They are blowing millions, billions, without even a foundation of a business yet.


Rocketlab is so far ahead that they have a wild tech/intelligence/platform moat that is still far unrealized compared to their stock worth.


I am actually incredibly excited because a lot of this is still to be discovered by others. You really need to grasp how much rocketlab has already accomplished and how fast they are moving on neutron and space systems. Like, this ain't a shop that sells loaves of bread(nothing against a good sour dough, promise). They made a business that escapes the atmosphere, literally leaving the planet to find new opportunities. That is something once only held by the wealthiest and most knowledgable countries. Now we have it from rocketlab, where we individually have the ability, through its stock, to be a part of it. Literally nerd heaven.


Owning some rocketlab stock puts us right there in time, in the history of humanity where we are transitioning to space. Like imagine what you can tell your kids, nephews and neices or grand kids.


The wonderful thing is, you don't even have to imagine, you just do it, and you are a part of all this. Own a piece of this awesomeness. Help make sure it all happens, promote it, champion it. 


I just don't even know what else to say!!! It's so damn exciting.

Downward revision for Q2 launches?,"Hey everyone.

Ahead of earnings I've been doing some research. I'm fairly ok with this quarter earnings meeting the targets of 98m assuming the space system forecast was accurate. Traditionally they've been pretty close so maybe +/- 1m but overall they've had all successful launches done.

My issue is for the upcoming quarter. Didn't they guide for like 6 launches this quarter? And more so for the entire year it was around 22/24. I really don't think this seems feasible right now. 

A possible downwards revision in launches in the guidance could be bearish news for this stock right? We could take a big hit that basis?

A delay/downwards revision in launches is either due to the fault of customers not having satellites ready to go or just a big lag between when Rocket lab get the electron rockets ready for launch.

The other side is the good news which could be them saying they'd be able to hit the target launches and possible news of neutron.",8,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1chca1w/downward_revision_for_q2_launches/

This will surely be a Killer App for SpaceX's upcoming Starship launch vehicle, deploying their upcoming Starlink v2 satellites into orbit. There will surely be a demand for this type of communication network if it works as advertised, fulfilling the promise of what Iridium was supposed to be.

I was wondering whether Rocket Lab with its own in-house expertise from its family of satellite component builders might be able to come up with a comparable solution as this. Something like that would surely create demand for Neutron's launch services, especially with the rapid launch turnaround Neutron is meant for.

So Neutron obviously won't have a fairing as large as Starship's, but could some of the well-known origami techniques be used to create large unfolding antenna arrays that could snugly fit into Neutron's payload fairing for launch? Elon Musk said Starlink v2 would be using the world's most advanced Phased Array antennae, which could both detect the comparatively weaker signals from cellphones and compensate for Doppler frequency shift. Is anything like that within the capabilities of Rocket Lab or its family of subsidiary companies?

# Introduction

With the 2024 first launch of the Rocket Lab Mega Constellation Launcher‚ÄîThe Neutron‚Äîfast approaching, I decided it is high time for a more up-to-date DD on Rocket Lab. A lot is happening in the industry, the company, and the world. I have decided to dive into the future, fundamentals, industry, funding, financials, dreams, and of course, the memes of the aspiring space company. Now, I am posting my DD into both of the Rocket Lab subreddit, as I am new to writing DD and I want to hit as wide of an audience as I can. One disclaimer (for those who do not like stock talk), this DD is not meant to encourage buying of the stock, nor is it financial advice or a stock-only DD, I merely want to dive into this company and simply spark some discussion on it!

Now, Rocket Lab is a private aerospace manufacturer and small satellite launch service provider. The company was founded in 2006 by Peter Beck and is headquartered in Long Beach, California, with additional facilities in New Zealand and Australia. Rocket Lab specializes in the development and launch of small rockets capable of delivering payloads of up to 300 kilograms to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab‚Äîself-designated as a leader in launch and space systems‚Äîis a company that has a chance at becoming a highly profitable giant over the next decade and beyond. In my honest opinion, Rocket Lab currently thrives off of the crumbs of the current space industry ecosystem. With Space X increasingly focused upon one goal‚Äîthanks to their controversial, yet nevertheless, fearless leader‚Äîbeing Mars, Rocket Labs can (and in my opinion will) become one of the go-to space companies for low earth orbit launches in the near term and in the long-term become one of the go-to space company for launches between the Moon, Venus, and Mars as well. Rocket Lab currently lives off of the crumbs left behind by NASA, Space X, and the United States military-industrial complex.

[  Like these two legends from the movie War Dogs, Rocket Lab is determined to become the go-to space company for transporting all types of goods into orbit. For those of you who have not seen the movie \(I personally highly recommend it\), essentially, when these two start their arms-dealing company, they focus upon all of the small contracts that the government is putting out for arms supplies. The contracts that the big players are ignoring, due to their small sizes, even so, these small contracts are worth hundreds of thousands to low millions. Now, this is where Rocket Lab currently lies in the industry.](https://preview.redd.it/j6wloa05vd4b1.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fc5120309359cb8789b861e68009133ef92d376)

[ \\""A new space race has begun, and most Americans are not even aware of it. This race is not \[about\] political prestige or military power. This new race involves the whole human species in a contest against time.\\"" - Ben Bova ](https://preview.redd.it/iliovpg7vd4b1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=f22e8c01f45a403829c6c681966f1a9a53fab213)

Now, before I dive into everything here, I need every to understand that this industry is on the verge of immense change and rapid evolution. We are currently in the first stage of the world‚Äôs Second Space Race. As a student of History, I can confidently tell you that there are murmurings within the historical community, that this is the case, beginning with the creation and success of Space X‚Äôs first reusable rocket: the Falcon 9. On December 21st of 2015, when the first Falcon 9 was launched and the landing was successful with the first stage fully recovered, the race began. In the same way that there is no single company above all others in the airline, shipping & transportation, or car manufacturing industries, is the same reason I do not believe that Space X will alone run the space industry‚Äôs transportation needs. There is plenty of room for companies like Rocket Lab to fill the gaps Space X cannot and in a decade‚Äôs time, there will be plenty of room for even more companies. Yet, there are no companies that are even close to competing with Space X‚Äîother than Rocket Lab‚Äîat this time. Now, I won‚Äôt go deeply into most of these competitors in this deep dive, but to be short, Astra is on the verge of total failure, Virgin Galactic has been playing an entirely different game‚Äîspace tourism, which there is a massive market for, just perhaps won‚Äôt be penetrated by them‚Äîthey likewise seem to be failing. While Blue Origin has been playing a strong game and Space X an even stronger one, albeit more and more focused solely on Mars as the years go on.

[ Here you can see the 1-year charts of Rocket Lab, Astra, Virgin, and Boeing for reference, as you can see, these charts speak volumes. Rocket Lab has been having a tough year but has found a nice bottom and is consistently bouncing from lows in the $3.6-4 range. While Astra has been reduced to a penny stock, with their future unknown. Virgin Galactic is only maintaining below Rocket Lab‚Äôs share price, partly due to the large number of Retail investors that do not know much and refuse to let it die, coupled with a small hope that the company can recover in the coming years. Boeing is here for reference as to what a successful, large-cap company involved in a similar industry \(and the space industry as well\), should look like over the course of a decent year. ](https://preview.redd.it/4lgxhawavd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d24878b2d7dc72b1e5c87ccd01d67c077485001a)

*Now, there are a few assumptions that I am making that we need to cover before diving into the real DD:* Whether it be because we live in the beginnings of a second Space Race (fueled by privatized space companies and the world‚Äôs governments) or because of technological advancement and a rising interest in space, the increase in rocket launches, space development (in Earth‚Äôs orbit, the Moon, and Mars), and the lowering costs of space launches‚Ä¶ it will become exponentially cheaper, easier, and faster to launch into orbit and the industry as a whole will have a massive boom‚Äîakin, in a way, to the industrial revolution‚Äîover the mid-to-late 2020s into the early 2030s. With the mid-to-end 2030s and early 2040s, we will see massive developments in terms of low-Earth orbit manufacturing facilities, tourist destinations, and stations, as well as settlements on the Moon for mining and refueling for greater exploration and colonization of the Sol System as a whole.

Now these are in part assumptions, but I think once one does the research and looks at the fact, all of this is very achievable. Even if it does not occur in this way, you can shift the dates by an additional decade and every time you do, the more likely, easier, and cheaper it all becomes.

Rocket Lab's business model revolves around providing cost-effective and frequent access to space for small satellite operators. The company aims to simplify the process of deploying satellites by offering dedicated launches on its Electron rocket. Rocket Lab operates as an end-to-end service provider, handling the entire launch process from mission planning and payload integration to launch and on-orbit operations.

# Section 1: Rocket Lab Takes Flight! The Electron & the Neutron

[  ‚ÄòRocket Lab is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, complete spacecraft design and manufacturing, satellite components, flight software, and an on-orbit management.‚Äô ‚Äì Rocket Labs](https://preview.redd.it/nbt3cd8dvd4b1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc518b0149113dc115f082394c2b6e8b33e36707)

Rocket Lab's primary launch vehicle, the Electron, is a two-stage rocket powered by Rutherford engines, which use electric-pump-fed LOX/RP-1 propellants. The Electron is designed to optimize cost, flexibility, and rapid launch capability for small satellites. Rocket Lab has demonstrated numerous successful launches since its inaugural flight in 2017, showcasing its technological prowess and reliability. The small satellite market has been growing rapidly, driven by increased demand for data collection, communications, and Earth observation. Rocket Lab's focus on dedicated launches for small satellites positions it well to capture a significant portion of this expanding market. The company has already established a solid customer base, securing contracts with government agencies, research institutions, and commercial entities.

Rocket Labs‚Äîat the time of writing this‚Äîhas had 37 launches‚Äîwith a 91.89% success rate‚Äîdeployed 164 satellites, operates 3 launch pads, and is maintaining 3 Photon Satellites in the Earth‚Äôs orbit. Of the 164 satellites launched by Rocket Labs, they were commissioned to do so by a wide variety of clients, from NASA, Space Force, DARPA, to Canon. Rocket Labs is supported by Future Fund: Australia‚Äôs Sovereign Wealth Fund, Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Data Collective, Greenspring Associates, ACC, Promus Ventures, L One W One Ltd., and Lockheed Martin.

Rocket Lab‚Äôs main rocket, the Electron‚Äîbuilt and operated by Rocket Lab‚Äîhas flown 37 times and been successful 34 times, with only 3 failures. Rocket Lab‚Äôs key areas of business penetration lie in the launch of mid-sized service rockets, the manufacturing of space systems and satellites, and their adept ability to manufacture industrial space parts, applications, and proponents. The latter of which, they are sort of unopposed in terms of competition.

The Neutron‚ÄîRocket Lab‚Äôs medium-lift, mega constellation launcher‚Äîwill be able to launch 13,000 kilograms into low Earth orbit and it will be ‚Ä¶drum roll please‚Ä¶ reusable! The current goal is for it to launch in 2024. It will be designed for not only low earth orbital supply missions, but also deep space missions, and even human spaceflight. It will be fairing a design allowing for full reusability of the first stage and it will be lightweight, being made of Rock Lab‚Äôs own carbon composite structure. The home base for the Neutron will be at the Neutron Production Complex and the launch pad at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility and Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.

[ ‚ÄòThe Neutron Production Complex will be home to a rocket production, assembly, and integration facility, as well as a dedicated launch pad for the Neutron rocket located on the southern end of Wallops Island. The estimated 250,000 square foot state-of-the-art complex will be constructed on a 28-acre site adjacent to the Wallops Island Flight Facility and will include a Launch Control Center, Rocket Lab‚Äôs fifth global operations center for launch activities and on-orbit operations. To support rapid production of the Neutron rocket, current plans for the complex include automated fiber placement robotic production systems capable of laying up meters of Neutron‚Äôs new, specially formulated carbon composite structures in minutes. As a reusable rocket, Neutron is designed to land back on the Launch Complex 3 pad after a mission and from there it would be returned to the production complex for refurbishment and re-flight.‚Äô ](https://preview.redd.it/k592skwfvd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=279742c6d6196d860258d747af98f84e71b71470)

With Space X dominating large-load space orbital flight and transportation, Rocket Labs, in my honest opinion, is where Space X was roughly something like 6-8 years ago. While Rocket Lab intends to compete with Space X‚Äîwhether it will be considered competition in an industry this brand new and small, time will tell‚Äîfor cargo and humans to the low Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and even Venus! Space X and Elon Musk have made it abundantly clear that the goal of Space X is the large-scale settlement of Mars. While later models of Rocket Lab‚Äôs Neutron will be able to go to Mars and Venus, it appears that is not their main goal. In the near term (being the next two decades), they will be looking to dominate the low Earth orbit and Moon market as well as the manufacturing of industrial space parts, applications, and proponents.

# Section 2: The Space Industry & Company Fundamentals

Rocket Lab faces competition from other commercial launch providers, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. However, the company differentiates itself by specializing in small satellite launches, offering a tailored solution for this niche market. Rocket Lab's Electron rocket provides the advantage of dedicated launches and the flexibility to reach specific orbits, making it an attractive option for small satellite operators.

Rocket Lab has raised significant funding through various investment rounds, securing capital from venture capital firms, strategic partners, and government entities. Notable investors include Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Lockheed Martin. The company's ability to attract substantial investment indicates confidence in its business model and growth potential. Rocket Lab operates within the regulatory framework of the countries in which it launches its rockets. The company holds necessary licenses and approvals from government agencies, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Compliance with safety regulations and adherence to environmental guidelines are crucial aspects of Rocket Lab's operations.

Despite its achievements, Rocket Lab faces several risks and challenges. The space industry is highly competitive, and the success of the company depends on its ability to secure launch contracts and maintain a steady launch cadence. Regulatory changes, launch failures, or delays could impact Rocket Lab's operations and reputation. Additionally, the emergence of new technologies or market disruptors could pose a threat to the company's market position

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room, the Quarterly Results. To preface, negative quarterly results mean‚Äîpardon my French‚Äîjack-shit (at least in the short term) for a company such as Rocket Lab, that is looking at penetrating a market such as the space industry. We are going to look at the past four Quarterly Results in chronological order.

**Q2 2022 Report:** Rocket Lab achieved record revenue of $55.5 million, showing significant growth compared to the previous quarter (36% sequential growth) and the same quarter in the previous year (392% YoY growth). Despite the revenue growth, the company reported a negative EPS of $-0.08, indicating a net loss for the quarter.

**Q3 2022 Report:** Another record revenue was achieved, reaching $63.1 million, with a sequential growth of 14% and an impressive YoY growth of 1,093%. The company's EPS improved slightly to $-0.07 but still remained negative. The fourth quarter revenue is expected to be lower, ranging between $51 million and $54 million, as a launch customer's push extends into 2023.

**Q4 2022 Report:** The company's revenue for Q4 reached $51.8 million, showing a healthy year-over-year growth of 88%. The full-year revenue for fiscal 2022 amounted to $211 million, reflecting substantial growth of 239% compared to the previous year. The EPS remained negative at $-0.08.

**Q1 2023 Report:** The revenue for Q1 2023 was $54.9 million. Increasing revenue by 35% in the first quarter of 2023. Revenue from their launch business was $19.6 million, up $12 million from the prior quarter. Their EPS was $-0.08, indicating strong maintenance of their business. The second quarter is expected to show a significant revenue increase, with an estimated range of $60 million to $63 million.

Now, what does this all tell us? Firstly, they were very forthcoming with the quarterly expectations. Something one might think is not a big deal, but considering how a lot of publicly traded companies operate, this is a good thing. In each of their earnings reports, they have nearly exactly estimated their results, showing they are not attempting to mislead investors. The company has experienced impressive revenue growth throughout the reported quarters, indicating strong market performance and demand for its products/services. However, the negative EPS values suggest that the company is still operating at a net loss. From a shareholder‚Äôs perspective, the company's focus should be on achieving profitability and reducing the negative EPS, while maintaining consistent revenue growth. In my opinion, this stock is sitting just below a fair market value for what it is right now, sitting at just over $4, considering they are not fully profitable. Yet Rocket Lab continues to grow its business, making more contracts, and it stands a competitive chance. If they can turn a profit within 2-3 years, I think they will be one hell of a company. With their competitors failing left and right and none finding the success as Rocket Lab‚Äîother than Space X‚Äîthey could stand to be a massive company in a few decades, so massive, they‚Äôre bigger than Earth.

One last financial point to touch upon‚Ä¶ shorting, so here is some data, which is roughly one month outdated due to my difficulty in finding up-to-date information on the company without a Bloomberg Terminal (So, if anyone on the sub has access to a Bloomberg Terminal and would like to add to my DD in the comments, please do).

**Last Record Date:** May 15, 2023

**Outstanding Shares:** 478,660,000 shares

**Float Size:** 262,310,000 shares

**Short Percent of Float:** 9.80% (The short percent of float represents the percentage of shares available for trading that have been sold short).

**Average Trading Volume:** 4,044,396 shares

**Current Short Volume:** 25,710,000 shares

**Previous Short Volume:** 24,630,000 shares

**Change Vs. Previous Month**: +4.38%

**Dollar Volume Sold Short:** $111.58 million

**Short Interest Ratio / Days to Cover:** 7.7 (This ratio indicates the number of days it would take for the short sellers to cover their positions based on the average daily trading volume.).

The short interest in Rocket Lab has increased from the previous month, with a change of +4.38%. The short percent of the float is 9.80%, indicating that a significant portion of the available shares for trading has been sold short. Now, Rocket Lab‚Äôs short interest is relatively low for a company that has had consistent negative EPS and revenue. Showcasing that the big players in markets either A) believe this company will make a massive turnaround in the near future (1-3 years mark) or B) Rocket Lab, due to its size, is thankfully not on their radar. However, that said, the off-exchange short percentage is 57.69%, showcasing that A) public on-exchange short volume is a complete hoax and Hedge Funds, and other big players are beating down on the stock or B) all of this information is completely misrepresented to retail traders on purpose and the entirety of the United States market system is a complete farce.

# Section 3: Future Prospects & Big Moves

Rocket Lab has demonstrated strong performance and growth potential in the emerging small satellite launch market. The company continues to refine its launch processes, aiming to increase launch frequency and reduce costs further. Additionally, Rocket Lab has plans to develop a larger reusable rocket called Neutron, targeting the medium-lift market segment, which would expand its capabilities and market reach. The company has the potential to be the go-to company for low Earth orbital launches in the short term and in the long term, one of, if not the go-to company, for transportation to the Moon, Mars, and Venus.

[  Peter Beck, founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, did an interview last month on his take on the industry and their future prospects. I wanted to touch briefly on this \(you can find the video on YouTube\).](https://preview.redd.it/ced7t9iivd4b1.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=6579fcd100b405f44d1e65fb13cb185cefe6ed76)

Firstly, the video begins with the commentator stating, ""*With the Space Race this week*,"" the Space X rocket, the most powerful ever built, has scrubbed its launch. While Rocket Lab is adding a new service for testing hypersonic sub-orbital launches, being a welcome addition to the company‚Äôs wide array of services. Beck states that it is a very exciting time, stating that ‚Äú*the United States is kind of lacking behind in hypersonic technologies and this is a great opportunity to have high cadence, test flight environment for these payloads to really move forward the US‚Äôs hypersonic research*.‚Äù He goes on to talk about how these capabilities are essentially repurposed from Rocket Lab‚Äôs Electron Rocket capabilities: ‚Äú*We take a standard Electron orbital-class launch vehicle and we fly it in some really unique trajectories to provide these hypersonic trajectories‚Ä¶ it is taking an Electron and making a couple wee tweaks to it and having a great high frequency hypersonic testing platform that hasn‚Äôt existed*.‚Äù Beck goes on to speak on the launch cadence ‚Äú*being on target for 15 flights*‚Äù this year with the fastest turn around this year being 7 days between flights, saying ‚Äú*the machine is cranking and the vehicles are flying successfully and the last flight was a reusable vehicle and we splashed that down successfully and now we‚Äôre kind at the point where we are recycling and harvesting engines and components off of those launch vehicles and getting ready to put them back into service and re-fly them*.‚Äù He continues, stating, ‚Äú*I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm allowed to say exactly, but‚Ä¶ a whole multiple gambit of reused components that are all now re-entering the production line and going back into service*.‚Äù Morgan Brennan, the interviewer then speaks to how there is this emerging mismatch between supply and demand when it comes to the satellite launch market, with the fact that there are so many satellite constellations that are poised to go into orbit in the coming years and not enough capacity in terms of launching them. So, she then asks about the reusability of Electron and the development of the Neutron. Beck states that, ‚Äú*Electron is really serving that market very well, and there are lots of flight opportunities that are sort of just doing its thing, Neutron is the new flight opportunity for us‚Ä¶ 2026 to 2030 timeframe there is a massive deficit in launch and there are lots of constellations that are all really vying for an ability to get in orbit, so we saw that coming and started work on the vehicle and hopefully we can bring it into service in 2024 and really solve some of those problems and take advantage of that market opportunity*.‚Äù

Now, I don‚Äôt have to tell you all that this is very good to hear from Beck and this is very exciting, showcasing that he really believes Rocket Lab can penetrate this market and become a big player in the ever-evolving industry.

**Rocket Lab Making Big Moves Lately:**

¬∑ Bought Virgin Orbit HQ in California, this was a big win for the company, and folk on the sub were very excited to see this happen. Yay! But, sad and unfortunate for Virgin Galactic, which I am sure many of us space enthusiasts had higher hopes for, oh well, not everyone can achieve their dreams.

¬∑ Rocket Lab reached a new Company record of nine launches within a calendar year.

¬∑ Achieved a record of 100% mission success for Electron launches for the year.

¬∑ Successfully launched CAPSTONE mission to the Moon for NASA, including the first demonstration of Lunar Photon spacecraft platform.

¬∑ Successfully deployed two satellites to space for NASA‚Äôs TROPICS mission on the first of two dedicated launches on Electron for the constellation scheduled in May 2023.

¬∑ Secured another NASA mission to Electron‚Äôs 2023 launch manifest with its Starling mission. Rocket Lab was selected by NASA to launch the Starling mission on an expedited timeline due to long delays and uncertainty with the mission‚Äôs original launch provider.

¬∑ Signed multiple new launch contracts on Electron for 2023 for undisclosed commercial satellite customers previously manifested on another small launch vehicle, demonstrating Electron‚Äôs strong position as a reliable and dependable ride to orbit for small satellite operators.

¬∑ Introduced Rocket Lab‚Äôs new HASTE launch vehicle, a suborbital testbed launch vehicle derived from the Company‚Äôs Electron rocket to provide reliable, high-cadence flight test opportunities to support the development of advanced hypersonic systems technology.

¬∑ Announced that the Company will fly a pre-launched 3D printed Rutherford engine on an upcoming mission in Q3‚Äô23, a major step in evolving the Electron launch vehicle into a reusable rocket.

¬∑ Delivered financial results that exceeded the high end of prior guidance for revenue and gross margin.

¬∑ Launched three successful Electron missions in the first quarter for commercial constellation operators HawkEye 360, Capella Space, and BlackSky.

¬∑ Successfully completed the Company‚Äôs first launch from its U.S. launch site, Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2, at the Virginia Spaceport Authority‚Äôs Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on January 24, 2023. The mission deployed three satellites for radio frequency geospatial analytics provider HawkEye 360.

¬∑ Successfully completed the Company‚Äôs fastest turnaround between launches to date ‚Äì just seven days between its 34th Electron launch, ‚ÄúStronger Together‚Äù, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 in Virginia on March 16, 2023, and its 35th Electron launch, ‚ÄúThe Beat Goes On‚Äù, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand on March 24, 2023.

¬∑ Rocket Lab remains the only U.S. commercial small launch provider to successfully deliver satellites to orbit in 2023. Secured a multi-mission contract with Capella Space to launch four more dedicated launches on Electron in 2023.

¬∑ Achieved programmatic milestones for the Company‚Äôs two Photon spacecraft to support NASA‚Äôs ESCAPADE mission to Mars, and for the Photon spacecraft for a Varda Space Industries‚Äô mission to manufacture high-value products in zero gravity. Both Photon programs include Rocket Lab star trackers, reaction wheels, solar panels, flight software, and radios ‚Äì demonstrating the value and strength of the Company‚Äôs vertical integration and in-house supply chain.

# Conclusion: An Ode to Humanity's Future

Rocket Lab has established itself as a leading player in the small satellite launch market, offering dedicated launch services tailored to the needs of small satellite operators. The company's technological capabilities, solid customer base, and innovative approach position it well for future growth.

Those who lived and grew up in the 1960s and 1970s believed that by the 21st century, mankind would be a space-faring civilization. People had a fascination with the unknown. It was embedded in pop culture, in movies like the 2001 Space Odyssey, Alien, and the Star Trek series. But the unfortunate truth is that after Apollo 17 on the 19th of December 1972, mankind has not left low-earth orbit. The American public lost interest, the government cut funding, and the Saturn V rockets were dismantled and replaced by space shuttles in the 1980s (spaceships not even built to leave low-earth orbit). The curiosity and desire to unravel the mystery of the universe are now again filling the hearts of people. Technology is becoming more advanced and cheaper.

With companies like Rocket Lab and Space X, the future is looking bright. We currently live in an era of mass information. One of the hardest aspects of life in the early-21st-century is learning how to filter all this information. The news of the accomplishments of Rocket Lab, Space X, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA), the European Space Agency (ESA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Space Force, are lost in the large volume of collective data. The average person does not believe how close we are to colonizing Luna and Mars; how close we are to becoming a multi-planetary species. If you walked up to someone on the street of New York City, today, and told them that in the mid-2040s, and by the latest, the 2050s, there will be hundreds if not thousands of people living in Earth's orbit, the upper atmosphere of Venus, the Moon, and Mars, the person would dismiss you in disbelief. But the same would have happened if you walked up to a person on the street of New York City on the 19th of July 1962 (before Kennedy‚Äôs speech) and told them that mankind would step foot on the moon in seven years. Companies like Rocket Lab, which will make orbital flight and transportation affordable, will allow for a new era of civilization, one which was only present and dreamed of in science fiction of the past.

[The Earth, as imaged from the Voyager 1 spacecraft, was suspended in a sunbeam, as the interstellar craft exited the Sol system in 1990. Earth is nearly 4 billion miles away in this image. That is us. That is humanity, all of us that have thus far, ever existed. We take to the stars in search of not only answers but in search of a purpose.](https://preview.redd.it/hnr23odlvd4b1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=298a1ee80b0bc5e3dc0ba5c3c61aa6a25c0682c1)

Why re-usability isn't a priority for Rocket Lab..,"Some people in the investor group I am a part have been asking why Rocket Lab doesn't seem to be prioritising re-usability. The problem with Electron is that it was never originally designed to be re-usable. The company also [over-estimated demand for the small launch industry](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/peter-beck-explains-why-electron-may-only-ever-launch-10-15-times-a-year/) and thus is producing Electron rockets at a faster rate than they are being used. Therefore, re-usability currently serves no purpose other than to boost the company's reputation. I suspect they also do not want another failed catch as this could damage the company's reputation and leed to a loss of confidence amoung investors. Personally, I suspect Rocket Lab will eventually do away with in-air captures and simply retrieve the first stages out of the ocean.",19,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xfgnjx/why_reusability_isnt_a_priority_for_rocket_lab/

A HLS proposal based on the Neutron - Is it even a remote possibility?,"With the news coming out about NASA's search for a 2nd lunar lander for the Artemis program, there is obviously a lot of speculation on the potential bidders. This got me wondering if Rocket Lab could potentially design a Lunar lander based off the Neutron design. To be clear, the Lunar lander will be based on the Neutron. I don't have any ideas about how the launch vehicle for the lander.

I'll admit that my primary reason in thinking on these lines is the resemblance between Neutron and the early Lunar lander concepts in the 1950s and 60s that used direct ascent (For those who have watched it, I am thinking of a lander similar to the one in Tintin).

That aside, here's how I think the design might work, or the modifications that may be required

* The landing legs of the Neutron rocket seem good enough to act as landing legs on the moon as well, and they can also potentially provide some structural integrity to the rocket or serve as structural elements for unfurling solar panels, or pulleys and other lifting mechanisms.
* Within the existing design, the second stage is no longer required and the first stage tanks can be shortened a great deal, with the 7 engines being replaced with fewer vacuum optimized engines.
* The payload bay can be modified to have unfurling solar panels or radiators over a closed cargo/crew area
* With a diameter of about 6 meters and a height of 10 metres or so (assuming a shortened rocket), available for crew/cargo, it should be more spacious than the National team's lander or the Alpaca.
* It uses the same fuel as the Starship, and because of its considerably lesser fuel requirements, a single Starship tanker can potentially fuel multiple trips of the Rocket Lab lander between LEO and the lunar surface.   
Alternatively, a Starship tanker in Low Lunar orbit or NRHO can be used by the Lunar Neutron for refueling, with astronauts transferring into the lander in NRHO. This would enable even more launches with fewer refueling tanker launches.

&#x200B;

A potential issue ( and this is quite a big one if my limited knowledge is correct) I can see, is the endurance of Carbon fibre in outer space.  If I am not wrong, the epoxy used in carbon fibre can degrade over time due to the increased exposure to UV radiation. I understand that there are solutions to work around this problem, but I am not sure how much that would impact the design of the ship. This could obviously be a showstopper for this entire idea if it means that they have to build the ship out of a completely different material.

&#x200B;

Provided that Carbon fibre can be used (or carbon fibre with reasonable modifications), I can foresee a quicker development time for this than Blue's lander or any of the other proposals (except the Lunar Starship). Just like the Starship, Rocket Lab can leverage the similarity between their regular Neutron rocket and the lunar lander and design the lunar lander largely using the same production line, design language and test articles. It will also let Rocket Lab secure development funding from NASA - funding that will be beneficial in the long term as the technical work from the Lunar lander will help a lot with their main rocket as well.

It would be great to see what others think about this idea.",28,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/tnfoh5/a_hls_proposal_based_on_the_neutron_is_it_even_a/

* Triple booster first stage, no staging  
* Double second-stage or single extended  
* Landing legs for RTLS  
* Maybe larger fairing with dual second stage with interstage  


 &nbsp;

**Possible configuration**  

* Triangle configuration of boosters (no staging), with landing legs, nosecone on one of the boosters  
* Inline configuration of two second stages (no staging) mounted on two of the boosters
* 1 m  or 2 m fairing (which would require new molds) plus funky interstage


 &nbsp;

**Discussion:**  

* A triple booster should have enough reserve propellant and thrust to lift the RTLS propellant, legs and account for extra drag.  Either triple-engine landing or dual-engine landing possibilities (depending on landing mass).  
* A dual booster would mean unmodified second stages fastened together, provide thrust needed for up to 600 kg to LEO.  
* A payload interstage would be needed.  
* Could call it Anion (extra electrons)",0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xt9yt3/600_kg_rtls_multicore_electron/

Electron payload,"When I looked up some light rockets from private space companies, I noticed that the payload of electron seems to be at the lower end. Like 300kg to LEO? Other rockets have somewhere between 500-1000kg to LEO. The coming Neutron would be a fair competitor to Falcon 9, but what makes rocket lab different from others if Electron is their only operational rocket for now?

"With Starshield, SpaceX readies for battle","PURSUIT OF DEFENSE DOLLARS
What SpaceX has done with Starlink is to visibly demonstrate how commercial space technology serves national security applications, said Peter Arment, aerospace and defense industry analyst at Baird investment bank.

‚ÄúThis helps SpaceX obviously but also helps the entire industry attract investment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe defense spending space is sort of a rising tide at the moment.‚Äù

Before anyone had ever heard of Starshield, other companies in the space industry started making moves to be better positioned to compete in the national security arena.

Commercial launch provider and satellite manufacturer Rocket Lab on Dec. 1 announced it is establishing a U.S.-based subsidiary for defense and intelligence work, including classified programs.

The new business, called Rocket Lab National Security, will have ‚Äúclose engagement with U.S. government customers to understand their mission requirements, which may be dedicated rapid call-up launch, satellite design, build and integration, spacecraft operations or all of the above,‚Äù Rocket Lab spokesperson Murielle Baker said in a statement.

Tess Hatch, vice president of Bessemer Venture Partners, a Rocket Lab investor, said the mood has shifted from a year ago ‚Äúwhen investors in boardrooms were pounding our fists on the table saying ‚Äògrowth at all cost.‚Äô‚Äù Defense customers can be ‚Äúa little lumpy and unpredictable. However, there are massive potential contracts,‚Äù Hatch said Dec. 6 at the TechCrunch Space conference.

‚ÄúWith markets down and maybe commercial needing to push a little more throttle, the diversity of the customer base is so important,‚Äù Hatch said. ‚ÄúThe government is extra helpful for space companies right now when the commercial side isn‚Äôt as efficient.‚Äù",26,3,https://spacenews.com/with-starshield-spacex-readies-for-battle/

The Rocket Lab Analysis (RKLB),"This post explains why Rocket Lab is at its current price one of the greatest investments you can make and why I‚Äôve personally invested my life savings in it. Note, this is not financial advice, I am an ape and a moron.üçå

**Intro.**

Rocket Lab is a rocket company that is working on building a reusable medium lift rocket. They currently have a small rocket (Electron Rocket) and have had over 20+ successful launches to orbit and have deployed over 100 satellites.

The company just received funding via SPAC to go public to fund development of its new medium lift rocket (Neutron Rocket) which is expected to complete by 2024. There is only one company that has successfully accomplished substantial reusability of such a rocket which is SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 rocket.

**Why is reusability so important for a rocket?**

Most rockets today launch and the entire rocket gets destroyed. Imagine if a Boeing 747 airliner had to be destroyed after every flight, each ticket would be over a million dollars a flight for them to make a profit, this is basically what we do with modern rockets. Make that 747 rapidly reusable again and again, and the cost drops dramatically. NASA attempted to do this with the Space Shuttle program because of the insane costs of the Saturn V (Moon rocket) but failed because of large scale refurbishment needs. Today however, SpaceX has shown proof that it is possible with their Falcon 9 and many companies are working on following.

**Competitor Analysis**

**Astra** ‚Äì Lead by Chris Kemp does show promise, however by 8/2021, 4 of their first launches failed (Rocket 1, Rocket 2, Rocket 3.0, Rocket 3.1) with only their 5th rocket making it to to space but still failing to reach stable orbit in December of 2020 (Rocket 3.2). Astra will undoubtedly be a big player one day; however, they are currently far behind Rocket Lab and eons behind SpaceX, therefore they are no threat. (2021 Estimated 100 employees, mrkt cap \~2.5B)

**Relativity Space** ‚Äì This newer space company has two rocket designs:

Terran 1 is an expendable small sat vehicle which is expected to launch in 2022, no threat.

Terran R is a medium/large class rocket designed to be reusable which poses a direct threat and is expected to make first orbital launch by 2024. 

Relativity Space has yet to achieve orbit, and while their plans are big, they have yet to prove their capabilities. Talk is cheap in this game, it doesn‚Äôt matter how much funding you have, achieving orbit is incredibility difficult. While they are somewhat a threat, I have no doubt that RKLB will beat them to a reusable medium class rocket by many years. (2021 estimated 400 employees, mrkt cap \~4.2B Private)

**Firefly Aerospace** ‚Äì This is another early space vehicle developer which has a few vehicles.

Firefly Alpha ‚Äì Expendable small sat vehicle, has many similarities to the RKLBs Electron rocket, as of 8/2021 it has yet to launch with the first planned launch by 9/2021. As a small sat non reusable vehicle this is of no threat.

Firefly Beta ‚Äì Essentially a scaled up Alpha medium class rocket planned to launch in 2024, it doesn‚Äôt appear to have reusability designed in but they are boasting to have the lowest cost 8000kg LEO delivery vehicle. No threat, the future of space is reusable not expendable, we‚Äôll see how that goes with an expendable design.

Firefly Gamma ‚Äì 2 Stage medium class rocket designed to have the first stage reusable. Highly similar design as a Falcon 9 or the Neutron Rocket and a direct competitor. Planned test flights to start in 2024-2025. 

While the Gamma vehicle is a direct threat, Firefly has yet to achieve orbit with any of their vehicles. Their funding is dismal and they are spreading their R&D over multiple vehicles which will strain their resources greatly. They should probably scrap their Beta project and go straight to Gamma, regardless, on their current course RKLB will beat them by many years even though they are estimating completion at around the same time as neutron. (2021 Estimated 350 employees, mrkt cap \~500M Private)

**Virgin Galactic and Virgin Orbit** \- Excluding Virgins Galactics commercial tourism vehicle, Virgin Orbit has a small sat deployment rocket which launches off an aircraft at high altitude. This was recently announced to go public via SPAC. This is a non-reusable rocket and poses no threat as an expendable small rocket, they will need to switch to a ground launch vehicle if they plan on designing any larger vehicles that would be considered competition. Virgin Galactics space tourism vehicle is another market entirely and also poses no threat.

**SpaceX** ‚Äì SpaceX is the king of the jungle and king of agile development; they have proven the proof of concept and essentially hold the golden standard with their Falcon 9 that RKLB and all the other companies are pushing to match. They currently have the only reusable vehicle in the market and their costs are a fraction of their current expendable vehicle competitors. SpaceX has since stopped upgrades with the Falcon 9 and focused all of their efforts on their new super heavy class vehicle the Starship. The Falcon 9 is a direct competitor however there is enough room in space for two, Elon has shown interest in the Neutron Rocket and Peter Beck and seems to be supportive and sees the value in competition, mainly since he probably sees them as a little brother. Therefore, unless SpaceX decides to become extremely competitive with the Falcon 9 to specifically spite RKLB‚Ä¶ unlikely, they shouldn‚Äôt be a huge threat. The Falcon 9 will no doubt remain #1 for medium/heavy rockets and take the best contracts, but there is enough room for the Neutron Rocket to get some of the market share.

The main concern here is the Starship. A new fully reusable super heavy class vehicle with its maiden flight coming up fast, it could likely start launching satellites as early as next year. Will a fully reusable super heavy class vehicle swoop up all the planetary demand for launch vehicles and hurt Rocket Lab? It might drive down costs, but I think there is plenty of backlog and demand for a superheavy class vehicle to not be as much of a burden. (2021 Estimated 9500 employees, mrkt cap ~75B private)

**Blue Origin** ‚Äì Amazons Jeff Bezos company is also exploring reusable rockets.

The famous phallic New Shepard rocket is essentially a suborbital vehicle which is incapable of deploying satellites or making it to orbit. 

New Glenn ‚Äì This vehicle is a superheavy class fully reusable vehicle in similar competition with SpaceX‚Äôs starship, expected to launch in 2022. There have yet to be any flight tests, so this timeline will likely be pushed to 2023 and beyond.

Blue Origin has been working with much secrecy until now with their new developments so it is difficult to accurately gauge their effectiveness. Regardless, if they are successful the New Glenn could pose to be a major threat. Jeff Bezos has been publishing many hate articles bad mouthing SpaceX and while their tech currently sucks, it is no doubt that if they make a reusable vehicle, they will be a cancerous and below the belt fighting competition. Jeff has enough money himself to bankroll the operation through development no matter how long it takes, and could even theoretically buy out RKLB in its entirety himself, so Blue Origin remains a threat, only time will tell how serious of a threat they will be.

**Others** \- One odd reality with the big prime contractors and government bodies like Lockheed Martin / Boeing (ULA), NASA and others, is that they are not pursuing reusable vehicles, as clear as it is and how profitable it will be, they have made ZERO attempt to pursue this path. Mainly because it is incredibly expensive, takes many years to see a return on investment, and is incredibility difficult to even achieve. They are likely too large, led by corporate goons with no vision. One reality is certain, short of discovering anti-gravity technology, reusable rockets are without a doubt, the future of space travel.

**Rocket Lab Pros**

Rocket Lab currently holds the second most frequentlu annually launched vehicle in the US (Electron Rocket) with over 20 launches as of 8/2021. They have proven their capabilities and ability to achieve orbit and their agile development with minimal funding and personnel.

They have enough money from the SPAC to develop the Neutron Rocket and still hold many shares should they need more in the future.

Proof of concept has been established with SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9; all they need to do is copy that.

They are led by a hands-on engineer who developed rockets, seems to have a great vision, and doesn‚Äôt appear to be a sellout. Very Elon Muskesque. 

Finally, they have enough name recognition to attract enough talent in the industry to pull in new employees to help develop their new vehicle. 

SpaceX had 4 failures and 1 successful small vehicle launch (Falcon 1) before beginning to develop the Falcon 9, with no name recognition, no proof of concept, and no commercialization of space. Rocket Lab has a thousand times more advantage than they did at the time. No other company is in a better position to design a medium class reusable rocket than Rocket Lab is today.

Photon - Rocket Lab also has a customizable universal satellite system called Photon. This satellite can be customized to any customers needs. The main advantage of this is that many customers are searching for a one stop solution, they don't necessarily want to develop satellites especially if they have never done so in the past, it's likely much cheaper for most companies to pay a well proven vehicle that can be customized to their needs, placed in an orbit they need, and collect the data that they need. Photon and systems alike will make it much easier and cheaper for companies to buy and deploy satellites and you could even theoretically argue a rental model for the future for more common orbits and purposes. My personal concern is the barriers for entry for a system like Photon is much easier (still extremely difficult) to develop than a launch vehicle itself, there are already many companies who have specialized and designed their own satellites who could pivot into this market which could make competition difficult, therefore I focused this post on the ground to space transport system.

**Conclusion**

Based on the above, Rocket Lab is essentially the #1 public company to invest in, that will reach market the quickest and has the best odds. That along with the potential Space Boom and Space Bubble that is yet to come shows that RKLB is an absolute great investment right now for a 10‚Äì20-year investment. With enough hype, it could 10-20x within a year or two. Again, this is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor, I am a moron and an ape, and a man who loves aerospace.

Rocket Lab's Neutron should compete for SNC's Dream Chaser - ULA is too expensive.,"EDIT - it did come to my attention I was wrong on the weight of the dream chaser. I thought it was (without much cargo) light enough to be on the Neutron. That isn't apparently true. Still. Manned space flight from Neutron sounds like a great goal. Manned flight is still too dang expensive. 

---OP---

SNC has an amazing space plane (Dream Chaser) that is only $50million per launch - which would make it the cheapest overall launch vehicle to date when the initial research and development costs get burned out of that price.

The only problem is ULA's launch vehicle costs $200 million to launch the space plane into LEO.

The space plane is well within the 8,000kg limit.

Dream Chaser is also already contracted for 6 missions to the ISS.

Knowing how behind Blue Origin and ULA are with the BE-4 engines....this makes the Dream Chaser a prime contractual target for the Neutron.

Any competition besides SpaceX?,"I discovered Rocket Lab recently. I follow a guy called Emmet Peppers. He became a multi millionaire with Tesla stock and has a $3 million investment in SpaceX. He talked about a company called Rocketlab (which I of course had never heard about) and I have been intrigued about it ever since and actually watched every single video of Peter Beck that I could find.

The investment thesis is as follows:
 - Rocketlab, while being a very distant second place to SpaceX, is many years ahead of the completion, and that as such, the valuation could be very attractive long term
 - Peter Beck is extremely skilled and talented and could be a generational founder 

I have been trying to validate the assumption that Rocketlab is years ahead of the competition (besides spacex)

It has been somewhat of a challenge because there are from what I read ‚Äú100s of startups‚Äù. I did notice though that some guys, including some guys with YouTube channels about space, often mentioned Astra, Relativity Space and Firefly.

Last months I spent a few hours trying to watch the CEOs of Astra space, Relativity Space and Firefly.

The only CEO that somewhat stood out was the one of Firefly. I would say that Chris Kemp from Astra was probably the one who raised my eyebrows the most when he emphasized on the absolute need to do daily launches, using mobile launch pads, even insisted that having the capability to launch within 24 hours notice would soon be in demand from space startups, argued that 3D printing and reusability were unnecessary, and used the failing OEM car industry as a model for Astra.

I also reviewed the CEO of Relativity Space who somewhat reminded me about Astra (as far as making huge claims). All the CEO was talking about was ‚Äú3D printing‚Äù. I also visited relativity space‚Äôs website and was perplexed by claims such as making a rocket with ‚Äú100x fewer parts‚Äù. I also was perplexed by the Terran R Rocket which relativity space intends to design as fully reusable (the company has never gone to orbit and intends to use full reusability??)

I did not get a chance to review Virgin Orbit. I am in general skeptical of Virgin Galactic and Chamath Palihapitiya (every single SPACs that he‚Äôs involved with seems to be going nowhere). I also noticed that many in the community were making fun of Blue Origin.

Overall I would say I feel a little reassured as RocketLab being ahead of anything besides SpaceX, but I do notice though that several people, including people that I follow, frequently talk about companies like relativity space or ABL.

Is there any company that is a real threat to rocketlab - Besides SpaceX? What are your thoughts?

Why is RocketLab the only launch provider with a Photon equivalent?,"Photon is a really cool addition to RocketLab's Electron rocket.

It blurs the lines between being a part of the payload and part of the launch vehicle, in a way it's both at once. From the customer's perspective it must be really useful to have Photon as an option when launching your payload. It can provide extra thrust to reach higher orbits than Electron alone, or it can provide the orbit circularisation burn at apogee, in both cases removing the need for the payload to handle those burns and keeping the final payload mass low. But it's also a communications bus to talk to Earth, has precision guidance systems and star tracking to assist in those final burns, further reducing payload complexity.

I was looking up Photon to make this post and I discovered they've made it even better than I already thought it was. The CAPSTONE mission to the moon last year used an upgraded Photon with an upgraded engine. They're marketing it as a full satellite bus with solar panels and radio antennae for missions to Mars or Venus. I thought it was just the kick-stage for the last little nudge to the correct orbit, I didn't realise it was so capable.

Which feeds more into my question, why doesn't anyone else have a Photon equivalent?

RocketLab's website describes Photon as being ""Vertically integrated with in-house subsystems based on constellation-scale manufacturing capabilities"". Yeah, it's made by people who routinely make and launch rockets, uses known parts and subsystems with known behaviours and capabilities. It just makes sense that the rocket manufacturer can make a really effective satellite bus, especially for customers where this might be their first satellite. I wonder if the customer base of smallsat providers / first launches is why this is relevant for RocketLab but not SpaceX. In theory SpaceX make a bigger and better kickstage/satellite-bus with Draco/Superdraco engines and help people launch more capable satellites. But Falcon 9 is so much bigger that their customers are usually larger and more capable of managing their own payloads. Electron is so much smaller and more of their customers are smallsats / first ever launches and they need to lean more heavily on the launch provider.

It may also be that Falcon 9's second stage has excess capacity compared to Electron's second stage. Apart from Starlink launches very few Falcon 9 launches come within 20% of the max payload capacity so they just use the second stage for circularisation burns or finessing the orbital insertion. Electron can't do that because it's so close to the mass limits and it's more efficient to ditch the second stage mass and use a smaller kickstage for circularisation burns.

But I'm just guessing blind really. I'd like to see SpaceX develop a Photon equivalent for Falcon 9. Or someone else, maybe Stoke or Relativity Space or ISRO.",35,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/176zsgg/why_is_rocketlab_the_only_launch_provider_with_a/

I want an Electron Launch using 3D / Spacial cameras,If you are reading this Rocket Lab tech employees and want to get a bunch of people excited to watch a launch (I watch them anyway since they are fun) put some live feed 3D / Spatial cameras on the pad or set up one to record a launch and then allow viewing of it.  Be the first!  There are probably around 150K Vision Pros out now and there is lack of immersive content.  People love space and the few best apps available for the Vision Pro are centered around space since it‚Äôs beautiful to look at in 3D.

Is Rocket Lab's Rosy Outlook a Problem?,"It bothers me that Rocket Lab marketed the #ItsATest launch as a success.  The tone in [this press release](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/latest/rocket-lab-successfully-makes-it-to-space-2/) is very positive and really attempts to downplay the fact that the rocket didn't reach orbit.  There are tons of cheering engineers in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA_8HPsua0c), and no shots of disappointed engineers, or really any indication that the rocket didn't reach orbit.

I understand that they *want* to be optimistic, and *want* to have a success, but this launch was strictly speaking, a failure.  It didn't reach orbit.  Failure is a strong motivator, and I'm concerned by them taking such a rosy outlook on the launch.  They did get a lot of subsystems to work, but in space, you need to get every single thing right, and nothing else matters.  It seems to me like if they fail with a customer sat attached, they might spin it as ""Rocket Lab Brings Commercial Satellite Into Space"", instead of owning up to their failure.

Maybe this will change, and I imagine that this is part of this being the first flight.  It did accomplish many milestones, and I hope that only a complete success is accepted from further flights.  It's just concerning to see Rocket Lab trying to massage the truth so much to get a positive spin on what happened.

Is anyone else bothered by this?",41,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/6ddv70/is_rocket_labs_rosy_outlook_a_problem/
Estimating Neutron first launch date based on publicly announced milestones,"Reposting with some updates to assumptions, from a different account for privacy reasons. Calculations haven't changed, and reference data is shown in the table at the bottom.

A little out of interest and mostly out of boredom, I decided to collate some public statements around Neutron development milestones to estimate the delay to Neutron's first launch date. For this, I collected statements from:

* Presentations available on Rocket Lab's investor relations page
* Archived versions of the Neutron page on the Rocket Lab website

This work could be expanded significantly by trawling through videos, interviews, etc as well (but not by me, this was already only mildly less boring than what I was avoiding doing). It is only a very simple analysis, with some large assumptions being made. Of course, these are only adjustments to public timelines and contain no inside knowledge of Rocket Lab's schedules or internal estimates.

Here's a chart of the results up front:

[Chart of Neutron first launch date estimates. The x-axis is the date that the statement of a milestone was made \(either Archimedes first hot fire or LC-3 readiness\).](https://preview.redd.it/gx0p4rpf4mmc1.png?width=3126&format=png&auto=webp&s=f13b2973239623152232b2c6b00da92ff294b353)

There are two different estimates based on two different approaches for each public statement date:

1. Simple Delay - assumes the amount of work after the milestone date remains the same as the original schedule, and adds the delay to the original launch date of 31 Dec 2024. This means that if Archimedes first hot fire is delayed by one year, the first launch date is delayed by one year.
2. Proportional Delay - this assumes that the effort estimates for the whole schedule are off by some factor, and applies that factor to the remaining activities as well. I.e., if it takes twice as long to reach Archimedes first hot fire from project start, it will also take twice as long to reach first launch from project start.

There are obviously a fair few assumptions going into this very basic analysis:

* Archimedes and LC-3 readiness are on the critical path to first launch. This means any delay to either of these is a delay to first launch. None of the calculated dates above assume a delay in both, only one or the other (and all but one is based on a delay in Archimedes).
* It does not account for any ""accelerations"" such as the company throwing significantly more people or money at the program, purchasing more components rather than building in house, etc. It also assumes that any planned ramp up in personnel is included in the original timeline and any other timelines shared publicly by the company.
* It assumes publicly announced dates were the best dates known to the company at the time, and takes them at face value on this.
* These two models for estimating delay are valid.
* When milestones were only listed as being completed in ""Q3"", the latest date in that quarter or month was assumed.
* When milestones were listed on the timeline on the Neutron page (only sorted by year, but in order), best guess was applied for delivery date to try and be most reasonable.
* It includes all delays - including from changing Archimedes architecture and having to redo a bunch of work there.

**What does this tell us?**

Neutron is probably delayed based on the assumptions made here, without a significant change in approach or spend - this analysis estimates to 2026 in all likelihood. This isn't a validated approach to estimating first launch of a new rocket, so you could dismiss it entirely if you want.

I personally think the first launch will be somewhere in between the Simple Delay and Proportional Delay (a bit closer to the Simple Delay) as the company will be trying to accelerate as much as they can to recover the timeline, and the Proportional Delay estimates are therefore extremely conservative. But at this scale, it only takes a few simple mistakes to significantly delay a program, so who knows.

**If you wanted to take this further**

I would recommend two next steps:

1. Add in more information sources (interviews, podcasts, videos, info from Electron launch livestreams, etc)
2. Perform the same analysis for other companies' first rockets that have actually launched to roughly assess the validity or accuracy of the method

Tl;dr - just look at the pretty graph

Is Relativity Space overpromising?,"I acknowledge that this is a bit of a rhetorical question, because RS hasn't launched yet, but that's kind of the point. They haven't launched Terran 1 yet, but they've announced plans with insane deadlines to send a second generation launch vehicle that's going to be as big as Starship to Mars (and beat SpaceX there, no less). Somehow, even though they haven't launched anything, they have enormous amounts of funding and a [pad at Cape Canaveral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_Space#Cape_Canaveral_LC-16). They will be having the [first launch](https://www.spacelaunchschedule.com/launch/terran-1-maiden-flight/) of Terran 1 later this month.

Full admission, I'm biased against RS because I'm invested in RKLB, and RS is a private company which us retail investors aren't able to invest in. If RS is as good as they claim to be, then they would obviously be a threat to RKLB, which until now, has been second best next to SpaceX, and the best space launch investment option on the public markets by far.

At the same time, I see the wild claims that RS makes, and it makes my bullshit detector want to go off. Sure, RS has cool 3D printing tech, but does that really qualify them as rocket designers? Rocket engineering is notoriously hard. Announcing ambitious plans and timelines for a second generation vehicle when you haven't even launched one of your first generation vehicles reeks both of arrogance and of inexperience. It seems pretty obvious that they will want to make many changes to the design of their vehicles and iterate.

Technology wise, I get that they have a cool metal 3D printer, but it makes me cringe every time I hear them say that their technology is powered by ""AI"". To me, that says that the company is relying on buzzwords to lure naive investors that have no understanding of the technology involved. We also know that their rocket is not, in fact, fully 3D printed. I personally doubt that their construction method is particularly cost-effective, but that remains to be seen.

This last point is debatable, but I also feel like the relatively large size of the Terran 1 rocket is an error. It's a fairly large two-stage vehicle. If you've ever used a 3D printer, you know that the time needed to print something increases rapidly with the size of the object. Having a large rocket means that your prints take much longer, which in turn means that you iterate quite a bit slower. RS could have chosen to start by printing a smaller suborbital rocket so they can really test their technology, iterate rapidly on design changes, and then go for an orbital vehicle when they have more experience. Instead they're directly going for a large two-stage rocket and trying to launch it to orbit. If they need to iterate on this, it will take longer and be more costly.

RS is having their first launch later this month. Maybe they'll succeed and we'll all be really impressed that they've nailed it on their first try. Or maybe Terran 1 will blow up, there will be months of delays after that, and we'll eventually find out that RS has more in common with Nikola than SpaceX.",40,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wiex5n/is_relativity_space_overpromising/

One of the similarities is the design of the probe capsule, which is almost identical in shape.

Rocket Lab Satellite Launch Puts SpaceX Challenger Back on Track,,73,0,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-20/rocket-lab-satellite-launch-puts-spacex-challenger-back-on-track
"I wonder if Rocket Lab has considered making competitor solid-fuel-kickstages vs Thiokol's 37Y/47B kickstages. These are all about mass-fraction, and Thiokol's are made of metal, so maybe Rocket Lab could out mass-fraction them (and/or match them, but for cheaper) via their carbon fiber skills?","So, for a long while now, Thiokol's ""Star motor"" lineup of high-mass-fraction solid-fuel kickstages has been the standard, go-to kickstage to use, i.e. when trying to give a bunch of extra delta-V to a lightweight probe that you are trying to get to a high velocity for a far away destination (i.e. stuff like the Voyager probes, New Horizons probe, Pioneer probes, Parker Solar Probe, etc).

But, I think they also use them for earth-orbiting satellites sometimes, too, to get a bit more (relatively) cheap delta-v during the final phase of the launch to get them into higher orbits that would otherwise require a bigger launch vehicle, but that you can tip over the edge into doability by just adding a Thiokol Star27 or Star37 or Star48 kickstage to payload in the top of a smaller launch vehicle, and thus save a bunch of money overall, from not having to pay for a bigger launcher than would've otherwise been necessary.

For those who are unfamiliar with these kickstages, here is the Thiokol Star motor wiki page that goes into detail and specs about a bunch of these solid-fuel kickstages:

[Thiokol ""Star"" solid fuel kickstage motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_(rocket_stage)/).

Edit: not sure how to get the wiki link to work, since the url ends in a parentheses, lol.  I tried adding a slash after the parentheses in the link coding, to see if that might help, but that didn't work either.  Anyway, if you click on the ""did you mean Star (Rocket Stage)"" link at the top of that page it links to, that takes you directly to the proper page.

Here are some photos (from wikipedia) of what these Thiokol Star-kickstage motors look like, for those who are curious:

[Star 27 motor](https://imgur.com/a/oSQHlIr)

[Star 37 motor](https://imgur.com/a/sd54wSv)

[Star 48 motor](https://imgur.com/a/pr5x4q9)

[Star 48 motor aftermath](https://imgur.com/a/XBnhYyd) This last one is of a Star 48 kickstage motor that failed to burn up in the atmosphere when it fell back to earth, and thus randomly landed on the ground somewhere in the middle of the Saudi Arabian desert.  (Note the facial expression of the dude on the right, btw).

As you can see, the ISP of the best of these (the Star-37Y and Star-48B) are only in the 290s (albeit not bad for solid fuel, but, still, obviously not as high as something like, say, a hydrogen upperstage), but, the idea is that if you get a good enough mass-fraction, you can potentially outperform a stage with a much higher ISP, if your mass-fraction is better than the mass-fraction of the higher ISP stage, by a wide enough margin, if the payload has a relatively low mass but needs a lot of delta-V.  (Mass fraction is the ratio of the fueled weight vs dry weight of the stage).

As you can see, the mass fractions of a lot of their motors are in the 92-93% range, which is pretty high for such a tiny, final stage (the smaller the stage, the harder and harder it becomes to get a decent mass fraction, especially for liquid-fueled stages, as the plumbing and injector gear and wiring and combustion chamber and cooling channels, along with the body and nozzle and so on, all becomes a higher and higher percentage of the overall mass of the stage relative to the mass of the propellant of the stage, which is why these little solid-fuel kickstages start becoming interesting, because they are so bare and simple and minimalist that you can get a fairly high mass fraction even for a very small stage like this).

Cost-wise, as usual, it is pretty hard to find any info on what these things cost, but, from searching around a bit on google, looks like maybe they cost somewhere around 4 million bucks a pop.

Anyway, so, seems like Thiokol makes these things out of metal (titanium, I think?).

So, with how good Rocket Lab has become at making stuff out of carbon fiber in recent years, and how they are able to use machines to do the fiber-laying very quickly and efficiently and (once it is set up properly) cheaply (relatively speaking), and how the solid-fuel kickstage game is basically all about getting your mass fraction to be as good as possible, it makes me wonder if Rocket Lab would potentially have an edge, at something like this.

Presumably they could get the mass fraction of a carbon fiber version of those things to be even better than titanium (I'm not actually sure about this, but, it doesn't seem outside the realm of possibility that it could be the case, and perhaps even by a decent margin) and/or maybe merely match the mass fraction, but be able to do it more cheaply or something.  Or maybe a mixture of both.

Also: keep in mind, the hot fire going on inside the motor doesn't really heat the exterior body (made of metal, or in Rocket Lab's case, would be carbon fiber if they did what I'm describing) for the first 99% of the burn, because the solid fuel, itself, that is inside the casing, basically shields the casing from the fire going on inside, as the fuel burns from the innermost inside on outwards as it burns.  So, for those thinking that a carbon fiber body would be a no-go, because it couldn't handle the heat of the combustion, I don't think that would be an issue.  Perhaps there would be other issues, though, of some other reasons why it wouldn't be good (maybe it wouldn't handle the vibrations as well, or the angle(s) of the forces or something?  Not sure.

Anyway, yea, so, just something I was pondering about I guess.  Curious what you think.

Would Rocket Lab be able to be a good competitor in the solid fuel kickstage market, versus Thiokol, by offering a similar, but carbon fiber-style lineup of these types of motors?",36,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/rygmbt/i_wonder_if_rocket_lab_has_considered_making/

Speculation on the long-term evolution of commercial launch in this decade (with an eye towards heavy lift as well as Relativity Space),"Hey all,

Just thought I'd put this out there as purely hypothetical (borderline tinfoil) speculation on what could happen in the years to come as the commercial launch market continues to evolve.

First off, a fun thought exercise - what would you name a potential heavy-lift launch vehicle that Rocket Lab could develop after Neutron?

Peter Beck has mentioned recently that they have no plans on retreading the rocket development path, but if SpaceX manages to get the Starship system operational this decade and it disrupts the industry like everyone thinks it will, Rocket Lab may be forced to adapt once again.

In that case, after looking at a variety of options, I personally like Hadron^1 the most. It already has name recognition thanks to CERN's Large Hadron Collider. Additionally, the neutron itself is a member of the hadron class of subatomic particles.

So, not only would Hadron be a logical progression from a particle physics perspective, it would also have instant name recognition. Just imagine: ""Rocket Lab's Hadron Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle"" - rolls off the tongue rather nicely eh?

Second, I got to thinking about consolidation in the commercial launch sector moving forward, as an economic downturn looms and we exit the near-zero interest rate environment that led to the previous decade's boom in launch startups. Many executives in the industry ([including Beck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qcHd13G6yQ)) have made public statements about this in the past couple of years.

Other small launch newcomers already have strong ties to large defense primes that may suggest acquisition down the line (e.g. Lockheed Martin with ABL and Northrop Grumman with Firefly)

The only two remaining non-""billionaire funded"" U.S. commercial LV players with significant financial runways are Rocket Lab and Relativity Space.

I've read previous threads on this sub discussing Relativity and the sentiment seems to be that despite the fact that they've yet to launch, they are a competitor worth paying attention to due to significant private investor interest, high quality talent (mostly ex-SpaceX), and potentially game-changing proprietary tech.

Once again, if Starship proves to work as advertised, and/or macroeconomic conditions continue to deteriorate, market participants may be forced to consolidate in order to survive. Precedent is currently being set in the satellite operator space as multi-billion dollar players have begun M&A processes under growing pressure from Starlink (e.g. Oneweb / Eutelsat and Viasat / Inmarsat). While less common, we've also previously seen consolidation in the launch industry, with Lockheed + Boeing's ULA JV, Airbus + Safran's ArianeGroup JV, and Orbital + ATK's merger. Aerojet Rocketdyne's recent tie-ups with Northrop and L3Harris also come to mind. Granted, each of these cases is unique, but anything is possible in this space, regardless of how large or established a company is.

Thus, I see no inherent reason why a Rocket Lab + Relativity merger couldn't be possible down the line, assuming both companies continue to grow and execute at pace. (A major assumption, to be sure!)

I realize this is probably the last thing on either company's mind at the moment but hear me out. Below is a big picture list of observations on both companies, with an emphasis on their similarities and potential synergies:

- Co-location at NASA Stennis for both companies' next-generation reusable methalox engine testing: Both Aeon R and Archimedes test complexes will be located fairly close to each other at Stennis. I wouldn't be surprised to see some degree of cross-pollination between the construction, engineering, and technician staff across both programs
- Both companies are vocal champions of additive manufacturing techniques throughout major components of LV production
- Both companies' headquarters are located just 3 miles away from each other in Long Beach
- Rocket Lab has proven to be a pragmatic, execution-rich organization. Relativity has proven to be a forward-looking, ambition-rich organization. Combining these modalities could in theory lead to an organization greater than the sum of its parts - SpaceX, the current market leader, has both of these elements in spades
- With Neutron, Rocket Lab is optimizing for operational efficiency with partial reusability and RTLS as their north star, whereas with Terran-R, Relativity is leaning on highly novel structures with full reusability as their north star. If Relativity manages to crack the full reusability problem at sub-Starship scale,^2 both companies' tech could combine in a unique way for a joint RL/RS designed heavy lift vehicle (possibly the Hadron as spitballed above)
- Both companies have good design, PR, and marketing (see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2GT204CEVk), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aJ5NPt5fSM), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kwAPr5G6WA), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BhkjEc6Q64), and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Vf3MlbtAs)), which helps excite the general public and attract talent

Curious what everyone here thinks of both the HLV name brainstorm and a potential team-up with Relativity. Obviously there is an extremely low chance of either happening in this decade, but it's fun to think about as these companies race to develop vehicles that will ultimately launch next-gen constellations, commercial space stations, interplanetary missions, and much more.

Footnotes

1. Some alternatives: Graviton, Baryon, Fermion
2. Stoke Space's [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzqhZLgpiv0) also claims to have cracked the full-reusability problem but they are much earlier-stage and have less funding at this point in time. Definitely worth keeping an eye on though.

Any chance for consideration?  Rejected due to short jobs(Aviation background).,"I had applied for Vehicle Integration and got scheduled for a phone interview.  When the date/time came, I didn't receive a call but about an hour later got a message that RocketLab decided to go with NZ/Aus residents for the position.  Yesterday, I get a email about another job I had applied for(Reaction Wheel) that got filled and was telling me to basically reapply.  I see that Vehicle Integration is still up there so I inquired on whether I should reapply for that too.  The response I got was most of my recent jobs were too short and the team decided to move on.

I never got a chance to interview to explain that those were contract jobs in the aviation field.  They said they were looking for people that had +3yrs at one place but the last 7 years I just worked in aviation(though worked at Sierra Space and Huntington-Ingalls in that time span too), I think most I spent at one place was 2 years but we ended up getting laid off a lot when the job was done.  Prior to getting into aviation, I worked at Caterpillar for 5 years.

[Discussion] Will Neutron be able to compete in the 2024 market?,"As probably most people here are, I am excited about the Neutron announcement. But I'm also wondering if Neutron will be able to compete by the time it comes to market in 2024. Let's talk about how the market will look like in the future, please let me know if you disagree with any assumptions I made in this post.

Let's be optimistic and assume Neutron will work out exactly the way they plan to do it. It will be a partially reusable orbital launch vehicle, putting 8 tons into LEO, reusable. It will essentially be able to do exactly what Falcon 9 is able to do now, just with roughly half the payload, and I assume, roughly half the cost.

Currently, in 2021, Neutrons competition would be primarily Falcon 9, as that's the only operational partially reusable orbital launch vehicle.

A Falcon 9 launch is currently sold for around 60 million dollars. There's likely quite a bit of margin in there, as SpaceX does not have any real competitors for Falcon 9 launches currently, so I assume Rocketlab might be able to sell a Neutron launch for around 20 millions dollars. Which would be a great price. So if Neutron would launch now, in 2021, it would be very competitive and force SpaceX to lower their prices quite a bit. That's nice!

But now it's 2021, and Neutron won't launch before 2024. Based on what we know about the development of other rockets, I'd say it's highly unlikely that Neutron will actually launch in 2024, it's likely a ""Q4 2024"" date estimate, so it will become at least 2025, around 4 years from now, and even that would still be optimistic.

The main competitor for Neutron in 2025 will not be Falcon 9 any more, SpaceX likely plans to not even fly any Falcon 9 any more by 2025. The main competitor will be Starship from SpaceX, a fully reusable launch vehicle. SpaceX aims to have a Starship launch cost around 2 million dollars (https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-flight-passenger-cost-elon-musk.html). That's operational costs, so it won't be the price SpaceX sells it for, let's assume that will be 5 million dollars. 4 years is a lot of time for SpaceX to optimize their Starship architecture for lowest possible launch price, after all, Starship was supposed to reach orbit in 2020 already, and it's highly likely they will reach orbit with it in 2021. It won't immediately be as cheap as they hope, but if they can't get the cost down to what they plan by 2025, something would have to go majorly wrong with SpaceX plans I'd say. So betting against them being successful sounds like a dangerous bet.

So in 2025, there will likely be the options of 

- Launching 8 tons into LEO on a partially reusable Neutron for around 20 million dollars

or 

- Launching 100 tons into LEO on a fully reusable Starship for around 5 million dollars.

Starship will also be able to have a significantly higher launch cadence, as SpaceX won't have to build a new second stage for every launch, which Rocketlab will need to do. 

Would there be enough customers who will pick Neutron over Starship?

One reason to pick Neutron which I can think of would be because you're working on some kind of satellite constellation which you have to launch, and you don't want to finance your main competitors (Starlink from SpaceX, Kuiper from Amazon) with your own launches. Building satellite constellations costs a lot of money though, and not many companies will try to do that. Creating a new satellite constellation in 2025 might be too late to even get into that market, as both Starlink from SpaceX and Kuiper from Amazon will be very operational by then, and Amazon will also always prefer to launch on New Glenn, which will also be operational by 2025. But if there's a major satellite constellation being built after 2025, and the company who builds it does not want to finance their main competitors (SpaceX and Amazon) with their launches, they'll likely pick Neutron for their launches. So that's good for Rocketlab.

But apart from that, is there anything else where Neutron will be very competitive, and not in danger of being overshadowed by the fully reusable launch architecture that Starship offers? Once someone has a fully reusable orbital launch vehicle, it will be very hard for anyone with an only partially reusable launch vehicle to compete. 

Please let me know your thoughts!",14,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/lwpwhk/discussion_will_neutron_be_able_to_compete_in_the/
I dont understand why Neutron are going to be human-rated,"Beck said under the announcement that it is very exciting that Neutron will be capable of human spaceflight. However, I dont see why this will benefit Rocket Lab. I have three reasons why  


1. ISS will planned to de-orbit within 10 years.  In a optimistic time frame will Neutron not be able to carry any humans within 5 years and after all will SpaceX  be very hard to compete with once this is done. 
2. Intercontinental Human Transportation. It is probably a market of billionaires which wants to fly. However, Rocket Labs vision is to make  space commercially viable and more accessible. But is this the way to go? As far as I understand given the size of the vehicle, the maximum amount of passengers in a flight will be approx the same or less as dragon which means it will be fairly expensive for each seat. In my opinion is that not so commercial and accessible. 
3. Very expensive, risky and time consuming to make a human-rated spacecraft. It takes years with testing and if anything explodes during a human flight the company will be bankrupt  (or close to) immediately.     


Neutron will probably be a great medium-lift launch vehicle for satellites, but I am not sure spending time making it human-rated will benefit the team. What do you guys think?",26,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/mhq5pr/i_dont_understand_why_neutron_are_going_to_be/

"My gut feeling: Solaero acquisition was a mistake, and perhaps a very bad one","I expressed a lot of concerns back in December about that acquisition:
 - 5 % gross margins: there is not really any cost savings with this acquisition. Why not just buy the solar panels directly from a third party, just like I assume spaceX does??? SpaceX doesn‚Äôt seem to have any issues sourcing solar panels!
 - Massive 60 % expansion of headcount at rocketlab
 - Rocketlab has 0 experience in solar panels construction
 - Massive distraction on top of the many challenges the company already faces 

To the list above we can now 
 - add a massive market meltdown
 - runaway inflation, which likely is going to be a big deal when selling something manufacturing intensive with 5 % gross margin

Was this acquisition motivated by the revenue increase from the low margin solar panels? I sincerely hope not. Because here‚Äôs the deal: most investors don‚Äôt give any multiple multiple to this.

I listened to the earning call today‚Ä¶ and I can‚Äôt help but feel that my concerns were warranted. Very negative contribution to gross margins.

Idea to make the photon spacecraft more enticing,"**Hello fellow RocketLab fans,**

i am not the brightes star in the system, so i humble ask you for critique and feedback for my ideas.

&#x200B;

**Basics:**

As far as i understand it, the two most prevailing problems with satellites are the following:

1. Running out of propellant for orientation and/or maneuvering in space: When a satellite runs out of propellant for their main engine or for its maneuvering thrusters it becomes a danger for other spacecraft and needs to deorbit or it just cannot be used for its original purpose anymore.
2. The reaction wheels stop working: Reaction wheels are one of two means to orientate the spacecraft in space. If they stop working, the only left means of orientation are the maneuvering thrusters, which depletes the propellant even faster. Surprisingly this is a common problem for a lot of spacecraft which fly longterm in vacuum.

To put it in a nutshell, most satellites are not limited by the longevity of their sensors or mission specific hardware, but bc of both outlined problems. This is a big problem for the owners of satellites, bc they need to replace them despite of their core functions still working. This is a huge concern and cost factor for anyone operating longterm space hardware in orbit.

&#x200B;

**Upgrade for the longevity of the photon hardware:**

RocketLab wants to promote the photon hardware as a base satellite, on which customers can add whatever their needs desire. This is a huge sellingpoint, bc most customers don't want to build and operate the base functions, but only their mission specific sensors. But this solution does not solve the former outlined problems of longterm spacecraft in orbit. So my solutions are the following:

1. RocketLab should add a fueling port for whatever the maneuvering system is using to operate. This allowes the photon base to be fueled in orbit, if the need arises.
2. RocketLab should use modular reaction wheels which can be removed and added easily while in orbit.
3. Rocketlab should operate a refuelable maintenance tug in orbit which is capable of refueling the upgraded photon satellites and remove/add said reaction wheel modules.

With this setup, Rocketlab has an offer for its customers to keep their hardware in working order and extend the longevity of their satellites. In addition the vertical integration of Rocketlab allows them to generate additional revenue maintaining satellites and constellation with limited cost. This would make the the photon way more competitive for singular solutions and constellations.",15,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/ppbllq/idea_to_make_the_photon_spacecraft_more_enticing/

Has anyone else been getting emails from ""Rocket Lab"" saying they have positions open and would like to conduct an interview with me. It seems fine at first but the more I look at the paperwork and such I am pretty sure it is a scam that someone is doing. So if someone see's it be careful I doubt that it is the real company. I can attach a screengrab of the email I have got a few times now. Then once you answer the email like an automated one sends again saying to contact them through teams and to continue with the interview through there. I am pretty positive this is a scam but I haven't talked with them other than sending the first email.

Rocket Lab will design its own crewed spacecraft?,"It seems that yes

&#x200B;

I will now explain why I believe Rocket Lab will design its own manned spacecraft, and will not use Soyuz spacecraft.

&#x200B;

\-Rocket Lab has recently announced that they plan to deliver cargo around the world, (sort of like E2E).

So obviously they will design a re-entry vehicle...then they could adapt it for the manned missions they have announced.

\-If Rocket Lab were to buy a Soyuz capsule, they would be using Russian technology... and there are problems with Russia.

They would also be wasting money if in the future they want to build their own capsule....

And there are many other factors...

\-The Starliner can't be launched on Neutron in the reusable version, and besides, the starliner doesn't even work lol....

\-In the future there will be several space stations, and RL will not be left behind.

Also, for now Europe doesn't have its own spacecraft, the Susie spacecraft is under development, and according to what ArianeGroup has announced, operational flights will arrive in 2030.

So RL could develop a capsule or support body to sell seats to Europe.

\-The small spacecraft could also serve as a reusable second stage and RL would have a fully reusable multipurpose vehicle.",43,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xivd25/rocket_lab_will_design_its_own_crewed_spacecraft/

Quantifying Rocket Lab's potential,"If anyone is interested in determining how much market there is in ***maintaining*** new-space infrastructure, then think in terms of satellite lifespan.

Black Sky's satellites have a 3 year lifespan. Which is great for repeat business. (Star Link's satellites have a 5 year lifespan).

I look forward to someday quantifying an average lifespan per small sat and thus determine how many launches are needed just to maintain the infrastructure.

What kind of constellation Rocketlab will be producing in the future? ,"Dear Community, We have all done our in-depth DD for months and years. One thing is still unclear to me: what's your speculation on the main constellation product Rocketlab will produce in the future? We understood that 1/3 of the business is in launch, but mostly is and will be in space systems. SpaceX has that valuation mostly for Starlink, and we are all aware of ASTS products. It seems that big money is being made right now in connectivity and telephone services. Do you see Rocketlab going that way? And if yes, do they have the right expertise to deliver? I would have loved for Rocketlab to develop ASTS tech; that would have been epic!  I have no doubt about Beck's team execution (facts speak for themselves), Neutron will kick ass 100% but what's next in terms of space system product is very obscure to me. Let's have a conversation on that for the sake of investing and intellectual exercise. Thanks!",22,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1dz6mue/what_kind_of_constellation_rocketlab_will_be/

If SpaceX is successful with Starship is that a positive for Rocket Lab?,"https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/

May seem like a odd question but I think it‚Äôs important to ask.  Now Rocket Lab‚Äôs Neutron rocket is not quite competing with Starship but rather the Falcon 9.  However if Starship is successful would that mean potential customers would go with Starship (or Falcon 9) versus Rocket Lab and Neutron? Is there enough demand for both company‚Äôs rockets ?  Is there enough differences to make them both needed?

However Rocket Lab does launches that seem to focus on a different market segment then Starship and Rocket Lab also manufactures satellite components that could and likely go into many of the satellites that Starship is launching.",60,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/rf79gh/if_spacex_is_successful_with_starship_is_that_a/

Chances in Satellite Broadband?,"Recently I just read a report concerning the Satellite Broadband as a alternative to undersea cables in the future and it mentions the companies like OneWeb, SpaceX's Starlink, Telesat's Lightspeed and Amazon's Kuiper.

As a RKLB investor with no space tech background (All I learnt are from the internet), I feel these companies can be huge customers to RKLB. I did some research on Lightspeed and Kuiper. They are both linked to the blue-origin. And Kuiper was contracted to the ULA for 9 launches but noted it will continue to explore all option for launching the remaining satellite.

I know that Blue Origin is owned by Jeff Bezos but Kuiper also contracted with ULA so I assume RKLB still has a chance to win those contracts. I will be very grateful if anyone here can share some info about the competitiveness of RKLB to ULA and Blue Origin and how they differ to each others. 

Thank you so much to all and I want to be a more knowledgeable investor.",9,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/se3jrs/chances_in_satellite_broadband/

Any good biographies about Peter Beck?,"So I was trying to read up on Peter Beck's life, and the journey he underwent to create Rocket Lab. 

Using Wikipedia as a starting point, I was pretty shocked to see just how bad and sparse that Wikipedia article is. 

Further, I can find little else in terms of an indepth analysis of his life. 

I was able to find out that astonishingly, Beck didn't even bother to obtain a university degree--and yet he lead his engineering teams to create his vision, making the most beautiful and awesome small-rockets (capable of LEO) in all of human history thus far! 

Again, the fact that he accomplished this without a degree in engineering or the sciences, only adds to the intrigue and awesomeness of his life story.

Is it possible to get an internship at RocketLab immidiately after high school?,"Hi,

I am greatly interested in possibly getting an internship at RocketLab.

From what I was able to find on the internet such internships exist, however, there are two potential problems that I am aware of. First, I am an EU citizen, but not US or NZ citizen (which as far as I know could disqualify me or at least complicate the process). Secondly, I am currently finishing high school and about to enter higher education in the field of aerospace engineering. In most cases internships are aimed at undergraduate students, however for example last year I completed a short internship at a GE turbojet testing lab, so it isn't always a problem.

So basically, where/when should I apply, and am I even eligible for such application?

Thanks in advance",28,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/bnhvu4/is_it_possible_to_get_an_internship_at_rocketlab/

&#x200B;

**Rocket Lab**: $4.1B valuation (post-merger), 17 successful orbital launches, 105 satellites placed in orbit, 3 more missions in Aug-Sept., NASA moon mission in Q4 2021, burgeoning space systems business, and 8000 kg payload Neutron launching in 2024. (Electron: 300 kg to LEO)  [https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/) 

&#x200B;

**Relativity Space**: $4.2B valuation, launching first orbital test flight this yr. (Terran 1: 1250 kg to LEO)  [https://www.reuters.com/technology/relativity-space-raises-650-mln-bigger-3d-printed-rocket-2021-06-08/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/relativity-space-raises-650-mln-bigger-3d-printed-rocket-2021-06-08/)  

&#x200B;

The point being, developing a successful rocket company is damn hard and many have closed up shop trying. What SpaceX has done to initiate this ""new space"" race is remarkable. What Peter Beck has done with Rocket Lab is also pretty damn remarkable considering where he came from and the fact that New Zealand had no space industry really to speak of.   

Investors are going to have to pay a premium to invest in a rocket company that is currently successful and is generating revenue now. Not all of the companies on this list will make it, and there are many more out there that are joining the game. So let's appreciate the ones that are already successful at this point.  

**Here's an analogy I like to use when people say that you should invest in Astra before Rocket Lab because they have half the valuation**: 

Why does Kevin Durant (small forward for the NBA's Brooklyn Nets) make $41M in the 2021-2022 season, whereas Cade Cunningham (#1 2021 NBA draft pick for Detroit Pistons) only gets paid $8.4M. Cunningham is an awesome basketball player and may one day be a max-deal player like Kevin Durant, but as of right now, he hasn't played a single game in the NBA. He has the potential to be great, but until he gains experience and proves himself, he's not as valuable to his team as Kevin Durant is to the Nets (or Team USA for that matter). Rocket Lab is Kevin Durant and Astra is Cade Cunningham in this analogy if you haven't put that together at this point. I do believe Astra will be successful in a couple of years, but there is no denying that Rocket Lab is 4-5 years ahead of Astra, and with the expansion of Rocket Lab's business into space systems and satellites, I think they widen the gap further between them and their competitors, while hopefully also narrowing the gap between them and SpaceX, the latter being the clear leader right now by a long shot.

&#x200B;

**Disclosure**: This is not financial advice. Invest at your own risk. I am invested long in Rocket Lab and Astra, but more heavily in Rocket Lab because of their multi-year track record for success. Could change depending on how the space economy develops.",103,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/p4gyip/relative_valuations_of_rocket_lab_and_closest/
RocketLab is officially American??,"I was looking up orbital launch statistics on Wiki and it had a graph of launches per country and RocketLab launches from New Zealand were included in the USA column. 

I checked and RocketLab was founded in NZ by a New Zealander then he moved the company registration to California but continues to operate the business in New Zealand. 

In theory this could be a tax thing like Amazon's head office is probably an uninhabitable rock off the coast of Iceland so they pay zero tax to anyone. But if it was then why pick USA as a tax haven instead of a dozen better choices. 

I wonder if it's because of that US military regulation about missile technology. That's why SpaceX can only hire US nationals to work on rockets but Tesla can hire anyone from anywhere. Maybe to be allowed to launch NASA payloads they needed to be classified as a US Business or something?

**Reused Rutherford Engine Successfully Flies on 40th Mission!** 

You   read that right! On August 24 (NZST), we successfully launched our  40th  Electron mission, called ‚ÄúWe Love the Nightlife,‚Äù for Capella  Space.  Not only did we deliver Capella‚Äôs satellite to orbit, but we  also  demonstrated some significant milestones in evolving Electron into  a  reusable rocket.¬†

For  the  first time, we reused a Rutherford engine that had previously flown  on  our ‚ÄúThere And Back Again‚Äù mission in May 2022. The engine worked   flawlessly on its second flight as it took Electron to space. Then the   first stage returned to Earth with a successful ocean splashdown in the   Pacific Ocean.¬†

Hot on the heels  of ‚ÄúWe Love the Nightlife,‚Äù we‚Äôre launching another  dedicated Electron  launch for Capella. The ‚ÄòWe Will Never Desert You‚Äô  mission is scheduled  for lift-off from Launch Complex 1 as soon as 19  September. The  mission will be our third launch for Capella this year ‚Äì  we're on a  roll! ¬†

Rise & Sign: New Launch Deals Signed!¬†

There   must have been something in the air in recent weeks¬†because we‚Äôve   announced 14 new launch deals across our Electron and HASTE (Hypersonic   Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron) programs. ¬†

Here‚Äôs a look at what‚Äôs to come:¬†

* [New HASTE launch](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=b94a56ef94&e=56a66a2a9a)   for an undisclosed customer to take place at Launch Complex 2 (LC-2)  in  Virginia in 2024. We successfully launched our first HASTE rocket in   June for Leidos on a mission called [Scout‚Äôs Arrow](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=1ab1127968&e=56a66a2a9a).

* [Four new HASTE missions](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=dd817b0cc7&e=56a66a2a9a) for Leidos under the MACH-TB program, scheduled to launch from LC-2 across 2024 and 2025. ¬†
* BlackSky,   a leading provider of real-time geospatial intelligence and global   monitoring services, which has launched on six Electron missions since   2019, [signed a block buy deal for five Electron launches](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=85cc888a2e&e=56a66a2a9a)   for their Gen-3 satellites beginning in 2024. Fun fact: BlackSky has   used Electron as a launch vehicle more than any other single commercial   customer!¬†¬†
* A new, double-launch deal with NASA to deliver their climate change research-focused mission, [PREFIRE](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=45378f0d66&e=56a66a2a9a),   is now scheduled to launch in May 2024. NASA's PREFIRE (Polar Radiant   Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment) mission will help close a gap in   understanding of how much of Earth‚Äôs heat is lost to space, especially   from the Arctic and Antarctica. This will be our 7th and 8th mission  for  NASA since 2018. (Graphic we made of 2 launches)¬†¬†
* Last but not least, [we signed a deal with Japanese Earth imaging company Synspective ](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=8e1595f672&e=56a66a2a9a)to   launch two dedicated Electron missions. Rocket Lab has been launching   for Synspective since 2020 when the Company deployed the first  satellite  in Synspective‚Äôs synthetic aperture radar (SAR)  constellation. Since  that first mission, Rocket Lab has been the sole  launch provider for  Synspective‚Äôs StriX constellation to date,  successfully deploying three  StriX satellites across three dedicated  Electron launches¬†

Rocket Lab Wins Industry of the Year Award for Stennis Location

Rocket Lab received the prestigious [Industry of the Year Award](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=42323fcd30&e=56a66a2a9a)   at the Hancock Chamber Business & Industry Awards Gala in August.   The annual awards recognize outstanding achievements in citizenship,   industry and business in Hancock County, Mississippi. ¬†  
We opened our  facility at the Stennis Space Center in 2022 and the site  will be used  to test the new Archimedes engines for the Neutron rocket  coming in  2024.¬†

When   we expanded our Space Systems division, we created a vertical   integration strategy where we could build essential elements of a   spacecraft for our own satellites and those built by others. The idea   behind this was everything going to space should have a Rocket Lab logo   on it!¬†

Speaking of‚Ä¶¬†                                      **NASA Psyche Mission** 

NASA‚Äôs  Psyche mission, which will orbit a metal-rich asteroid of the  same  name in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, is  scheduled  to launch in less than 30 days on 5 October 2023! ¬†

The spacecraft will use a huge Rocket Lab solar array that will power the spacecraft during its 4-billion-kilometer journey.¬†

**MethaneSAT Mission** 

MethaneSAT,  scheduled to launch no earlier than January 2024, is an  Earth  observation satellite that will monitor and study global methane   emissions to combat climate change. We are providing multiple elements   to make this mission a success including developing the Mission   Operation Center, the solar panels to power the spacecraft, and the   separation system that will eject the satellite to its orbit. This   mission is jointly funded and operated by the Environmental Defense   Fund, an American NGO, and the New Zealand Space Agency ‚Äì the country‚Äôs   first space science mission! ¬†

**Neutron Update**

Neutron,   our mega constellation launcher, continues its development on  schedule.  We‚Äôve now begun Stage 2 tank testing including cryogenic fill  and  pressure cycles to determine structural and sealing integrity and   performance, hydrostat test to prove the structural integrity of the   structure, domes, and hatches, and the fill, press, vent and de-tank   systems and procedures among other structural tests.

Our engineers are hard at work making Neutron a reality! [Learn more about Neutron.](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=cc5ff12d45&e=56a66a2a9a)",35,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/16hsph6/highlights_of_the_latest_developments_from/

You‚Äôve heard all the negativity being thrown at Rocket Lab‚Äôs ‚ÄòHumanity Star‚Äô. It‚Äôs time now for a little positivity.,"For those who claim that Humanity Star has no scientific value, I argue the point ‚ÄòWhy does everything in space need to be science related?‚Äô I was hoping we could have space tourism, orbiting hotels, and other non-science endeavors up there as well. Space is a big place. There is room for both. And for those astronomers who claim that it causes light pollution, I argue that it has no lights onboard. The only way to see it is from reflected sunlight. And when it is on the night side of Earth it won‚Äôt be reflecting any sunlight because it will be in the Earth‚Äôs shadow. The only chance you will have of seeing it at all will be around sunrise or sunset. And remember that all satellites reflect sunlight (even the science ones). Airplanes on the other hand do have lights onboard and are visible at night but astronomers don‚Äôt seem to be complaining about them. For those who claim that it is simply more space garbage, be aware that it was placed into an orbit that will cause it to burn up in about 9 months. So it cleans up after itself. And for those who will then claim that it‚Äôll still be ‚Äò9 months of space garbage‚Äô I say the following: Instead of the thousands of evil spy satellites that are up there continuously taking our picture, Humanity Star is peaceful. Nobody is making money off of it. It can be experienced by almost everybody on the planet. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre rich or poor. It doesn‚Äôt matter what language you speak. It doesn‚Äôt matter what skin color you have. It has the power to touch us all and make us smile. And if a little one meter wide carbon fiber ball has the power to do that then it is something wonderful! You can hate it if you want to but with so many bad things taking place around the world each and every day why would anyone choose to single this out?",95,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/7te4rr/youve_heard_all_the_negativity_being_thrown_at/

"Rocket Lab's path to Profitability: Increasing SolAero Gross Margins, Electron Recovery, and Responsive Launches","In Rocket Lab's [earnings call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE) yesterday, they made some very interesting statements about how the company plans to increase gross margins and achieve profitability.

First, Rocket Lab [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE&t=2622s) that increasing gross margin on AolAero is the best thing that they can do to improve profitability on the Space Systems side. Rocket Lab said that they have a 24 month plan to increase SolAero gross margins from ""high single digits"" to a whopping 30%! They said that they are very confident in this plan, and that executing on it is only a matter of time. Rocket Lab said that revenue from the acquired companies SolAero, Advanced Solutions Inc, and Planetary Systems Corporation was $28M in Q2 2022, and the vast majority (> $20M?) was from SolAero. Therefore, increasing the gross margin to 30% on SolAero revenue is a really big deal!

Secondly, Rocket Lab [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE&t=3102s) that for their new [Responsive Space Program](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-introduces-responsive-space-program/), the cost per launch is 15-30% higher than the typical Electron launch price of $7.5M, and the vast majority of that 15-30% markup goes directly to gross margin since most of their launch costs are fixed costs. Between Electron reuse (70% of cost is in the first stage) and responsive launches, I see a clear path to increasing the gross margins of Electron!

These statements really help to paint a clear path to profitability in my mind. With stronger than expected revenues and a clear path to profitability, it‚Äôs no wonder that Rocket Lab stock surged over 20% today. What do you guys think? What do you think Rocket Lab's plans for SolAero are? Increasing automation? Integration of solar panels into other components? Outsourcing of manufacturing? I sure hope it isn‚Äôt outsourcing, the United States really needs to manufacture its own solar panels.",72,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wmsfbg/rocket_labs_path_to_profitability_increasing/
12 years later and some thing's never change...,"
...and some thing's only get better.

Twelve year's ago Peter Beck and Rocket Lab first touched space with Atea 1, a sounding rocket that was never designed to go orbital.

Then a few day's ago Beck and the Rocket Lab team set a new company record for fastest turnaround between orbital launches. 21 days!

It's no surprise to see Becks instinctual celebration has stayed the same.

In this [video](https://youtu.be/ETEWnRsa_Ik) you'll see the launch of Atea-1. The first Rocket built by Beck and the early engineers at Rocket Lab as a private company. They started with resources provided by Mark Rocket and Sir Michael Fay. Let me get ahead of you, you're going to see and hear some funny stuff. A last second delivery to Beck from a helicopter(no wonder he likes them so much). You'll also hear a guy say ""did it go?"" Judging by Beck's double fists in the air, it go'd. The tracking components they used were faulty, so it was never found. But being a sounding rocket you get literal evidence. 

I noticed a familiar double fists in the air during the last launch. Late in the stream a curly haired figure steps in to check if both satellites deployed nominally. Go to [1:13:45](https://youtu.be/PmCl2Hs8enc) and tell me I'm wrong.

Both these rockets are mainly built with carbon fiber. I have heard Beck say he only uses carbon fiber. First stage, second stage, fuel tanks, wherever he can. I don't know how they get the fuel tanks to work, but they do. 

So now here they are twelve years later with a wealth of knowledge on launching rockets to orbit. Working with the same material the whole time. Then learning how that material reacts on re-entry. I wrote this because I want to hear some discussion on the future possibilities of ""Rocket Lab Carbon Fiber.""

I think that was part of the hardware we got with the Neutron Presentation. I don't care that it wasn't bolted  down, or that it was at room temperature. A falling rocket isn't bolted down. So was the i-beam the one way to mimic forces from hypersonic waves? The fact they are sticking with CF makes me realize they are trying to learn from modern airplanes to make the modern day rocket. Two more things that weren't physical hardware, but interesting concepts were the fairings, and the suspended second stage. Sure the perfect end would be Beck stepping into some fairings that close....but whatcha gonna do

I'm trying to get a better understanding of composite materials and found [this old lecture](https://youtu.be/V7bX4c9XWes). I didn't make it through the whole thing, just the first part before the more technical discussion. He brings up a key advantage is ""tailorable anisotropy"", I was wondering how that could help in Neutrons design? As well as the ability to manipulate the overall process so many different ways. What do you think the limits are of the chemistry of the resin? 

I thought this professor did a great job in the early part of the lecture. He made it fairly easy to understand. It's also seven years old and he's talking about getting his own automated fiber placement machine. So that technology must be further along.",73,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/re8re1/12_years_later_and_some_things_never_change/

While we're waiting for the *Still Testing* campaign, I thought this would be a good time to discuss this. I was going about my life today, thinking about spaceflight at work, and more specifically, the design and economics of Electron.

Before we get into it, it's clear that the cutting edge of commercial spaceflight is largely focused on reusability ([SpX](https://i.imgur.com/TN3BMsK.jpg), [BO](https://i.imgur.com/q7L3fTD.jpg), [ULA](https://i.imgur.com/wSkwzqD.jpg), [ESA](https://i.imgur.com/I9aTUWE.jpg)). Why throw your expensive rockets away after every flight? Obviously, it takes *enormous* resources to develop an orbital rocket, and even *more enormous* resources to develop reuse. For that reason, SpaceX remains uncontested in this arena. There are many ways to save money through reuse, however, and each have their own pros and cons.

Vertical self-propelled landing is obviously great because you recover the whole booster (I'll be ignoring second stages in this post). Another advantage for SpaceX is that're getting good at large-scale vertical rocket landings for their future launch vehicles. The disadvantages of this approach are that vertical landing an orbital rocket is *extremely* [difficult to do](https://youtu.be/bvim4rsNHkQ) and requires an *insane* amount of developmental resources. I love SpaceX and how incredibly lean they are, but the amount of money that even they spent to make Falcon 9 reusable will probably [never directly pay for itself](https://np.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/7kzabd/dr_spacex_or_how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and/) by recovering boosters. Plus, a vertically-populsively-landing vehicle has to be specifically designed for re-entry and the vertical landing process, cutting deep into payload margins. Operational costs of recovery, vehicle processing, and re-checking the whole rocket eat further into the profit margin. All-in-all, I don't believe this strategy would be viable for a small vehicle like Electron, and a young launch provider like Rocket Lab.

[ADELINE](https://youtu.be/tV29pEvZvZw) is another concept proposed by ESA where the rocket's engines (by far the most expensive part) pop off the booster and fly themselves to a nearby runway. This approach could be much cheaper than trying to revamp the whole vehicle to land vertically. Electric motors could draw power from the already-existing batteries, and wings/RCS wouldn't be terribly difficult to add. Some major problems with doing this with Electron are: where would it land? This would likely need a long runway within a fair distance to its re-entry area. Additionally, reentry would be around Mach 7. That complicates things *a lot*. So maybe ADELINE isn't the best strategy for Electron.

[ULA's SMART concept](https://youtu.be/lftGq6QVFFI), however, may be perfect for Electron. It adds minimal mass by eliminating the need for RCS by having a passively-stabilizing shape when deployed. It would only add the mass of a small, Electron-sized steerable parachute, re-entry shield, and separation system. Remember, [this really is a tiny $1M+ engine cluster](https://i.imgur.com/ffLJ6vz.jpg) we're talking about. As added booster mass doesn't tax the payload capacity nearly as much as anything on the second stage (8:1?), a lightweight hardware set along these lines could be technically feasible. As for the cost to recover, a fast helicopter could be purchased or chartered for mid-air capture and bring it directly back to Mahia or their HQ in Auckland. Or maybe a cheap plane could even be used in conjunction with some sort of ground-based capture system (or just reel it up to a mounted hardpoint on the plane under the belly). The (likely inflatable) re-entry shield would be pretty light too (again, think about how small of a vehicle Electron is) and some pretty off-the-shelf parachute gear could probably be used. Who knows, maybe an employee already has a plane that could be used to cut costs further. Or, since this engine pack is so small, maybe the inflatable reentry shield could function as a raft, assuming it's shaped well enough to keep water out. That would also eliminate the need for parachute steering, and could be picked up by boat. Surely someone at Rocket Lab has a boat. Anyway, I'm not going to go further into the design, as it's clearly within the realm of possibility.

Rocket Lab has said their Mahia launch site can support a launch every 72 hours (even wording that [""120 launches per year""](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/launch/launch-sites/) on their website) so clearly they want to launch a lot. Is throwing 10 engines away every flight really viable with a cadence like that, when reuse is an option? SMART reuse would really help eliminate the potential bottleneck of engine production for a pretty small cost.

Now, when I thought about this today, I thought that Rocket Lab was *probably* not pursuing reusability with Electron, because they have enough on their plate. Plus, an Adeline concept would be visible from the exterior of the rocket, and a SMART system probably would be too. Adeline would have static or fold-out wings, and SMART would probably need four sections (probably along the outer edge of the rocket) to either fire pyro bolts or extend pneumatic pistons. It'd also need a little bit of space in the mini-interstage to tuck a parachute and heat shield. I remember the press photos, specifically that the [entire exterior of the Electron is smooth](https://i.imgur.com/vb8dcrj.jpg) so that puts that idea to rest. Except, after looking at a couple photos of Electron, it turns out [that's not the case](https://i.imgur.com/RtC01FN.jpg).

On their [website](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/electron/), it shows the Electron with not only [unnamed hardware](https://i.imgur.com/ZnzHwTv.jpg) in 4-way symmetry, but what looks *suspiciously* like a small interstage. The large 4-way-symmetrical parts on the bottom of the rocket body are hard points for [hold down](https://i.imgur.com/Y2NiZFX.jpg) during launch. But the devices right above it look a *lot* like stage separation mechanisms. The symmetry is right, they *look like* some sort of stage attachment/detachment mechanism, and as silver bands denote interstages on the rest of the rocket, it's likely color coding. It'd also be pretty easy to ensure the project is secret until it goes live, as Rocket Lab is a pretty small company. 

Granted, it's likely that I'm wearing a tin-foil hat and pulled this all out of thin air. But then again, it would make a lot of sense. If they don't tell the public about booster reusability, they could just avoid the negative press and scrutiny during the development phase by not covering recovery operations. With [Lockheed](https://i.imgur.com/W91o30B.jpg) as an investor, they could very well have made their investment contingent upon Rocket Lab basically blazing the way for ULA (a joint venture of Lockheed/Boeing) to prove SMART with what basically amounts to a smaller proof of concept. Also, you could probably knock that development out with only a couple engineers. It would only take a few launches, presumably, to develop, and they could reuse 90% of all their rocket engines (the 10% being the basically-irrecoverable Vacuum Rutherfords).

So, what do you think, /r/RocketLab? Am I onto something, or *on* something?

Edit: Immediately after posting, I found [this photo](https://i.imgur.com/R2uQWUR.jpg) online. It looks like that is, indeed, an interstage, and those 4 points could very well be for engine cluster ejection. However, it looks pretty cramped, so the extra space for re-entry gear would need to be in the engine section. Based on my super-cheezy MS Paint skills and available images, [it looks like that stuff could fit](https://i.imgur.com/M2g3r5o.jpg). As far as the public is concerned, the [thrust plate](https://i.imgur.com/idlMQZb.png) on top of the Rutherford is the furthest up piece of the engine, except for plumbing. I bet a couple good engineers could work around that plumbing. Also, that being a separation point means that even if SMART hardware isn't currently on the Electron, it would be much easier to integrate it than if the outer body was a contiguous tube.

Edit2: It looks like [that](https://i.imgur.com/hxlsy6M.jpg), in fact, *is* the [the same separation bracket](https://i.imgur.com/E1JA6CI.jpg) used on the [upper stage](https://i.imgur.com/zOn18BX.jpg). Here's a [look at the back side](https://i.imgur.com/pgQ9Hps.jpg) of it. I really think I might be onto something, here.

Edit3: This theory could also align with their well-known [ITAR issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/5u4b88/rocket_lab_wants_to_stop_you_taking_photos_if_a/). If they have their recovery vehicle in the middle of the marine exclusion zone, they could basically be guaranteed that nobody could get their hands on their engines. All marine vessels in the area would be known during that time, and the odds of being struck by your own tiny rocket if it malfunctions are laughably small. Who knows, maybe the FAA/ITAR people *forced* them to recover their engines, to make sure they don't fall into the wrong hands.

Edit4: Here's an old article in which Beck says Rocket Lab is *not* pursuing [reusability](http://www.satellitetoday.com/launch/2014/10/23/electron-to-launch-at-least-once-per-week-says-rocket-lab-ceo/). While that's definitely a strong argument against my case here, I'd say that a lot can change in 4 years, and the Electron is now likely quite different than what it was in 2014. Interestingly, Lockheed seems to have invested in [2015](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lockheed-rocketlab/lockheed-invests-in-rocket-labs-u-s-unit-to-keep-pace-with-innovation-idUSKBN0LY21Y20150302), specifically because they ""saw potential applications for Rocket Lab‚Äôs technologies light lift, hypersonic flight technologies and low-cost flight testing."" and that ""Lockheed‚Äôs investment in the New Zealand startup was aimed at helping Lockheed keep pace with innovation across the industry."" AKA direct measures to compete with SpaceX, so maybe SMART. Not coincidentally, [2015](http://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Supporting_Technologies/LV_Recovery_and_Reuse_AIAASpace_2015.pdf) is the year that ULA announced SMART, so obviously it was on their mind at the time. If they gave Rocket Lab a couple million bucks to do SMART, ULA would save a TON in development costs, and I bet Rocket Lab would spring for it. I'd say this all aligns with my theory.

Edit5: [Tweeted](https://twitter.com/scottyp_bme/status/952010302064939008) at ULA's CEO Tory Bruno, who's tweeted me back before. Tin foil hat complete.

RocketLab Capsule,"Rocket Lab, during the investor day, presented some illustrations for a human capsule for Neutron. While presenting, the company was very clear that this was not a capsule announcement but they are looking into the topic.

However, what is interesting is the size of the capsule presented with a human for scale. (Another member made a post on how much bigger the capsule is relative to Dragon from SpaceX).

To investigate whether the illustration was a mistake, I did some digging using the 2nd illustration of the capsule with a docking station. I utilized the docking station as a measurement foundation and compared the illustration with a relatively similar picture of a Dragon with a docking station. Here is what I found (rough measurements).

1. RocketLab's capsule is rougly 2.6 times the diameter of the docking station.
2. Dragon is rought 1.8 times the diameter of the docking station.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

1. It seems like that RKLB did not make a mistake when they showed a human for scale. RKLB may indeed be planning a much bigger capsule than Dragon and Starliner. (RKLB rarely makes mistakes on slides and it would be unlikely they made the size mistake on two slides)

Counter-argument; Dragon and Starliner are rougly 12 tonnes. Neutron in expendable mode can deliver 13 tonnes to LEO. Therefore it would be unlikely that they are planning a larger capsule.

Counter-counter argument:

1. RKLB is known for innovation and it is likely that they with the technology of 2025-2026 could develop a much lighter capsule
2. Neutron's performance metrics are based on the rocket performing in a chill mode. More performance could be achieved by pushing the engines to near their limit. i.e. Neutron if need be could potentially deliver +20 tonnes to LEO.

Let me know what you think?

&#x200B;

Update:

ISS docking station actual diameter: 2.4 meters

Estimated dragon diameter: 4.3 (actual 4) meters

Estimated RKLB capsule diameter: 6.2 meters

I.e. my calculations are rough estimates but not far off.",48,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xnqpmj/rocketlab_capsule/
Rocket Lab's technological firsts - a comprehensive list,"Hey everyone,

it repeatedly happens to me that I talk to someone about how innovative Rocket Lab is and then the other one tells me about some first I didn't know about. Could someone please make a comprehensive list of all technological firsts Rocket Lab has achieved as of today (Sep 14, 2021)?

By technological I mean anything concerning design, production, hardware, software, and also possibly operations. I would not include pure business achievements like funds raised or anything related to the stock market (just in case they have any firsts in that category, which I don't know).

By first I mean either that Rocket Lab was the first entity to ever do something, or that they were the first ones to do something commercially, i.e. at scale and prospectively profitably.

By achieved I mean that they have actually done it, at least exemplary, and are not just planning to do it in the future.

Neutron crew capabilities,"Another poster in another subreddit stated that Neutron could put the weight of Soyuz into LEO and it got me thinking.  I hadn't considered that Rockelab could possibly straight up buy brand new Soyuz capsules from Energia to bootstrap Rocketlab's own human spaceflight program.

Russian engine manufacturer NPO Energomash has been selling Russian engines around the world for decades. China's Shenzhou human spacecraft is largely based off Soyuz. So its apparent that Russia has no problems selling their spaceflight hardware and designs to other nations. Additionally, engine sales and Soyuz seat sales are on the decline so Russia's spaceflight sector maybe more willing to do something like selling whole Soyuz to make up the budget shortfalls.

Soyuz capsule has a long heritage of successful work and it would allow Rocketlab to leapfrog into a whole new business of space tourism and possibly even go after future NASA Commercial Crew contracts.  Further cutting development time, there are hundreds of trained Soyuz pilots and commanders that are veterans of spaceflight in a number of government space programs around the world.

Neutron: so what's in the middle? :),"Was just re-watching Everyday Astronaut's interview with Peter Beck ([https://youtu.be/aXoXDp3j850](https://youtu.be/aXoXDp3j850)) and the main points that I could get were: fully reusable 1st stage; propulsive landing; different material selection from electron; potentially ""coming in hot"" without any propulsive slowdown (like Electron tests - 6:20+); rp1 + lox on both stages; didn't want to say cycle type but could be eletric-pump-fed (9:40+) although Beck's a fan of expander cycle too; 

then there's:

12:10 - EA: ""we couldn't help but notice there's 4 engines on the render and you're doing propulsive landing which would be rather difficult"" 

12:45 - PB: ""yeah well there could be something in between those 4 engines that you couldn't see as well.. potentionally"" and Peter wants the least amount of engines as possible (kind of confirming the 4)

&#x200B;

soo.... what's in the middle? :) here's my totally crazy uneducated guesses (my only qualifications being KSP and youtube):

* gas turbine electric generator (maybe even pressure-fed, monopropellant, for restart simplicity): makes enough power for electric-pump-fed cycle on 4 big engines, so no need for batteries, and on landing there's a bypass and it provides enough thrust to land?
* same as above, except even crazier - a drogue chute / parachute to slow down and then plop 6 little drone props open up and land it down (powered by the gas-generator)?
* just a single smaller engine?

&#x200B;

Running out of Toes First Stage Returns to Wellington,"The Seaworker appears to arrived overnight in Wellington and I found the ship on my walk this morning. It was berthed at a private dock which is also used by BlueBridge to park cars waiting to board the 8am ferry sailing.  I attempted to take a close up photo within the private dock but a RocketLabs staffer on board told me to go away.  Unfortunately, I got locked in the dock area and the staffer then found me. After a friendly warning, they arranged to let me out (phew). They did confirm the first stage was onboard and that AIS (the shipping tracker) had been turned off after they left the Chatham Islands.  A launch was then unloaded and then Seaworker went for a cruise around the inner harbour (presumably waiting for the Rocketlabs' truck to arrive)  and the photo was taken from the Clyde Quay Wharf public lookout.

How important is the upcoming Rocket Lab moon mission is? Am I missing anything?,"https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/lunar/

Scheduled in March of next year, Rocket Lab will launch a electron rocket with a Photon Lunar spacecraft that will carry a CAPSTONE to cis-lunar orbit to the moon.  


Why is this important?  

The goal is to insert a small sat into a near rectilinear lunar halo orbit - something that has never before been attempted before. 

It is important this succeeds for the future or the NASA moon artemis program as it will provide non-stop communication to the Gateway as there will be no blackouts like prior moon missions and it provides access to the entire lunar surface.

The CAPSTONE small sat will be delivered to the moon by a Rocket Lab photon spacecraft.  This photon spacecraft is what makes capstone possible and appears very unique and will help pay the way for the Venus mission.  Also if successful will lead to future customers signing up for Rocket Lab‚Äôs photon spacecraft.

CAPSTONE will be delivered to lunar orbit by the Photon spacecraft, NOT a kickstage or upper stage, but a spacecraft (Photon).  This will be huge to showing the world what the photon can do and will likely lead to more and more missions down the road.

Is Rocket Lab moving away from Matlab and towards Python in all jobs?,"Hi guys,

&#x200B;

I am thinking of going to uni this year and doing some ad-hoc courses in Python and data analysis to better prepare myself for some mechanical engineering roles in Rocket Lab. On many job listings, Python seems to be the sole requirement as far as data analysis goes.

&#x200B;

Does this indicate that Rocket Lab no longer is favouring Matlab and that I don't have to worry about taking Matlab courses to prepare myself better for some roles, such as in propulsion or thermofluids? Getting into one of these would be a dream!

Thanks in advance for all answers!

Cheers :)",29,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1aubbji/is_rocket_lab_moving_away_from_matlab_and_towards/

Advantages of being able to launch from anywhere?,"I have spent time over the past couple months studying rocketlab and their competitors.

One thing I noticed is that Astra (especially) and also Firefly CEOs kept talking about the need to be able to launch from anywhere.

Can someone explain to me what is the point of say doing mobile launches like Astra is planning to do?

Assuming rocketlab is able to launch in New Zealand in theory every 3 days, what would be the point from them to use a similar approach as Astra?

I feel having your private launch pad with a lot of available windows is the winning solution, but I suspect I could be missing something.

I would also believe that the management of a startup launching a satellite would mostly care about the orbit, not really where the satellite is launched from.

Are their any limitations out of launching from New Zealand? I‚Äôm thinking maybe many orbits aren‚Äôt available‚Ä¶?

Side note I realize there are covid restrictions out of New Zealand, but I would keep that out of the discussion.

Can somebody please explain the structure of ownership of Rocket Lab to me; is it a US company or a NZ one?,"When you search [Peter Beck on twitter](https://twitter.com/peter_j_beck?lang=en), in his description it says [rocketlabusa.com](https://rocketlabusa.com).

When you look at pictures of the Electron rocket on Rocket Lab's Instagram page; you will notice the US flag tends to be more prominent than kiwi iconography ([this](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3uyEEDnCl7/) or [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/ByWAPrKHgX0/) etc.)This page is also called RocketLabUSA, instead of just RocketLab.

On Rocket Labs wikipedia page it says the following:

>Rocket Lab is a private American aerospace manufacturer and smallsat launch service provider with a wholly owned New Zealand subsidiary.

I don't know what this means to be honest, and would appreciate it somebody could dumb down the business mumbo-jumbo for me.

* If Peter Beck founded the company, why is it an American company?
* Why are there two companies?
* Does one company own the other company?
* Is Peter Beck actually in charge or either of these?
* Does he own more than 50% of any company?
* Does he have to prioritize profit for shareholders, and thus be beholden to their demands?
* Does this mean he can't do what he wants?
* Who are the actual people in charge or Rocket Lab?
* Why do they have such a ~~hard-on~~ desire for making sure we all know its RocketLab**USA**.",33,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/dlx0ih/can_somebody_please_explain_the_structure_of/

Rocket Lab Fan App!,"Hi all,

I've been working on this project for several months now and im super excited to share it with you finally.

Rocket Lab Companion is the one-stop place to get everything Rocket Lab. Being a fan myself (obviously) I always want to know when things are happening; so I made this. The app includes things such as Electron statistics, launchpad information and previous/upcoming lanches. 

I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed developed it!

Over the coming weeks and months, I'm going to be adding to it further. Some features currently in the pipeline include:

* Launch Push Notification
* The ability to add launches to your calendar of choice. 
* A news section so you can keep up to date on the latest developments.

I'm always open to feedback and feature requests so shoot me a PM or contact me through the app if you have any ideas.

The app is completely free and always will be. It's currently only available on the Google Play Store, however, I'm looking into making it available on iOS in the coming months. Let me know if you want this! 

**Google Play Link**: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mozaa.rl\_companion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mozaa.rl_companion&hl=en)

Why use and Oxygen Rich Closed Cycle on Archimedes and not a Fuel Rich Closed Cycle?,Anyone understand why RocketLab hasn't used a fuel rich staged combustion cycle for their new Archimedes engine but is going with Oxygen rich?  From my very limited understanding (Everyday Astronaut school of Rocket Engine Cycles) is seems like once the fuel is CH and not RP1 the coking problems for a fuel rich pre burner disappear.  This problem must have been solved by SpaceX for their CH fuel rich pre burner on the Raptor.  But it seems that one of the big challenges for Raptor was SpaceX developing a new alloy for their O2 rich pre burner for Raptor.  Is RocketLab working on new alloys for this or has rocket engine metallurgy moved on since the start of Raptor development?,36,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xvqw1q/why_use_and_oxygen_rich_closed_cycle_on/

It's really a nice document, it has so many explanations on the different mission stages, the engineering of the rocket, payload configurations and something that I like a lot: a TON of pictures.

Anomaly Resolved,"The recent news about the 41st mission loss problem is quite satisfying! This combined with a new Electron launch window (Nov 28th '23 into December) is a strong signal.

The technical aspects must have been very difficult and hard to analyze and of course to solve.
I am just an interested engineer with no knowledge of rocket science, but the description is very clear and understandable.
With such information it is possible to learn something new (Paschen's Law). It's a great hobby to watch RocketLab at work :-)

RocketLab can be very happy with the result and look forward to the next Electron missions with great confidence.

## What is going to be on board for this flight?

The primary payload aboard this mission includes nine of the latest generation SuperDove satellites from Planet, the operator of the world‚Äôs largest
constellation of Earth-imaging satellites. Each of the nine SuperDoves in Flock 4e‚Äô will be integrated with and deployed from Rocket Lab‚Äôs Maxwell
dispensers, the industry‚Äôs lightest CubeSat dispenser in its class. Planet‚Äôs constellation provides medium-resolution global coverage that enables
researchers, students, businesses and governments to discover patterns, detect early signals of change, and make timely, informed decisions

Canon Electronics Inc.‚Äôs CE-SAT-IIB, was procured by satellite rideshare and mission management provider Spaceflight Inc. The mission objective
for the CE-SAT-IIB satellite is a technical demonstration microsatellite developed with a middle-size telescope equipped with an ultra-high
sensitivity camera to take night images of the Earth and small size telescopes which are suitable for CubeSat use.

Interesting Discussion (RocketLab/Astra/Relativity Space),"Here¬¥s an interesting discussion mainly by Peter Beck (CEO of RocketLab), Chris Kemp (CEO of Astra), and Muhammad Shahzad (CFO of Relativity Space).

[https://youtu.be/\_1LQWJJOpOg](https://youtu.be/_1LQWJJOpOg)

&#x200B;

Here are the most interesting/important parts:

  

(60 seconds) Beck losing it about Kemp¬¥s initial thoughts on Astra:

(175 seconds) Beck explaining why going public and why via SPAC:

&#x200B;

Some personal takeaways:

\-Beck seems like he doesn¬¥t like Kemp or Astra

\-Chris Kemp seems to be a very unsympathetic guy

\-Beck is the CEO/CFO likely feeling the most comfortable about his company and his decisions and thoughts being the most thought through

\-Shahzad being the CFO of Relativity Space probably wasn¬¥t their best guy for this discussion (Tim Ellis (CEO) would probably have been the better choice)

\-Financial guys are very Astra and Relativity Space focused while forgetting about the big winner in the room",63,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/pa9z5n/interesting_discussion_rocketlabastrarelativity/
