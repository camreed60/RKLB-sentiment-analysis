RocketLab employee,"We are down in Disneyland and were leaving Downtown Disney when I saw someone in a Tshirt with RL logo on the back and it said ‚ÄúMission Team‚Äù on the back.

Blue Origin VS Rocketlab Cost Per KG,"I have been a long-time Rocketlab supporter and investor and will be for the foreseeable future. I am curious though on how everyone feels about the eventual competition from Blue Origin. Blue Origin is projecting I believe around a $1500 cost per KG via New Glenn vs Rocket Lab's $3,846 per kg for Neutron. 

These both have a ways to go before being realized and I have a hard time believing that Blue Origin can meet that price target but one thing they can do is subsidize the cost via Bezos and drive out most of the competition.

Moat chat,"First off this ain't a DD. This is a motivational wake up to what is actually happening. 


Every month that rocketlab is running, is the moat.


This ain't a 7/11 franchise. This is a business that has all the knowledge and engineering to get to space. Every day, every week, every month something new is learned that gives them an edged. All the layers beyond just a rocket, rocketlab already is refining and gaining new plans and partnerships.


All their previous launches, all that experience, gaining customers, a proven track record, refining, adapting, tweaking, integrating. Rocketlab building parts, building platforms, launching, monitoring, landing, building a process, refining a process.


The amount of experience, retaining customers, providing new experiences and solutions for customers...


...that is the moat. Doing the hard thing, doing it well, and most importantly already doing it. There isn't hopium, there isn't promises, they are already doing it.


Others haven't even scratched the surface of what that all entails. They don't have all the additional staff, processes, customers, solutions, platforms, they are stuck on figuring out step one. They are blowing millions, billions, without even a foundation of a business yet.


Rocketlab is so far ahead that they have a wild tech/intelligence/platform moat that is still far unrealized compared to their stock worth.


I am actually incredibly excited because a lot of this is still to be discovered by others. You really need to grasp how much rocketlab has already accomplished and how fast they are moving on neutron and space systems. Like, this ain't a shop that sells loaves of bread(nothing against a good sour dough, promise). They made a business that escapes the atmosphere, literally leaving the planet to find new opportunities. That is something once only held by the wealthiest and most knowledgable countries. Now we have it from rocketlab, where we individually have the ability, through its stock, to be a part of it. Literally nerd heaven.


Owning some rocketlab stock puts us right there in time, in the history of humanity where we are transitioning to space. Like imagine what you can tell your kids, nephews and neices or grand kids.


The wonderful thing is, you don't even have to imagine, you just do it, and you are a part of all this. Own a piece of this awesomeness. Help make sure it all happens, promote it, champion it. 


I just don't even know what else to say!!! It's so damn exciting.

Let's just imagine... what happens to Rocket Lab post-contact from Aliens?,"I know it is a taboo subject with a million different theories or beliefs. With all the congress hearings lately claiming UAPs are real, they are here, they hypothesize how they work within our understanding of physics but all agree the technology is not ours.

Let's just play pretend and all of that is 100% real and all of a sudden some alien race made contact and we got access to their gravitational propulsion technology, and are able to travel between our atmosphere, space, other planets, etc all very fast.

Does Rocket Lab just immediately become obsolete and tank? I suppose even if we don't need launch vehicles like rockets, the satellite components business would still be in full operation and working.

Or maybe it is a massive catalyst in humanity's drive for space and motivation to become interplanetary. All of a sudden rocket launches and satellites are #1, 2 and 3 priority and get massive attention and funding.

I thought this would be a fun thought experiment and conversation if we all think outside the box and think open minded!

Where's the hop test vehicle?,"I am new to reddit but not new to NewSpace. I realize this is my first post and thus anticipate some downvotes.

I have a lingering thought. For Neutron reusability, where is the hop test vehicle? And if it is partially built, why has Rocket Lab not shared it's progress? Electron's 1st stage ability to come back to an area above the ocean via parachutes, to then be caught by a helicopter, was an interesting idea that never materialized. Bringing Neutron back to the Wallops pad, at a precise location, is much more challenging. And doing that landing on a floating barge is much more difficult. Why no word on the barge build?

So I wanted to buy rocket lab stocks and I am wondering are they planning to make weapons in the near future? Or will they stick to peaceful space stuff?

Edit: With weapons I am specifically referring to bombs or other devices designed to activly hurt or kill people. I am not talking about missiles in general. Also I don't care about it if the rockets accidently crash and hurt the environment. The earth will certainly carry on without us. However I think its immoral to take away life, as in killing humans. Therefor (and thats just personal, not judging investors) I don't want to invest in stocks that build weapons (specifically bombs or WoMD designed to kill humans). Excluding explosives that are not used to harm humans (nuking an asteroid flying towards earth or exploding a mountain to mine diamonds). I just don't want my invested money used to actively hurt other people. However I don't care about espionage, cars and engines that hurts the environment or climate change or something like that. As I said my morals are not high. Its just that I draw the line at bombing people. I know its irrational, but thats just how I think. I do not care about companies like TikTok collecting our data (cause honestly its your deserved punishment for consuming so much brainrot content)",0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1fks5jh/will_rocket_lab_make_weapons/

Any chance for consideration?  Rejected due to short jobs(Aviation background).,"I had applied for Vehicle Integration and got scheduled for a phone interview.  When the date/time came, I didn't receive a call but about an hour later got a message that RocketLab decided to go with NZ/Aus residents for the position.  Yesterday, I get a email about another job I had applied for(Reaction Wheel) that got filled and was telling me to basically reapply.  I see that Vehicle Integration is still up there so I inquired on whether I should reapply for that too.  The response I got was most of my recent jobs were too short and the team decided to move on.

I never got a chance to interview to explain that those were contract jobs in the aviation field.  They said they were looking for people that had +3yrs at one place but the last 7 years I just worked in aviation(though worked at Sierra Space and Huntington-Ingalls in that time span too), I think most I spent at one place was 2 years but we ended up getting laid off a lot when the job was done.

I hope what I'm thinking doesn't happen,"I have a theory about why Blue Origin might finally cancel the launch of the Rocket Lab probes.

It was recently revealed that Blue Origin had applied for a license from the FAA to ship the Blue Moon MK1 in March 2025. (https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueOrigin/comments/1eqf17f/blue\_moon\_mk1\_pathfinder\_net\_march\_2025/)

A few days ago Bloomberg revealed that the hardware of the second and third New Glenn ship had been damaged in internal company tests, if the report is accurate, BO only has a single New Glenn ship tested and ready to fly, with the urgency of BO to demonstrate their lunar rover for missions to NASA while Starship is in development, they may have their internal interests as priority. (https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/08/21/bezos-blue-origin-suffers-fiery-setback-building-new-rocket/)

Let us remember that the probes that Rocket Lab has manufactured are launch class D, low-cost and these can be delayed, since they are not an urgent priority like classes A and B would be.

These are my thoughts, maybe I'm wrong and everything is ready for launch, but if Blue Origin decides in the end that they will not be able to meet the schedule for the window, it is possible that they are considering this path of prioritizing their lunar module since they are very profitable missions that NASA spends a lot of money

Downward revision for Q2 launches?,"Hey everyone.

Ahead of earnings I've been doing some research. I'm fairly ok with this quarter earnings meeting the targets of 98m assuming the space system forecast was accurate. Traditionally they've been pretty close so maybe +/- 1m but overall they've had all successful launches done.

My issue is for the upcoming quarter. Didn't they guide for like 6 launches this quarter? And more so for the entire year it was around 22/24. I really don't think this seems feasible right now. 

A possible downwards revision in launches in the guidance could be bearish news for this stock right? We could take a big hit that basis?

A delay/downwards revision in launches is either due to the fault of customers not having satellites ready to go or just a big lag between when Rocket lab get the electron rockets ready for launch.

The other side is the good news which could be them saying they'd be able to hit the target launches and possible news of neutron.",8,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1chca1w/downward_revision_for_q2_launches/

I really hope Rocket Lab has some kind of ambition/plan for positioning itself to be a major player in the lunar economy. 

For now Electron and Neutron does give Rocket Lab some share, however, Neutron's 1.5 tons to Lunar Orbit is not nearly enough to compete in the long term.

Does Rocket Lab have a future with its space rockets?,"Many startups have emerged in this new boom in space exploration in the US, I think we are clear about who is the most influential in terms of rocket construction, SpaceX, Rocket Lab and Blue Origin.

But there is also a group of startups that are not interested in building rockets, because they are clear that they cannot compete with the main 3, so they are dedicating their efforts to trying to offer other services related to payload, saleslites, software, among others. . services that may arise, but we will not talk about them, we will focus on SpaceX, Blue Origin and Rocket Lab, which is what is expected of them in the coming years and this is where I want to make it clear that it is my perception that I will say to below and this may not happen as I will say.

To begin with, I think that SpaceX and Blue Origin have some points in common, not only does it have a strong backing of money, but its CEOs are people with certain power, who may have certain ties with politicians, this in some way . may influence certain future government contracts.

As for Rocket Lab, it is a company that comes from nowhere and is making its way with its own resources, this is where I want to remain skeptical, I don't know if Rocket is aware that it can be very difficult to compete directly with these 2 companies in the future, maybe I'm wrong, but I have the feeling that Rocket Lab will eventually focus on offering services like the other startups they mention at the beginning want to do and will slowly abandon rockets. This is what I perceive, in any case I would like to know how you see Rocket Lab in the future",0,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1bh6r7u/does_rocket_lab_have_a_future_with_its_space/

RocketLab should approach airlines to see if they can get ""venture capital"" from them to turn their carbon fiber and rocket building expertise into an airplane making startup. maybe start with a plane that is similar size as neutron (between a 737 and a 747), to make it easier to adapt.

I want an Electron Launch using 3D / Spacial cameras,If you are reading this Rocket Lab tech employees and want to get a bunch of people excited to watch a launch (I watch them anyway since they are fun) put some live feed 3D / Spatial cameras on the pad or set up one to record a launch and then allow viewing of it.  Be the first!  There are probably around 150K Vision Pros out now and there is lack of immersive content.  People love space and the few best apps available for the Vision Pro are centered around space since it‚Äôs beautiful to look at in 3D.  Duct Tape that Vision Pro to the rocket and send it into space and then post the video.

Rocket Lab should have a fair fight for success,"I don‚Äôt want a political post and I don‚Äôt know how to make this not become political but it is what it is‚Ä¶.

I love what Rocket Lab is doing.  They are putting up satellites for lots of different companies from different countries.  Their work is having a large positive impact for employees in New Zealand and in the U.S.  They are walking the walk and not just talking the talk like a bunch of these other professed space companies.  It just irks me that as Beck is doing what needs to be done to be successful, the CEO of their biggest competitor met with a presidential candidate today who is asking for money.  You know if that happens there will be an understanding that SpaceX gets even more preferential treatment than anyone else.  Business success should be based on the hard work of the employees and not backdoor deals.  Keep up the good work Rocket Lab.  Can‚Äôt wait to see you on the moon.

Neutron‚Äôs Use of Carbon Fiber,"Can someone help me understand why carbon fiber is being used for Neutron and not Starship? Why is it more cost-effective for SpaceX to use stainless steel, but Rocket Lab determined carbon fiber would be more cost-effective for Neutron? 

In terms of durability, will carbon fiber still allow neutron to be reused a high number of times? I‚Äôm especially curious about reusability because of Rocket Lab‚Äôs goal of eventually having the capability to relaunch within 24 hours. 

Is it also possible Rocket Lab is becoming increasingly better equipped to manufacture carbon fiber materials, and they‚Äôre capitalizing on this more than SpaceX?",31,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1b8721b/neutrons_use_of_carbon_fiber/
Estimating Neutron first launch date based on publicly announced milestones,"Reposting with some updates to assumptions, from a different account for privacy reasons. Calculations haven't changed, and reference data is shown in the table at the bottom.

A little out of interest and mostly out of boredom, I decided to collate some public statements around Neutron development milestones to estimate the delay to Neutron's first launch date. For this, I collected statements from:

* Presentations available on Rocket Lab's investor relations page
* Archived versions of the Neutron page on the Rocket Lab website

This work could be expanded significantly by trawling through videos, interviews, etc as well (but not by me, this was already only mildly less boring than what I was avoiding doing). It is only a very simple analysis, with some large assumptions being made. Of course, these are only adjustments to public timelines and contain no inside knowledge of Rocket Lab's schedules or internal estimates.

Here's a chart of the results up front:

[Chart of Neutron first launch date estimates. The x-axis is the date that the statement of a milestone was made \(either Archimedes first hot fire or LC-3 readiness\).](https://preview.redd.it/gx0p4rpf4mmc1.png?width=3126&format=png&auto=webp&s=f13b2973239623152232b2c6b00da92ff294b353)

There are two different estimates based on two different approaches for each public statement date:

1. Simple Delay - assumes the amount of work after the milestone date remains the same as the original schedule, and adds the delay to the original launch date of 31 Dec 2024. This means that if Archimedes first hot fire is delayed by one year, the first launch date is delayed by one year.
2. Proportional Delay - this assumes that the effort estimates for the whole schedule are off by some factor, and applies that factor to the remaining activities as well. I.e., if it takes twice as long to reach Archimedes first hot fire from project start, it will also take twice as long to reach first launch from project start.

There are obviously a fair few assumptions going into this very basic analysis:

* Archimedes and LC-3 readiness are on the critical path to first launch. This means any delay to either of these is a delay to first launch. None of the calculated dates above assume a delay in both, only one or the other (and all but one is based on a delay in Archimedes).
* It does not account for any ""accelerations"" such as the company throwing significantly more people or money at the program, purchasing more components rather than building in house, etc. It also assumes that any planned ramp up in personnel is included in the original timeline and any other timelines shared publicly by the company.
* It assumes publicly announced dates were the best dates known to the company at the time, and takes them at face value on this.
* These two models for estimating delay are valid.
* When milestones were only listed as being completed in ""Q3"", the latest date in that quarter or month was assumed.
* When milestones were listed on the timeline on the Neutron page (only sorted by year, but in order), best guess was applied for delivery date to try and be most reasonable.
* It includes all delays - including from changing Archimedes architecture and having to redo a bunch of work there.

**What does this tell us?**

Neutron is probably delayed based on the assumptions made here, without a significant change in approach or spend - this analysis estimates to 2026 in all likelihood. This isn't a validated approach to estimating first launch of a new rocket, so you could dismiss it entirely if you want.

I personally think the first launch will be somewhere in between the Simple Delay and Proportional Delay (a bit closer to the Simple Delay) as the company will be trying to accelerate as much as they can to recover the timeline, and the Proportional Delay estimates are therefore extremely conservative. But at this scale, it only takes a few simple mistakes to significantly delay a program, so who knows.

**If you wanted to take this further**

I would recommend two next steps:

1. Add in more information sources (interviews, podcasts, videos, info from Electron launch livestreams, etc)
2. Perform the same analysis for other companies' first rockets that have actually launched to roughly assess the validity or accuracy of the method

Tl;dr - just look at the pretty graph

Space Services,"Peter Beck pointed out in this last earnings call that ultimately the greatest TAM, and therefore revenue, will be space services. The big question is which service segment will solidify Rocket Lab‚Äôs future. In a lot of ways, I like that Beck very deliberately left it open. It‚Äôs entirely possible the most revolutionary space service has yet to be realized, and Rocket Lab will be positioned to take full advantage of the opportunity by the time it comes into sight. Any ideas what space services will evolve with the same explosive growth that a lot of information technology did over the past 20 years? 

We‚Äôre constantly reminded that ‚Äúspace is hard,‚Äù so I can appreciate that these things take time, but I really want to be able to envision what the next 20+ years looks like for space services specifically. ",35,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1b1s02u/space_services/

Has anyone else been getting emails from ""Rocket Lab"" saying they have positions open and would like to conduct an interview with me. It seems fine at first but the more I look at the paperwork and such I am pretty sure it is a scam that someone is doing. So if someone see's it be careful I doubt that it is the real company. I can attach a screengrab of the email I have got a few times now. Then once you answer the email like an automated one sends again saying to contact them through teams and to continue with the interview through there. I am pretty positive this is a scam but I haven't talked with them other than sending the first email.

"LC-1A vs LC1-B, choice of launch pad in New Zealand","RocketLab's first 23 Electron launches were from LC-1A in New Zealand.

In 2022 they finished construction of a new pad, LC-1B, near the original and intended to increase launch frequency. 

The next 15 New Zealand launches in a row were from LC-1B. (And some from a third launchpad in America). 

Why is there such a strong preference for LC-1B? Is it better than LC-1A in some way? Is LC-1A undergoing upgrades currently? LC-1B was built five years later so might be a better pad and they've gone back to make the same changes to LC-1A?    
Or is the plan to ignore LC-1A and stick to LC-1B, improve launch frequency with a better pad rather than improving frequency by using two pads? I did wonder if they were modifying the pad ready for Neutron but that's a much larger rocket so they'd probably need to build a whole new pad rather than upgrading the oldest one.

So what's happening with LC-1A? Is LC-1B just better?",18,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1axcf1c/lc1a_vs_lc1b_choice_of_launch_pad_in_new_zealand/

Is Rocket Lab moving away from Matlab and towards Python in all jobs?,"Hi guys,

&#x200B;

I am thinking of going to uni this year and doing some ad-hoc courses in Python and data analysis to better prepare myself for some mechanical engineering roles in Rocket Lab. On many job listings, Python seems to be the sole requirement as far as data analysis goes.

&#x200B;

Does this indicate that Rocket Lab no longer is favouring Matlab and that I don't have to worry about taking Matlab courses to prepare myself better for some roles, such as in propulsion or thermofluids? Getting into one of these would be a dream!

Thanks in advance for all answers!

Cheers :)",28,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1aubbji/is_rocket_lab_moving_away_from_matlab_and_towards/
How will more satellites improve my life?,"Peter Beck claims that the main purpose of going to space is to improve people‚Äôs lives here on earth. 

I understand that more and more satellites could improve the lives of people living in desolate areas, but I am wondering how more satellites will improve my life. 

How will more satellites improve the lives of people living in cities and right outside of the city? 

I am curious because if Rocket Lab could improve the lives of people in and around big cities then the market cap of this company will skyrocket.

Sources indicate that the customer is likely the Space Development Agency.," 

SDA, an organization under the U.S. Space Force, is building a mesh[ network of military satellites](https://spacenews.com/space-development-agency-renames-constellation-to-reflect-focus-on-u-s-warfighter/?preview_id=140632&preview_nonce=0118ef1bb4&preview=true&_thumbnail_id=141872) in low Earth orbit known as the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.

SDA Director Derek Tournear speaking at a conference earlier this month said the agency was negotiating a contract with an unspecified supplier for 18 satellites to expand the U.S. military low Earth orbit constellation.

One of the portions of SDA‚Äôs proliferated architecture is the [Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta](https://spacenews.com/space-development-agencys-data-transport-satellites-get-more-complex/), made up of communications satellites to enable beyond line-of-sight connectivity for military forces on the ground.¬†

Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta is projected to have 90 satellites. The agency in August announced it awarded $1.5 billion in contracts to Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman for 72 Beta satellites.

Tournear said Dec. 7 at a National Security Space Association event that SDA was planning to add another 18 Beta satellites to the constellation and was in negotiations with another vendor that he did not disclose.

The Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta satellites ‚Äî projected to launch in 2026 and 2027 ‚Äî will carry radios using the UHF (Ultra High Frequency) and S-band frequencies that military and intelligence units rely upon for voice and low-speed data transmissions.

‚ÄúWe are looking at putting another approximately 18 satellites on contract, and we‚Äôre working with a third vendor to do that, and we should make that announcement shortly,‚Äù Tournear said Dec. 7 at the NSSA forum.¬†

According to Rocket Lab‚Äôs SEC filing, the contract includes a base amount of $489 million, with incentives and options worth $26 million. ‚ÄúWork under the agreement will begin immediately with the delivery of the space vehicles to the customer for launch slated for 2027, operation of the satellites through 2030, and an option to operate the satellites through 2033.‚Äù

Why is RocketLab the only launch provider with a Photon equivalent?,"Photon is a really cool addition to RocketLab's Electron rocket.

It blurs the lines between being a part of the payload and part of the launch vehicle, in a way it's both at once. From the customer's perspective it must be really useful to have Photon as an option when launching your payload. It can provide extra thrust to reach higher orbits than Electron alone, or it can provide the orbit circularisation burn at apogee, in both cases removing the need for the payload to handle those burns and keeping the final payload mass low. But it's also a communications bus to talk to Earth, has precision guidance systems and star tracking to assist in those final burns, further reducing payload complexity.

I was looking up Photon to make this post and I discovered they've made it even better than I already thought it was. The CAPSTONE mission to the moon last year used an upgraded Photon with an upgraded engine. They're marketing it as a full satellite bus with solar panels and radio antennae for missions to Mars or Venus. I thought it was just the kick-stage for the last little nudge to the correct orbit, I didn't realise it was so capable.

Which feeds more into my question, why doesn't anyone else have a Photon equivalent?

RocketLab's website describes Photon as being ""Vertically integrated with in-house subsystems based on constellation-scale manufacturing capabilities"". Yeah, it's made by people who routinely make and launch rockets, uses known parts and subsystems with known behaviours and capabilities. It just makes sense that the rocket manufacturer can make a really effective satellite bus, especially for customers where this might be their first satellite. I wonder if the customer base of smallsat providers / first launches is why this is relevant for RocketLab but not SpaceX. In theory SpaceX make a bigger and better kickstage/satellite-bus with Draco/Superdraco engines and help people launch more capable satellites. But Falcon 9 is so much bigger that their customers are usually larger and more capable of managing their own payloads. Electron is so much smaller and more of their customers are smallsats / first ever launches and they need to lean more heavily on the launch provider.

It may also be that Falcon 9's second stage has excess capacity compared to Electron's second stage. Apart from Starlink launches very few Falcon 9 launches come within 20% of the max payload capacity so they just use the second stage for circularisation burns or finessing the orbital insertion. Electron can't do that because it's so close to the mass limits and it's more efficient to ditch the second stage mass and use a smaller kickstage for circularisation burns.

But I'm just guessing blind really. I'd like to see SpaceX develop a Photon equivalent for Falcon 9. Or someone else, maybe Stoke or Relativity Space or ISRO.",35,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/176zsgg/why_is_rocketlab_the_only_launch_provider_with_a/

**Reused Rutherford Engine Successfully Flies on 40th Mission!** 

You   read that right! On August 24 (NZST), we successfully launched our  40th  Electron mission, called ‚ÄúWe Love the Nightlife,‚Äù for Capella  Space.  Not only did we deliver Capella‚Äôs satellite to orbit, but we  also  demonstrated some significant milestones in evolving Electron into  a  reusable rocket.¬†

For  the  first time, we reused a Rutherford engine that had previously flown  on  our ‚ÄúThere And Back Again‚Äù mission in May 2022. The engine worked   flawlessly on its second flight as it took Electron to space. Then the   first stage returned to Earth with a successful ocean splashdown in the   Pacific Ocean.¬†

Hot on the heels  of ‚ÄúWe Love the Nightlife,‚Äù we‚Äôre launching another  dedicated Electron  launch for Capella. The ‚ÄòWe Will Never Desert You‚Äô  mission is scheduled  for lift-off from Launch Complex 1 as soon as 19  September. The  mission will be our third launch for Capella this year ‚Äì  we're on a  roll! ¬†

Rocket Lab has been launching   for Synspective since 2020 when the Company deployed the first  satellite  in Synspective‚Äôs synthetic aperture radar (SAR)  constellation. Since  that first mission, Rocket Lab has been the sole  launch provider for  Synspective‚Äôs StriX constellation to date,  successfully deploying three  StriX satellites across three dedicated  Electron launches¬†

Rocket Lab Wins Industry of the Year Award for Stennis Location

Rocket Lab received the prestigious [Industry of the Year Award](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=42323fcd30&e=56a66a2a9a)   at the Hancock Chamber Business & Industry Awards Gala in August.   The annual awards recognize outstanding achievements in citizenship,   industry and business in Hancock County, Mississippi. ¬†  
We opened our  facility at the Stennis Space Center in 2022 and the site  will be used  to test the new Archimedes engines for the Neutron rocket  coming in  2024.¬†

Thoughts on Ashlee Vance's new book?,"I just finished When the Heavens Went on Sale, Ashlee Vance's new book detailing Planet Labs, Rocket Lab, Astra, and Firefly. I read Vance's book on Musk when it came out and learned a lot from it. This new book had some really great history and details, and gives us a very inside view of the founding of these exciting companies. However, I must say it was relatively unbalanced. The section on Rocket Lab was short and sweet, and tried to include some negatives/controversies where there weren't really any. The other sections were rife with massive issues with the founders, conflicts, etc. I was honestly looking to learn about companies besides Rocket Lab so I could diversify my position in the space economy, but after reading I just want to hold RKLB more because the others have so many issues. The sections on Astra and Firefly seemed so hopeful, but blatantly ignored the reality that Rocket Lab has worked up a regular cadence with a flight proven vehicle while they are still floundering around.

I did learn some new stuff about Rocket Lab, like how the first electron launch when flawlessly and it was actually a US government software issue that caused them to terminate. What a shame. However, the section on Astra seemed really drawn out when it was effectively chapter after chapter of ""they tried to launch a rocket, it was delayed/blew up"" and especially knowing that they never got Rocket 3 to work and won't launch another rocket until 2025, when they're out of cash.

I think the main takeaway for me was how the US government has really muddled the space industry by overreaching. E.g. everyone at NASA having 0 vision besides Pete Worden, multiple agencies cockblocking Max Polyakov for being Ukrainian, and the restrictions on Rocket Lab's development given that most of it happens in New Zealand. 

I wanted to see what you all thought of the book, if you had different impressions, and just get a conversation going around it. While the book should get some more people looking at Rocket Lab, I think it really underplays their accomplishments while trying to inflate the progress of the competition.",22,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1526awp/thoughts_on_ashlee_vances_new_book/

# Introduction

With the 2024 first launch of the Rocket Lab Mega Constellation Launcher‚ÄîThe Neutron‚Äîfast approaching, I decided it is high time for a more up-to-date DD on Rocket Lab. A lot is happening in the industry, the company, and the world. I have decided to dive into the future, fundamentals, industry, funding, financials, dreams, and of course, the memes of the aspiring space company. Now, I am posting my DD into both of the Rocket Lab subreddit, as I am new to writing DD and I want to hit as wide of an audience as I can. One disclaimer (for those who do not like stock talk), this DD is not meant to encourage buying of the stock, nor is it financial advice or a stock-only DD, I merely want to dive into this company and simply spark some discussion on it!

Now, Rocket Lab is a private aerospace manufacturer and small satellite launch service provider. The company was founded in 2006 by Peter Beck and is headquartered in Long Beach, California, with additional facilities in New Zealand and Australia. Rocket Lab specializes in the development and launch of small rockets capable of delivering payloads of up to 300 kilograms to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab‚Äîself-designated as a leader in launch and space systems‚Äîis a company that has a chance at becoming a highly profitable giant over the next decade and beyond. In my honest opinion, Rocket Lab currently thrives off of the crumbs of the current space industry ecosystem. With Space X increasingly focused upon one goal‚Äîthanks to their controversial, yet nevertheless, fearless leader‚Äîbeing Mars, Rocket Labs can (and in my opinion will) become one of the go-to space companies for low earth orbit launches in the near term and in the long-term become one of the go-to space company for launches between the Moon, Venus, and Mars as well. Rocket Lab currently lives off of the crumbs left behind by NASA, Space X, and the United States military-industrial complex.

[  Like these two legends from the movie War Dogs, Rocket Lab is determined to become the go-to space company for transporting all types of goods into orbit. For those of you who have not seen the movie \(I personally highly recommend it\), essentially, when these two start their arms-dealing company, they focus upon all of the small contracts that the government is putting out for arms supplies. The contracts that the big players are ignoring, due to their small sizes, even so, these small contracts are worth hundreds of thousands to low millions. Now, this is where Rocket Lab currently lies in the industry.](https://preview.redd.it/j6wloa05vd4b1.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fc5120309359cb8789b861e68009133ef92d376)

[ \\""A new space race has begun, and most Americans are not even aware of it. This race is not \[about\] political prestige or military power. This new race involves the whole human species in a contest against time.\\"" - Ben Bova ](https://preview.redd.it/iliovpg7vd4b1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=f22e8c01f45a403829c6c681966f1a9a53fab213)

Now, before I dive into everything here, I need every to understand that this industry is on the verge of immense change and rapid evolution. We are currently in the first stage of the world‚Äôs Second Space Race. As a student of History, I can confidently tell you that there are murmurings within the historical community, that this is the case, beginning with the creation and success of Space X‚Äôs first reusable rocket: the Falcon 9. On December 21st of 2015, when the first Falcon 9 was launched and the landing was successful with the first stage fully recovered, the race began. In the same way that there is no single company above all others in the airline, shipping & transportation, or car manufacturing industries, is the same reason I do not believe that Space X will alone run the space industry‚Äôs transportation needs. There is plenty of room for companies like Rocket Lab to fill the gaps Space X cannot and in a decade‚Äôs time, there will be plenty of room for even more companies. Yet, there are no companies that are even close to competing with Space X‚Äîother than Rocket Lab‚Äîat this time. Now, I won‚Äôt go deeply into most of these competitors in this deep dive, but to be short, Astra is on the verge of total failure, Virgin Galactic has been playing an entirely different game‚Äîspace tourism, which there is a massive market for, just perhaps won‚Äôt be penetrated by them‚Äîthey likewise seem to be failing. While Blue Origin has been playing a strong game and Space X an even stronger one, albeit more and more focused solely on Mars as the years go on.

[ Here you can see the 1-year charts of Rocket Lab, Astra, Virgin, and Boeing for reference, as you can see, these charts speak volumes. Rocket Lab has been having a tough year but has found a nice bottom and is consistently bouncing from lows in the $3.6-4 range. While Astra has been reduced to a penny stock, with their future unknown. Virgin Galactic is only maintaining below Rocket Lab‚Äôs share price, partly due to the large number of Retail investors that do not know much and refuse to let it die, coupled with a small hope that the company can recover in the coming years. Boeing is here for reference as to what a successful, large-cap company involved in a similar industry \(and the space industry as well\), should look like over the course of a decent year. ](https://preview.redd.it/4lgxhawavd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d24878b2d7dc72b1e5c87ccd01d67c077485001a)

*Now, there are a few assumptions that I am making that we need to cover before diving into the real DD:* Whether it be because we live in the beginnings of a second Space Race (fueled by privatized space companies and the world‚Äôs governments) or because of technological advancement and a rising interest in space, the increase in rocket launches, space development (in Earth‚Äôs orbit, the Moon, and Mars), and the lowering costs of space launches‚Ä¶ it will become exponentially cheaper, easier, and faster to launch into orbit and the industry as a whole will have a massive boom‚Äîakin, in a way, to the industrial revolution‚Äîover the mid-to-late 2020s into the early 2030s. With the mid-to-end 2030s and early 2040s, we will see massive developments in terms of low-Earth orbit manufacturing facilities, tourist destinations, and stations, as well as settlements on the Moon for mining and refueling for greater exploration and colonization of the Sol System as a whole.

Now these are in part assumptions, but I think once one does the research and looks at the fact, all of this is very achievable. Even if it does not occur in this way, you can shift the dates by an additional decade and every time you do, the more likely, easier, and cheaper it all becomes.

Rocket Lab's business model revolves around providing cost-effective and frequent access to space for small satellite operators. The company aims to simplify the process of deploying satellites by offering dedicated launches on its Electron rocket. Rocket Lab operates as an end-to-end service provider, handling the entire launch process from mission planning and payload integration to launch and on-orbit operations.

# Section 1: Rocket Lab Takes Flight! The Electron & the Neutron

[  ‚ÄòRocket Lab is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, complete spacecraft design and manufacturing, satellite components, flight software, and an on-orbit management.‚Äô ‚Äì Rocket Labs](https://preview.redd.it/nbt3cd8dvd4b1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc518b0149113dc115f082394c2b6e8b33e36707)

Rocket Lab's primary launch vehicle, the Electron, is a two-stage rocket powered by Rutherford engines, which use electric-pump-fed LOX/RP-1 propellants. The Electron is designed to optimize cost, flexibility, and rapid launch capability for small satellites. Rocket Lab has demonstrated numerous successful launches since its inaugural flight in 2017, showcasing its technological prowess and reliability. The small satellite market has been growing rapidly, driven by increased demand for data collection, communications, and Earth observation. Rocket Lab's focus on dedicated launches for small satellites positions it well to capture a significant portion of this expanding market. The company has already established a solid customer base, securing contracts with government agencies, research institutions, and commercial entities.

Rocket Labs‚Äîat the time of writing this‚Äîhas had 37 launches‚Äîwith a 91.89% success rate‚Äîdeployed 164 satellites, operates 3 launch pads, and is maintaining 3 Photon Satellites in the Earth‚Äôs orbit. Of the 164 satellites launched by Rocket Labs, they were commissioned to do so by a wide variety of clients, from NASA, Space Force, DARPA, to Canon. Rocket Labs is supported by Future Fund: Australia‚Äôs Sovereign Wealth Fund, Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Data Collective, Greenspring Associates, ACC, Promus Ventures, L One W One Ltd., and Lockheed Martin.

Rocket Lab‚Äôs main rocket, the Electron‚Äîbuilt and operated by Rocket Lab‚Äîhas flown 37 times and been successful 34 times, with only 3 failures. Rocket Lab‚Äôs key areas of business penetration lie in the launch of mid-sized service rockets, the manufacturing of space systems and satellites, and their adept ability to manufacture industrial space parts, applications, and proponents. The latter of which, they are sort of unopposed in terms of competition.

The Neutron‚ÄîRocket Lab‚Äôs medium-lift, mega constellation launcher‚Äîwill be able to launch 13,000 kilograms into low Earth orbit and it will be ‚Ä¶drum roll please‚Ä¶ reusable! The current goal is for it to launch in 2024. It will be designed for not only low earth orbital supply missions, but also deep space missions, and even human spaceflight. It will be fairing a design allowing for full reusability of the first stage and it will be lightweight, being made of Rock Lab‚Äôs own carbon composite structure. The home base for the Neutron will be at the Neutron Production Complex and the launch pad at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility and Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.

[ ‚ÄòThe Neutron Production Complex will be home to a rocket production, assembly, and integration facility, as well as a dedicated launch pad for the Neutron rocket located on the southern end of Wallops Island. The estimated 250,000 square foot state-of-the-art complex will be constructed on a 28-acre site adjacent to the Wallops Island Flight Facility and will include a Launch Control Center, Rocket Lab‚Äôs fifth global operations center for launch activities and on-orbit operations. To support rapid production of the Neutron rocket, current plans for the complex include automated fiber placement robotic production systems capable of laying up meters of Neutron‚Äôs new, specially formulated carbon composite structures in minutes. As a reusable rocket, Neutron is designed to land back on the Launch Complex 3 pad after a mission and from there it would be returned to the production complex for refurbishment and re-flight.‚Äô ](https://preview.redd.it/k592skwfvd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=279742c6d6196d860258d747af98f84e71b71470)

With Space X dominating large-load space orbital flight and transportation, Rocket Labs, in my honest opinion, is where Space X was roughly something like 6-8 years ago. While Rocket Lab intends to compete with Space X‚Äîwhether it will be considered competition in an industry this brand new and small, time will tell‚Äîfor cargo and humans to the low Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and even Venus! Space X and Elon Musk have made it abundantly clear that the goal of Space X is the large-scale settlement of Mars. While later models of Rocket Lab‚Äôs Neutron will be able to go to Mars and Venus, it appears that is not their main goal. In the near term (being the next two decades), they will be looking to dominate the low Earth orbit and Moon market as well as the manufacturing of industrial space parts, applications, and proponents.

# Section 2: The Space Industry & Company Fundamentals

Rocket Lab faces competition from other commercial launch providers, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. However, the company differentiates itself by specializing in small satellite launches, offering a tailored solution for this niche market. Rocket Lab's Electron rocket provides the advantage of dedicated launches and the flexibility to reach specific orbits, making it an attractive option for small satellite operators.

Rocket Lab has raised significant funding through various investment rounds, securing capital from venture capital firms, strategic partners, and government entities. Notable investors include Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Lockheed Martin. The company's ability to attract substantial investment indicates confidence in its business model and growth potential. Rocket Lab operates within the regulatory framework of the countries in which it launches its rockets. The company holds necessary licenses and approvals from government agencies, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Compliance with safety regulations and adherence to environmental guidelines are crucial aspects of Rocket Lab's operations.

Despite its achievements, Rocket Lab faces several risks and challenges. The space industry is highly competitive, and the success of the company depends on its ability to secure launch contracts and maintain a steady launch cadence. Regulatory changes, launch failures, or delays could impact Rocket Lab's operations and reputation. Additionally, the emergence of new technologies or market disruptors could pose a threat to the company's market position

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room, the Quarterly Results. To preface, negative quarterly results mean‚Äîpardon my French‚Äîjack-shit (at least in the short term) for a company such as Rocket Lab, that is looking at penetrating a market such as the space industry. We are going to look at the past four Quarterly Results in chronological order.

**Q2 2022 Report:** Rocket Lab achieved record revenue of $55.5 million, showing significant growth compared to the previous quarter (36% sequential growth) and the same quarter in the previous year (392% YoY growth). Despite the revenue growth, the company reported a negative EPS of $-0.08, indicating a net loss for the quarter.

**Q3 2022 Report:** Another record revenue was achieved, reaching $63.1 million, with a sequential growth of 14% and an impressive YoY growth of 1,093%. The company's EPS improved slightly to $-0.07 but still remained negative. The fourth quarter revenue is expected to be lower, ranging between $51 million and $54 million, as a launch customer's push extends into 2023.

**Q4 2022 Report:** The company's revenue for Q4 reached $51.8 million, showing a healthy year-over-year growth of 88%. The full-year revenue for fiscal 2022 amounted to $211 million, reflecting substantial growth of 239% compared to the previous year. The EPS remained negative at $-0.08.

**Q1 2023 Report:** The revenue for Q1 2023 was $54.9 million. Increasing revenue by 35% in the first quarter of 2023. Revenue from their launch business was $19.6 million, up $12 million from the prior quarter. Their EPS was $-0.08, indicating strong maintenance of their business. The second quarter is expected to show a significant revenue increase, with an estimated range of $60 million to $63 million.

Now, what does this all tell us? Firstly, they were very forthcoming with the quarterly expectations. Something one might think is not a big deal, but considering how a lot of publicly traded companies operate, this is a good thing. In each of their earnings reports, they have nearly exactly estimated their results, showing they are not attempting to mislead investors. The company has experienced impressive revenue growth throughout the reported quarters, indicating strong market performance and demand for its products/services. However, the negative EPS values suggest that the company is still operating at a net loss. From a shareholder‚Äôs perspective, the company's focus should be on achieving profitability and reducing the negative EPS, while maintaining consistent revenue growth. In my opinion, this stock is sitting just below a fair market value for what it is right now, sitting at just over $4, considering they are not fully profitable. Yet Rocket Lab continues to grow its business, making more contracts, and it stands a competitive chance. If they can turn a profit within 2-3 years, I think they will be one hell of a company. With their competitors failing left and right and none finding the success as Rocket Lab‚Äîother than Space X‚Äîthey could stand to be a massive company in a few decades, so massive, they‚Äôre bigger than Earth.

One last financial point to touch upon‚Ä¶ shorting, so here is some data, which is roughly one month outdated due to my difficulty in finding up-to-date information on the company without a Bloomberg Terminal (So, if anyone on the sub has access to a Bloomberg Terminal and would like to add to my DD in the comments, please do).

**Last Record Date:** May 15, 2023

**Outstanding Shares:** 478,660,000 shares

**Float Size:** 262,310,000 shares

**Short Percent of Float:** 9.80% (The short percent of float represents the percentage of shares available for trading that have been sold short).

**Average Trading Volume:** 4,044,396 shares

**Current Short Volume:** 25,710,000 shares

**Previous Short Volume:** 24,630,000 shares

**Change Vs. Previous Month**: +4.38%

**Dollar Volume Sold Short:** $111.58 million

**Short Interest Ratio / Days to Cover:** 7.7 (This ratio indicates the number of days it would take for the short sellers to cover their positions based on the average daily trading volume.).

The short interest in Rocket Lab has increased from the previous month, with a change of +4.38%. The short percent of the float is 9.80%, indicating that a significant portion of the available shares for trading has been sold short. Now, Rocket Lab‚Äôs short interest is relatively low for a company that has had consistent negative EPS and revenue. Showcasing that the big players in markets either A) believe this company will make a massive turnaround in the near future (1-3 years mark) or B) Rocket Lab, due to its size, is thankfully not on their radar. However, that said, the off-exchange short percentage is 57.69%, showcasing that A) public on-exchange short volume is a complete hoax and Hedge Funds, and other big players are beating down on the stock or B) all of this information is completely misrepresented to retail traders on purpose and the entirety of the United States market system is a complete farce.

# Section 3: Future Prospects & Big Moves

Rocket Lab has demonstrated strong performance and growth potential in the emerging small satellite launch market. The company continues to refine its launch processes, aiming to increase launch frequency and reduce costs further. Additionally, Rocket Lab has plans to develop a larger reusable rocket called Neutron, targeting the medium-lift market segment, which would expand its capabilities and market reach. The company has the potential to be the go-to company for low Earth orbital launches in the short term and in the long term, one of, if not the go-to company, for transportation to the Moon, Mars, and Venus.

[  Peter Beck, founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, did an interview last month on his take on the industry and their future prospects. I wanted to touch briefly on this \(you can find the video on YouTube\).](https://preview.redd.it/ced7t9iivd4b1.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=6579fcd100b405f44d1e65fb13cb185cefe6ed76)

Firstly, the video begins with the commentator stating, ""*With the Space Race this week*,"" the Space X rocket, the most powerful ever built, has scrubbed its launch. While Rocket Lab is adding a new service for testing hypersonic sub-orbital launches, being a welcome addition to the company‚Äôs wide array of services. Beck states that it is a very exciting time, stating that ‚Äú*the United States is kind of lacking behind in hypersonic technologies and this is a great opportunity to have high cadence, test flight environment for these payloads to really move forward the US‚Äôs hypersonic research*.‚Äù He goes on to talk about how these capabilities are essentially repurposed from Rocket Lab‚Äôs Electron Rocket capabilities: ‚Äú*We take a standard Electron orbital-class launch vehicle and we fly it in some really unique trajectories to provide these hypersonic trajectories‚Ä¶ it is taking an Electron and making a couple wee tweaks to it and having a great high frequency hypersonic testing platform that hasn‚Äôt existed*.‚Äù Beck goes on to speak on the launch cadence ‚Äú*being on target for 15 flights*‚Äù this year with the fastest turn around this year being 7 days between flights, saying ‚Äú*the machine is cranking and the vehicles are flying successfully and the last flight was a reusable vehicle and we splashed that down successfully and now we‚Äôre kind at the point where we are recycling and harvesting engines and components off of those launch vehicles and getting ready to put them back into service and re-fly them*.‚Äù He continues, stating, ‚Äú*I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm allowed to say exactly, but‚Ä¶ a whole multiple gambit of reused components that are all now re-entering the production line and going back into service*.‚Äù Morgan Brennan, the interviewer then speaks to how there is this emerging mismatch between supply and demand when it comes to the satellite launch market, with the fact that there are so many satellite constellations that are poised to go into orbit in the coming years and not enough capacity in terms of launching them. So, she then asks about the reusability of Electron and the development of the Neutron. Beck states that, ‚Äú*Electron is really serving that market very well, and there are lots of flight opportunities that are sort of just doing its thing, Neutron is the new flight opportunity for us‚Ä¶ 2026 to 2030 timeframe there is a massive deficit in launch and there are lots of constellations that are all really vying for an ability to get in orbit, so we saw that coming and started work on the vehicle and hopefully we can bring it into service in 2024 and really solve some of those problems and take advantage of that market opportunity*.‚Äù

Now, I don‚Äôt have to tell you all that this is very good to hear from Beck and this is very exciting, showcasing that he really believes Rocket Lab can penetrate this market and become a big player in the ever-evolving industry.

**Rocket Lab Making Big Moves Lately:**

¬∑ Bought Virgin Orbit HQ in California, this was a big win for the company, and folk on the sub were very excited to see this happen. Yay! But, sad and unfortunate for Virgin Galactic, which I am sure many of us space enthusiasts had higher hopes for, oh well, not everyone can achieve their dreams.

¬∑ Rocket Lab reached a new Company record of nine launches within a calendar year.

¬∑ Achieved a record of 100% mission success for Electron launches for the year.

¬∑ Successfully launched CAPSTONE mission to the Moon for NASA, including the first demonstration of Lunar Photon spacecraft platform.

¬∑ Successfully deployed two satellites to space for NASA‚Äôs TROPICS mission on the first of two dedicated launches on Electron for the constellation scheduled in May 2023.

¬∑ Secured another NASA mission to Electron‚Äôs 2023 launch manifest with its Starling mission. Rocket Lab was selected by NASA to launch the Starling mission on an expedited timeline due to long delays and uncertainty with the mission‚Äôs original launch provider.

¬∑ Signed multiple new launch contracts on Electron for 2023 for undisclosed commercial satellite customers previously manifested on another small launch vehicle, demonstrating Electron‚Äôs strong position as a reliable and dependable ride to orbit for small satellite operators.

¬∑ Introduced Rocket Lab‚Äôs new HASTE launch vehicle, a suborbital testbed launch vehicle derived from the Company‚Äôs Electron rocket to provide reliable, high-cadence flight test opportunities to support the development of advanced hypersonic systems technology.

¬∑ Announced that the Company will fly a pre-launched 3D printed Rutherford engine on an upcoming mission in Q3‚Äô23, a major step in evolving the Electron launch vehicle into a reusable rocket.

¬∑ Delivered financial results that exceeded the high end of prior guidance for revenue and gross margin.

¬∑ Launched three successful Electron missions in the first quarter for commercial constellation operators HawkEye 360, Capella Space, and BlackSky.

¬∑ Successfully completed the Company‚Äôs first launch from its U.S. launch site, Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2, at the Virginia Spaceport Authority‚Äôs Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on January 24, 2023. The mission deployed three satellites for radio frequency geospatial analytics provider HawkEye 360.

¬∑ Successfully completed the Company‚Äôs fastest turnaround between launches to date ‚Äì just seven days between its 34th Electron launch, ‚ÄúStronger Together‚Äù, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 in Virginia on March 16, 2023, and its 35th Electron launch, ‚ÄúThe Beat Goes On‚Äù, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand on March 24, 2023.

¬∑ Rocket Lab remains the only U.S. commercial small launch provider to successfully deliver satellites to orbit in 2023. Secured a multi-mission contract with Capella Space to launch four more dedicated launches on Electron in 2023.

¬∑ Achieved programmatic milestones for the Company‚Äôs two Photon spacecraft to support NASA‚Äôs ESCAPADE mission to Mars, and for the Photon spacecraft for a Varda Space Industries‚Äô mission to manufacture high-value products in zero gravity. Both Photon programs include Rocket Lab star trackers, reaction wheels, solar panels, flight software, and radios ‚Äì demonstrating the value and strength of the Company‚Äôs vertical integration and in-house supply chain.

# Conclusion: An Ode to Humanity's Future

Rocket Lab has established itself as a leading player in the small satellite launch market, offering dedicated launch services tailored to the needs of small satellite operators. The company's technological capabilities, solid customer base, and innovative approach position it well for future growth.

Those who lived and grew up in the 1960s and 1970s believed that by the 21st century, mankind would be a space-faring civilization. People had a fascination with the unknown. It was embedded in pop culture, in movies like the 2001 Space Odyssey, Alien, and the Star Trek series. But the unfortunate truth is that after Apollo 17 on the 19th of December 1972, mankind has not left low-earth orbit. The American public lost interest, the government cut funding, and the Saturn V rockets were dismantled and replaced by space shuttles in the 1980s (spaceships not even built to leave low-earth orbit). The curiosity and desire to unravel the mystery of the universe are now again filling the hearts of people. Technology is becoming more advanced and cheaper.

With companies like Rocket Lab and Space X, the future is looking bright. We currently live in an era of mass information. One of the hardest aspects of life in the early-21st-century is learning how to filter all this information. The news of the accomplishments of Rocket Lab, Space X, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA), the European Space Agency (ESA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Space Force, are lost in the large volume of collective data. The average person does not believe how close we are to colonizing Luna and Mars; how close we are to becoming a multi-planetary species. If you walked up to someone on the street of New York City, today, and told them that in the mid-2040s, and by the latest, the 2050s, there will be hundreds if not thousands of people living in Earth's orbit, the upper atmosphere of Venus, the Moon, and Mars, the person would dismiss you in disbelief. But the same would have happened if you walked up to a person on the street of New York City on the 19th of July 1962 (before Kennedy‚Äôs speech) and told them that mankind would step foot on the moon in seven years. Companies like Rocket Lab, which will make orbital flight and transportation affordable, will allow for a new era of civilization, one which was only present and dreamed of in science fiction of the past.

[The Earth, as imaged from the Voyager 1 spacecraft, was suspended in a sunbeam, as the interstellar craft exited the Sol system in 1990. Earth is nearly 4 billion miles away in this image. That is us. That is humanity, all of us that have thus far, ever existed. We take to the stars in search of not only answers but in search of a purpose.](https://preview.redd.it/hnr23odlvd4b1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=298a1ee80b0bc5e3dc0ba5c3c61aa6a25c0682c1)

Would large amounts of LEO satellite constellations in the future cause implications?,"Provided that in the next 5-10 years we see a huge push into satellite mega constellations, IOT, and other space (or LEO) services, is their any implications that this may cause which would drawback or slow down the industry? 

One of the concerns I have is if enough LEO satellites are out there would this cause any issues to existing GEO/MEO satellites being blocked that many people rely on? Also would a large push in this industry cause enough space trash that it would start to be an issue?

Just wanted to open up the discussion or if anyone has heard any concerns or answers to concerns. This post isn‚Äôt for the purpose of doubting the industry or rocket labs as a whole.",25,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/140bibg/would_large_amounts_of_leo_satellite/

Rocket Lab to launch 2 missions for NASA hurricane-watching constellation,,116,9,https://www.space.com/rocket-lab-launch-nasa-tropics-hurricane-watching-satellites
Neutron launching Kuiper Satellites for Amazon?,"Hi All,

I was thinking, what are the chances for Amazon awarding launch contract to RocketLab Neutron for its Kuiper Satellites?

RocketLab is already going to deliver reaction wheels (2-3K a year) for Kuiper. RocketLab also recently launched a high-volume star tracker (maybe also for Kuiper). All in all, seems like RocketLab is going to do a lot of work for Kuiper. Then why not launch also?

Amazon did sign launch contracts with Vulcan Centaur (ULA), New Glenn (BO) and Ariane 6 (ArianeSpace). All these medium to heavy lift launch vehicles are delayed and won't see a multiple launch cadence before 2025/2026. It is even questionable whether ULA and ArianeSpace can achieve a high launch cadence as their vehicles are expendable.

Amazon Kuiper is in a hurry to catch up with starlink, so they do not really have the luxury to wait. Therefore, I think there a good chances that RocketLab will get launch contracts from Amazon Kuiper. Neutron could potentially launch 4 or more times in 2025 and then scale rapidly from there i.e. providing Amazon Kuiper with better performance than all of the current launch contract holders.

A Neutron rocket could put roughly 18 Kuiper satellites (700kg per satellite) in orbit per launch at a price of $50 million. $ per kg will definitely be lower than with Vulcan Centaur and Ariane 6.

Speculation on the long-term evolution of commercial launch in this decade (with an eye towards heavy lift as well as Relativity Space),"Hey all,

Just thought I'd put this out there as purely hypothetical (borderline tinfoil) speculation on what could happen in the years to come as the commercial launch market continues to evolve.

First off, a fun thought exercise - what would you name a potential heavy-lift launch vehicle that Rocket Lab could develop after Neutron?

Peter Beck has mentioned recently that they have no plans on retreading the rocket development path, but if SpaceX manages to get the Starship system operational this decade and it disrupts the industry like everyone thinks it will, Rocket Lab may be forced to adapt once again.

In that case, after looking at a variety of options, I personally like Hadron^1 the most. It already has name recognition thanks to CERN's Large Hadron Collider. Additionally, the neutron itself is a member of the hadron class of subatomic particles.

So, not only would Hadron be a logical progression from a particle physics perspective, it would also have instant name recognition. Just imagine: ""Rocket Lab's Hadron Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle"" - rolls off the tongue rather nicely eh?

Second, I got to thinking about consolidation in the commercial launch sector moving forward, as an economic downturn looms and we exit the near-zero interest rate environment that led to the previous decade's boom in launch startups. Many executives in the industry ([including Beck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qcHd13G6yQ)) have made public statements about this in the past couple of years.

Other small launch newcomers already have strong ties to large defense primes that may suggest acquisition down the line (e.g. Lockheed Martin with ABL and Northrop Grumman with Firefly)

The only two remaining non-""billionaire funded"" U.S. commercial LV players with significant financial runways are Rocket Lab and Relativity Space.

I've read previous threads on this sub discussing Relativity and the sentiment seems to be that despite the fact that they've yet to launch, they are a competitor worth paying attention to due to significant private investor interest, high quality talent (mostly ex-SpaceX), and potentially game-changing proprietary tech.

Once again, if Starship proves to work as advertised, and/or macroeconomic conditions continue to deteriorate, market participants may be forced to consolidate in order to survive. Precedent is currently being set in the satellite operator space as multi-billion dollar players have begun M&A processes under growing pressure from Starlink (e.g. Oneweb / Eutelsat and Viasat / Inmarsat). While less common, we've also previously seen consolidation in the launch industry, with Lockheed + Boeing's ULA JV, Airbus + Safran's ArianeGroup JV, and Orbital + ATK's merger. Aerojet Rocketdyne's recent tie-ups with Northrop and L3Harris also come to mind. Granted, each of these cases is unique, but anything is possible in this space, regardless of how large or established a company is.

Thus, I see no inherent reason why a Rocket Lab + Relativity merger couldn't be possible down the line, assuming both companies continue to grow and execute at pace. (A major assumption, to be sure!)

I realize this is probably the last thing on either company's mind at the moment but hear me out. Below is a big picture list of observations on both companies, with an emphasis on their similarities and potential synergies:

- Co-location at NASA Stennis for both companies' next-generation reusable methalox engine testing: Both Aeon R and Archimedes test complexes will be located fairly close to each other at Stennis. I wouldn't be surprised to see some degree of cross-pollination between the construction, engineering, and technician staff across both programs
- Both companies are vocal champions of additive manufacturing techniques throughout major components of LV production
- Both companies' headquarters are located just 3 miles away from each other in Long Beach
- Rocket Lab has proven to be a pragmatic, execution-rich organization. Relativity has proven to be a forward-looking, ambition-rich organization. Combining these modalities could in theory lead to an organization greater than the sum of its parts - SpaceX, the current market leader, has both of these elements in spades
- With Neutron, Rocket Lab is optimizing for operational efficiency with partial reusability and RTLS as their north star, whereas with Terran-R, Relativity is leaning on highly novel structures with full reusability as their north star. If Relativity manages to crack the full reusability problem at sub-Starship scale,^2 both companies' tech could combine in a unique way for a joint RL/RS designed heavy lift vehicle (possibly the Hadron as spitballed above)
- Both companies have good design, PR, and marketing (see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2GT204CEVk), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aJ5NPt5fSM), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kwAPr5G6WA), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BhkjEc6Q64), and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Vf3MlbtAs)), which helps excite the general public and attract talent

Curious what everyone here thinks of both the HLV name brainstorm and a potential team-up with Relativity. Obviously there is an extremely low chance of either happening in this decade, but it's fun to think about as these companies race to develop vehicles that will ultimately launch next-gen constellations, commercial space stations, interplanetary missions, and much more.

Footnotes

1. Some alternatives: Graviton, Baryon, Fermion
2. Stoke Space's [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzqhZLgpiv0) also claims to have cracked the full-reusability problem but they are much earlier-stage and have less funding at this point in time. Definitely worth keeping an eye on though.

Addendum on March 6th 2023: This post has been brewing in my notes for over 3 months. Today an article just came out on [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/the-gold-rush-for-the-next-round-of-military-launch-contracts-has-started/) with the following quote that piqued my interest:

"With Starshield, SpaceX readies for battle","PURSUIT OF DEFENSE DOLLARS
What SpaceX has done with Starlink is to visibly demonstrate how commercial space technology serves national security applications, said Peter Arment, aerospace and defense industry analyst at Baird investment bank.

‚ÄúThis helps SpaceX obviously but also helps the entire industry attract investment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe defense spending space is sort of a rising tide at the moment.‚Äù

Before anyone had ever heard of Starshield, other companies in the space industry started making moves to be better positioned to compete in the national security arena.

Commercial launch provider and satellite manufacturer Rocket Lab on Dec. 1 announced it is establishing a U.S.-based subsidiary for defense and intelligence work, including classified programs.

The new business, called Rocket Lab National Security, will have ‚Äúclose engagement with U.S. government customers to understand their mission requirements, which may be dedicated rapid call-up launch, satellite design, build and integration, spacecraft operations or all of the above,‚Äù Rocket Lab spokesperson Murielle Baker said in a statement.

Tess Hatch, vice president of Bessemer Venture Partners, a Rocket Lab investor, said the mood has shifted from a year ago ‚Äúwhen investors in boardrooms were pounding our fists on the table saying ‚Äògrowth at all cost.‚Äô‚Äù Defense customers can be ‚Äúa little lumpy and unpredictable. However, there are massive potential contracts,‚Äù Hatch said Dec. 6 at the TechCrunch Space conference.

‚ÄúWith markets down and maybe commercial needing to push a little more throttle, the diversity of the customer base is so important,‚Äù Hatch said. ‚ÄúThe government is extra helpful for space companies right now when the commercial side isn‚Äôt as efficient.‚Äù",26,3,https://spacenews.com/with-starshield-spacex-readies-for-battle/

Electron will deploy three satellites for radio frequency
geospatial analytics provider HawkEye 360. The
mission will be the first of three Electron launches for
HawkEye 360 in a contract that will see Rocket Lab
deliver 15 satellites to low Earth orbit between late
2022 and 2024. These missions will grow HawkEye
360‚Äôs constellation of radio frequency monitoring
satellites, enabling the company to better deliver
precise mapping of radio frequency emissions
anywhere in the world.

## Quick Facts
+ This will be the **32st** **Electron** from **Rocket Lab's LC-1**.
+ This will be the **9th** Launch for **Rocket Lab** this Year.
+ The Rocket is made out of **2** liquid-fuelled stages and **1** liquid-fuelled kickstage.

[](/# MC // section mission)
# Primary Mission: Deployment of payload into correct orbit

Electron will carry a science research satellite by
space systems provider OHB Sweden for the Swedish
National Space Agency (SNSA). The Mesospheric
Airglow/Aerosol Tomography and Spectroscopy
(MATS) satellite is the basis for the SNSA‚Äôs science
mission to investigate atmospheric waves and
better understand how the upper layer of Earth‚Äôs
atmosphere interacts with wind and weather patterns
closer to the ground. MATS was originally due to fly
on a Russian launch service before the mission was
manifested on Rocket Lab‚Äôs Electron.


The Swedish National Space Agency, SNSA, is a central
governmental agency under the Ministry of Education
and Research. SNSA is responsible for national and
international activities relating to space and remote
sensing, primarily research and development.
The mission‚Äôs science partner is the Department of
Meteorology at Stockholm University (MISU).

[](/# MC // section landing)
# Recovery Attempt

Using a modified Sikorsky S-92 large helicopter, Rocket
Lab will attempt to capture the Electron rocket‚Äôs first
stage mid-air as it returns from space after launch.

Time for Rocket Lab to re-consider air-captures?,"So, given that the last two air-capture attempts both ended in failure, I feel it might be time for Rocket Lab to re-consider it's re-usability program. Earlier this year, Rocket Lab managed to [succesfully re-ignite a first stage engine](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/01/rocket-lab-fires-up-its-first-recovered-engine-on-track-to-full-booster-reusability/) after it was retrieved from the ocean. This suggests that air captures may in fact be unnecessary and instead of further promoting the company to investors, it is actually acheiving the opposite effect due to the [negative media coverage](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/04/business/rocket-lab-helicopter-booster-catch-scn/index.html). My personal recommednation would be to cancel the air-capture attempts and retreive all future booster stages from the ocean using the retreival vessel. This avoids putting lives at undue risk for publicity purposes while still enabling the company to re-use the first stage engines. The helicopters can be re-tasked to spot the landing locations of the booster stages for the retrieval vessel.",0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/yme706/time_for_rocket_lab_to_reconsider_aircaptures/

Why use and Oxygen Rich Closed Cycle on Archimedes and not a Fuel Rich Closed Cycle?,Anyone understand why RocketLab hasn't used a fuel rich staged combustion cycle for their new Archimedes engine but is going with Oxygen rich?  From my very limited understanding (Everyday Astronaut school of Rocket Engine Cycles) is seems like once the fuel is CH and not RP1 the coking problems for a fuel rich pre burner disappear.  This problem must have been solved by SpaceX for their CH fuel rich pre burner on the Raptor.  But it seems that one of the big challenges for Raptor was SpaceX developing a new alloy for their O2 rich pre burner for Raptor.  Is RocketLab working on new alloys for this or has rocket engine metallurgy moved on since the start of Raptor development?,42,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xvqw1q/why_use_and_oxygen_rich_closed_cycle_on/

Rocket Lab to fire up first tests of new engine next year - CEO,,92,5,https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/rocket-lab-fire-up-first-tests-new-engine-next-year-ceo-2022-09-30/
"~600 kg, RTLS, multi-core, Electron++ ?","~600 kg to LEO, RTLS, multi-core, Electron++ ?

 &nbsp;

**Rationale**

* Competitors are aiming for this payload class, Astra, Virgin Orbit, Firefly (1,000 kg), Terra 1 (1,500 kg)  
* MDA, with RocketLab, is building 500 kg satellites, could be launched by RL  
* Gain RTLS [propulsive landing] experience  
* Gain landing leg experience  
* Gain relight experience 
* Retain staff building rockets for potentially more customers
* Use returned boosters to increase launch cadence


 &nbsp;

**Proposing**  

* Triple booster first stage, no staging  
* Double second-stage or single extended  
* Landing legs for RTLS  
* Maybe larger fairing with dual second stage with interstage  


 &nbsp;

**Possible configuration**  

* Triangle configuration of boosters (no staging), with landing legs, nosecone on one of the boosters  
* Inline configuration of two second stages (no staging) mounted on two of the boosters
* 1 m  or 2 m fairing (which would require new molds) plus funky interstage


 &nbsp;

**Discussion:**  

* A triple booster should have enough reserve propellant and thrust to lift the RTLS propellant, legs and account for extra drag.  Either triple-engine landing or dual-engine landing possibilities (depending on landing mass).  
* A dual booster would mean unmodified second stages fastened together, provide thrust needed for up to 600 kg to LEO.  
* A payload interstage would be needed.  
* Could call it Anion (extra electrons)",0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xt9yt3/600_kg_rtls_multicore_electron/

RocketLab Capsule,"Rocket Lab, during the investor day, presented some illustrations for a human capsule for Neutron. While presenting, the company was very clear that this was not a capsule announcement but they are looking into the topic.

However, what is interesting is the size of the capsule presented with a human for scale. (Another member made a post on how much bigger the capsule is relative to Dragon from SpaceX).

To investigate whether the illustration was a mistake, I did some digging using the 2nd illustration of the capsule with a docking station. I utilized the docking station as a measurement foundation and compared the illustration with a relatively similar picture of a Dragon with a docking station. Here is what I found (rough measurements).

1. RocketLab's capsule is rougly 2.6 times the diameter of the docking station.
2. Dragon is rought 1.8 times the diameter of the docking station.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

1. It seems like that RKLB did not make a mistake when they showed a human for scale. RKLB may indeed be planning a much bigger capsule than Dragon and Starliner. (RKLB rarely makes mistakes on slides and it would be unlikely they made the size mistake on two slides)

Counter-argument; Dragon and Starliner are rougly 12 tonnes. Neutron in expendable mode can deliver 13 tonnes to LEO. Therefore it would be unlikely that they are planning a larger capsule.

Counter-counter argument:

1. RKLB is known for innovation and it is likely that they with the technology of 2025-2026 could develop a much lighter capsule
2. Neutron's performance metrics are based on the rocket performing in a chill mode. More performance could be achieved by pushing the engines to near their limit. i.e. Neutron if need be could potentially deliver +20 tonnes to LEO.

Let me know what you think?

&#x200B;

Update:

ISS docking station actual diameter: 2.4 meters

Estimated dragon diameter: 4.3 (actual 4) meters

Estimated RKLB capsule diameter: 6.2 meters

I.e. my calculations are rough estimates but not far off.",48,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xnqpmj/rocketlab_capsule/

Rocket Lab will design its own crewed spacecraft?,"It seems that yes

(NOTE: Although some say that Rocket Lab does not intend to design a manned capsule, but will only have human qualification, the reality is that Peter Beck talked about a manned vehicle, and what the safety systems would be like, he said they would remove the fairing from the vehicle).

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcuOSXjevGs&t=2337s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcuOSXjevGs&t=2337s)

&#x200B;

I will now explain why I believe Rocket Lab will design its own manned spacecraft, and will not use Soyuz spacecraft.

&#x200B;

\-Rocket Lab has recently announced that they plan to deliver cargo around the world, (sort of like E2E).

So obviously they will design a re-entry vehicle...then they could adapt it for the manned missions they have announced.

\-If Rocket Lab were to buy a Soyuz capsule, they would be using Russian technology... and there are problems with Russia.

They would also be wasting money if in the future they want to build their own capsule....

And there are many other factors...

\-The Starliner can't be launched on Neutron in the reusable version, and besides, the starliner doesn't even work lol....

\-In the future there will be several space stations, and RL will not be left behind.

Also, for now Europe doesn't have its own spacecraft, the Susie spacecraft is under development, and according to what ArianeGroup has announced, operational flights will arrive in 2030.

So RL could develop a capsule or support body to sell seats to Europe.

\-The small spacecraft could also serve as a reusable second stage and RL would have a fully reusable multipurpose vehicle.",45,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xivd25/rocket_lab_will_design_its_own_crewed_spacecraft/

Why re-usability isn't a priority for Rocket Lab..,"Some people in the investor group I am a part have been asking why Rocket Lab doesn't seem to be prioritising re-usability. The problem with Electron is that it was never originally designed to be re-usable. The company also [over-estimated demand for the small launch industry](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/peter-beck-explains-why-electron-may-only-ever-launch-10-15-times-a-year/) and thus is producing Electron rockets at a faster rate than they are being used. Therefore, re-usability currently serves no purpose other than to boost the company's reputation. I suspect they also do not want another failed catch as this could damage the company's reputation and leed to a loss of confidence amoung investors. Personally, I suspect Rocket Lab will eventually do away with in-air captures and simply retrieve the first stages out of the ocean.",18,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xfgnjx/why_reusability_isnt_a_priority_for_rocket_lab/

Can Rocket Lab Replicate Starlink-TMobile Arrangement?,"I was fascinated by the latest announcement of an agreement between Starlink and T-Mobile, for  globe-spanning cellphone service coverage:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5DdP9uvkEs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5DdP9uvkEs)

This will surely be a Killer App for SpaceX's upcoming Starship launch vehicle, deploying their upcoming Starlink v2 satellites into orbit. There will surely be a demand for this type of communication network if it works as advertised, fulfilling the promise of what Iridium was supposed to be.

I was wondering whether Rocket Lab with its own in-house expertise from its family of satellite component builders might be able to come up with a comparable solution as this. Something like that would surely create demand for Neutron's launch services, especially with the rapid launch turnaround Neutron is meant for.

So Neutron obviously won't have a fairing as large as Starship's, but could some of the well-known origami techniques be used to create large unfolding antenna arrays that could snugly fit into Neutron's payload fairing for launch? Elon Musk said Starlink v2 would be using the world's most advanced Phased Array antennae, which could both detect the comparatively weaker signals from cellphones and compensate for Doppler frequency shift. Is anything like that within the capabilities of Rocket Lab or its family of subsidiary companies?

Surely a globe-spanning mobile cellular telecom network would be the ultimate demand-driver for the kind of launch cadence Neutron aspires to.",28,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wzw1lb/can_rocket_lab_replicate_starlinktmobile/

Rocket Lab Q2 Summary ‚Äî Smart and Scrappy R&D Sets Them Apart From Competition,,19,2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oc2QQIbso
"Rocket Lab's path to Profitability: Increasing SolAero Gross Margins, Electron Recovery, and Responsive Launches","In Rocket Lab's [earnings call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE) yesterday, they made some very interesting statements about how the company plans to increase gross margins and achieve profitability.

First, Rocket Lab [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE&t=2622s) that increasing gross margin on AolAero is the best thing that they can do to improve profitability on the Space Systems side. Rocket Lab said that they have a 24 month plan to increase SolAero gross margins from ""high single digits"" to a whopping 30%! They said that they are very confident in this plan, and that executing on it is only a matter of time. Rocket Lab said that revenue from the acquired companies SolAero, Advanced Solutions Inc, and Planetary Systems Corporation was $28M in Q2 2022, and the vast majority (> $20M?) was from SolAero. Therefore, increasing the gross margin to 30% on SolAero revenue is a really big deal!

Secondly, Rocket Lab [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE&t=3102s) that for their new [Responsive Space Program](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-introduces-responsive-space-program/), the cost per launch is 15-30% higher than the typical Electron launch price of $7.5M, and the vast majority of that 15-30% markup goes directly to gross margin since most of their launch costs are fixed costs. Between Electron reuse (70% of cost is in the first stage) and responsive launches, I see a clear path to increasing the gross margins of Electron!

These statements really help to paint a clear path to profitability in my mind. With stronger than expected revenues and a clear path to profitability, it‚Äôs no wonder that Rocket Lab stock surged over 20% today. What do you guys think? What do you think Rocket Lab's plans for SolAero are? Increasing automation? Integration of solar panels into other components? Outsourcing of manufacturing? I sure hope it isn‚Äôt outsourcing, the United States really needs to manufacture its own solar panels.",74,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wmsfbg/rocket_labs_path_to_profitability_increasing/

Neutron could end-up becoming the go-to for defense contracts?,"Although Neutron is arguably an engeering marvel, I fully expect the launch vehicle to get outcompeted in commercial space sector by the Terran R & New Glenn heavy-lift launch vehicles developed by Relativity Space and New Glenn, respectively. Relativity Space [has already lined up a series of launches for it's Terran R rocket valued at around 1.2 billion](https://www.relativityspace.com/press-release/2022/06/30/terranroneweblsa). Blue Origin's New Glenn [has been selected by Amazon to carry out at least 12 launches for project Kuiper](https://www.blueorigin.com/news/amazon-selects-new-glenn-for-kuiper/). Rocket Lab on the other hand, has no publicly stated launch contracts for it's Neutron Rocket. However, it has been [awared a contract by the U.S Space Force to develop the Neutron upper stage worth approx 24.35 million](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-wins-24m-u-s-space-force-contract-to-develop-neutron-upper-stage/). It seems from this that Rocket Lab has already missed out on a number of cruicial launch contracts from the commercial space sector. Though they have been recognised by the U.S Space Force and with their recent Electron launches for the NRO, it is possible that Neutron may be selected as the go-to for the defense sector in the United States. With rising geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and now Taiwan, it would not surprise me if the majority of Neutron's launches were comprised of defense contracts provided by the U.S Space Force, NRO and possibly others.",28,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wlist1/neutron_could_endup_becoming_the_goto_for_defense/
"My gut feeling: Solaero acquisition was a mistake, and perhaps a very bad one","I expressed a lot of concerns back in December about that acquisition:
 - 5 % gross margins: there is not really any cost savings with this acquisition. Why not just buy the solar panels directly from a third party, just like I assume spaceX does??? SpaceX doesn‚Äôt seem to have any issues sourcing solar panels!
 - Massive 60 % expansion of headcount at rocketlab
 - Rocketlab has 0 experience in solar panels construction
 - Massive distraction on top of the many challenges the company already faces 

To the list above we can now 
 - add a massive market meltdown
 - runaway inflation, which likely is going to be a big deal when selling something manufacturing intensive with 5 % gross margin

Was this acquisition motivated by the revenue increase from the low margin solar panels? I sincerely hope not. Because here‚Äôs the deal: most investors don‚Äôt give any multiple multiple to this.

I listened to the earning call today‚Ä¶ and I can‚Äôt help but feel that my concerns were warranted. Very negative contribution to gross margins.

Photon will need an upgrade to be a servicer tug, better engine, and robotic arm. Instead of pumping fuel, I like quick exchange of fuel tanks, less mess. This means someone has to build a tank farm in several orbital planes.

Building satellites  on orbit may give Electron new life, ferrying new components to old satellites. Reaching GEO with the weight/ mass of a big reaction wheel may be out of reach, but new sensors should be doable.

Is Relativity Space overpromising?,"I acknowledge that this is a bit of a rhetorical question, because RS hasn't launched yet, but that's kind of the point. They haven't launched Terran 1 yet, but they've announced plans with insane deadlines to send a second generation launch vehicle that's going to be as big as Starship to Mars (and beat SpaceX there, no less). Somehow, even though they haven't launched anything, they have enormous amounts of funding and a [pad at Cape Canaveral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_Space#Cape_Canaveral_LC-16). They will be having the [first launch](https://www.spacelaunchschedule.com/launch/terran-1-maiden-flight/) of Terran 1 later this month.

If RS is as good as they claim to be, then they would obviously be a threat to RKLB, which until now, has been second best next to SpaceX, and the best space launch investment option on the public markets by far.

At the same time, I see the wild claims that RS makes, and it makes my bullshit detector want to go off. Sure, RS has cool 3D printing tech, but does that really qualify them as rocket designers? Rocket engineering is notoriously hard. Announcing ambitious plans and timelines for a second generation vehicle when you haven't even launched one of your first generation vehicles reeks both of arrogance and of inexperience. It seems pretty obvious that they will want to make many changes to the design of their vehicles and iterate.

Technology wise, I get that they have a cool metal 3D printer, but it makes me cringe every time I hear them say that their technology is powered by ""AI"". To me, that says that the company is relying on buzzwords to lure naive investors that have no understanding of the technology involved. We also know that their rocket is not, in fact, fully 3D printed. I personally doubt that their construction method is particularly cost-effective, but that remains to be seen.

This last point is debatable, but I also feel like the relatively large size of the Terran 1 rocket is an error. It's a fairly large two-stage vehicle. If you've ever used a 3D printer, you know that the time needed to print something increases rapidly with the size of the object. Having a large rocket means that your prints take much longer, which in turn means that you iterate quite a bit slower. RS could have chosen to start by printing a smaller suborbital rocket so they can really test their technology, iterate rapidly on design changes, and then go for an orbital vehicle when they have more experience. Instead they're directly going for a large two-stage rocket and trying to launch it to orbit. If they need to iterate on this, it will take longer and be more costly.

RS is having their first launch later this month. Maybe they'll succeed and we'll all be really impressed that they've nailed it on their first try. Or maybe Terran 1 will blow up, there will be months of delays after that, and we'll eventually find out that RS has more in common with Nikola than SpaceX.",39,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wiex5n/is_relativity_space_overpromising/
Rocket Lab Constellation,"Do you think that Rocket Lab will unveil more about their planned constellation during the Investor Day? Surely they must already be working on it from a business case perspective.

If yes, what kind of constellation do you think Rocket Lab will build? broadband, connectivity, observation etc.?

Rocket Lab generating negative revenue on Electron Launches?,"Hey, so I'm part of a small investor group on Discord which follows space stocks. Recently one of our members [revealed that Rocket Lab is operating electron launches at a net loss](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/998003492503421018/1005151082512662588/IMG_0619.png?width=1200&height=301). He came to this conclusion after digging around in the quarterly earnings reports which report revenues and expenses related to launches and then counted the number of launches in that quarter by referring to Rocket Lab's [completed missions](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/) page. Now obviously, this may not be entirely unexpected for a company that is still relatively new. However, I find the lack of transparency regarding this issue concerning. Investors should not have to go to this level of detail just to uncover that a company is generating negative returns on launches. Obviously, they are generaing revenues from their subsidiary companies as well as the sales of [reaction wheels](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/space-systems/satellite-components/reaction-wheels/) and [star trackers](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/space-systems/satellite-components/star-trackers/). Hopefully, as launch cadence improves and re-usability becomes more streamlined, the company may end up breaking even. Don't get me wrong, I love what Rocket Lab does (it's amazing), but I just feel a little.. annoyed that Peter Beck hasn't stated that they are generating negative revenues from the launches.

&#x200B;

Additional information regarding calculations:

1. CoR = Cost of Revenue r/L = Revenue per launch CoR/L = Cost of Revenue per Launch
2. \*\*\*\[***4:33 AM***\]\*\*\*I don‚Äôt know what was going on in Q3 21\` so I pulled that out of the margin calculation, since it felt like an outlier. With that in, margin would have obviously been MUCH lower.
3. \*typo in chart. Should be $7344 not $6578 for CoR/L Q1-22",0,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wj1e77/rocket_lab_generating_negative_revenue_on/
"So now that Astra won‚Äôt be launching anything until probably 2024, what does this mean for Rocket Lab?","Astra has [cancelled](https://spacenews.com/astra-cancels-rocket-3-to-focus-on-larger-vehicle/) the Rocket 3 program and says they won‚Äôt launch any customer payloads until around 2024 when Rocket 4 is ready. Personally, I think Astra will go bankrupt before Rocket 4 is ready. The issue is that Astra is burning through their cash at a rate of $85M per quarter, have zero revenue, and have only $200M in cash left. I don‚Äôt see any good way for Astra to raise more money, either. At the time of this posting, Astra has a $343.40M market cap, which shows that most of the value of the company is just that $200M pile of cash. Once that cash is gone, so is their market cap and their ability to raise more capital.

In their earnings call yesterday, Astra also said that Rocket 3 was not a commercially viable product, and even if it did work reliably, there were simply not enough interested customers for it to be successful. Apparently satellites are growing in size and customers want larger rockets like Terran R, as evidenced by Relativity Space‚Äôs ridiculous [$1.2B backlog](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/30/relativity-space-inks-deal-with-oneweb-reaches-1-2b-in-terran-r-launch-contracts/).

I wonder what this means for Rocket Lab and the future of Electron? In my opinion, it looks like Electron might be the only smallsat launcher left standing. There is little incentive for anyone else to develop a competitor for Electron since it seems that rockets of this size are not commercially viable. But there is a silver lining. Rocket Lab is at least able to mostly break even on their Electron launches. This gives them an extremely cost effective R&D testbed to develop the technology they need for Neutron. Electron also gives Rocket Lab publicity and helps them to build up launch heritage and relationships with customers.

Did Rocket Lab take inspiration from Pioneer 13 for it's Venus Mission?,"Pioneer 13, also known as Pioneer Venus 2, was a mission carried out by NASA as part of their Pioneer Program which involved sending a range of probes to various objects within the solar system. The design chosen by Rocket Lab has quite a few distinct similarities' to the Pioneer Venus 2 but also a couple noticeable differences. One of the similarities is the design of the probe capsule, which is almost identical in shape. The shape of the spacecraft are also fairly similar with the noticeable difference being that Rocket Lab's design places the solar panels on top of the craft, not the sides. Curious to know what other people think about this.

Electron's 27th launch from New Zealand.
==========
Stage 1&2 success. 
==========
Quick Facts:

**Lift-off is scheduled for 0955 UTC from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 Pad B.**

Rocket Lab is launching: 
""Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment, also known as CAPSTONE.""


This pathfinding 55-pound CubeSat, will be the first spacecraft to test the Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) around
the Moon.

Researchers expect this orbit to be a gravitational
sweet spot in space ‚Äì where the pull of gravity from
Earth and the Moon interact to allow for a nearly stable orbit.

The orbit will bring CAPSTONE within 1,000 miles
of one lunar pole on its near pass and 43,500
miles from the other pole at its peak every seven
days, requiring less propulsion capability for
spacecraft flying to and from the Moon‚Äôs surface
than other circular orbits.

CAPSTONE is expected to orbit this area around
the Moon for at least six months to understand the
characteristics of the orbit. The NRHO
provides the advantage of an unobstructed view of
Earth in addition to coverage of the lunar South Pole.
