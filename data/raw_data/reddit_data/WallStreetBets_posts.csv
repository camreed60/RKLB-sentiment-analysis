Sold for a profit of 50k!,"Last week I put my entire port when it was at $8.05... then it begin to drop and was down over $30k by the end of the week.

Woke up today and saw it was up over $2.50 and took my chance to sell.

First I did this with rocket labs (27k), then archer (13k), then rigetti (20k), then soundhound (15k) and now this (50k). 

I tell myself to stop betting my entire port on one stock and this is the last time... but I'll surely find something equally idiotic in a few days and do it all over again.",204,51,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hfokpx
"Overvalued Companies (PLTR, SHOP, CRWD)","The market right now is filled with young companies reaching impressive highs and earning steep valuations. Each has its own story, and for investors, the challenge is finding the next Mag 7 or something close to it. 

I’m curious to hear your thoughts on which of these companies might have what it takes to rise to the top and why. Some examples I’m considering are PLTR, SHOP, CRWD, APP, RKLB, and a few others. I wasn’t around during the early days of Amazon, Apple, and similar companies, but I imagine they also went through cycles of intense enthusiasm, stock price spikes, and corrections. Could we be seeing something similar play out with these names?",27,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hbkfmv/overvalued_companies_pltr_shop_crwd/
