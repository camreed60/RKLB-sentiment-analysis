We have gotten lenient and allowed some posts where OP will just say "" I have \_\_\_\_ shares and \_\_\_ calls/puts"" but lets be real.... it is almost 2025. If you have the time to write up a DD post and cant bother to just include a screenshot of your positions, why should anyone bother listening to you.

All in on LUNR (redux),"Hello everyone. I'm back in LUNR, and once again feeling supremely confident. Some of you followed my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fzvgfc/all_in_on_lunr/) where I disclosed my exit around $750k, cashing out incrementally between $13 - $14. The stock spent the past couple weeks consolidating and continuously testing $11.60. I felt good rebuilding my position at this price, anticipating a rally between now and IM2 on February 27.  

There was another tidbit that some of you may have picked up on and, if you read it like I did, felt good about. On Dec 3 LUNR announced a public offering to raise up to $85M. The market reacted negatively to this news, likely because investors were caught off guard. Not long prior, the company retracted its mixed shelf offering and on the most recent earnings call reiterated sufficent cash on hand to operate through 2025. So why the cap raise? Steve Altemus commented that any forthcoming cap raise would likely be ""opportunistic"" in nature. Maybe they raised the cash simply because they could. My bet is that we're going to see a new contract entering the mix and they need the working capital to execute. In any case, said bonus notwithstanding, my gut PT is $20 by March 1.

WSJ: ‚ÄúYoung Wall Street bankers say they have a drug problem with ADHD pills‚Äù,"
ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°

Many Wall Street bankers use Adderall and Vyvanse as tools to plow through long hours of tedious work amid high-pressure competition.

[https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/young-banker-finance-adhd-medication-adderall-d578a16f](https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/young-banker-finance-adhd-medication-adderall-d578a16f)

As Mark Moran was facing another 90-hour week as an investment-banking intern at Credit Suisse in New York, he knew he needed help to survive the rest of the summer. His colleagues gave him a tip: Visit a Wall Street health clinic and tell the staff he had trouble focusing.

Ahead of his first appointment, he filled out a five-minute questionnaire. One of the questions asked if he had trouble staying organized, another, if he procrastinated. He then met with a clinician who said his answers suggested he had attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. He left with a prescription for Adderall.

No matter that a family member, a psychologist, didn‚Äôt think Moran had ADHD. He found that when he took Adderall, he could keep working for hours, and was able to actually be interested in some of the mundane tasks required of a young investment banker, such as aligning corporate logos on a PowerPoint or formatting cells in Microsoft Excel. 

He also wanted to show his bosses he was a hard worker and eventually secure a lucrative full-time job offer after finishing graduate school.

‚ÄúThey gave me a script, and within months, I was hooked,‚Äù said Moran, now 33 years old and running his own investor-relations firm. He‚Äôs also a provocative personality on social media, commenting on finance, politics and culture, including prescription drug use. ‚ÄúYou become dependent on it to work.‚Äù

Images of Wall Street‚Äôs rank-and-file blowing cash on illegal drugs and nightlife are well known, with cocaine a favored drug through the 1980s, as portrayed in ‚ÄúThe Wolf of Wall Street.‚Äù 

These days, drugs are more a tool to optimize performance on the job. Especially for entry-level bankers at the analyst and associate level‚Äîwho work long, tedious hours and fiercely compete for higher-level jobs with big pay days‚Äîprescriptions for stimulants such as Adderall and other ADHD drugs have become commonplace.  

Jonah Frey, who worked as an investment banker in healthcare for Wells Fargo in San Francisco, said one colleague would sometimes snort lines of crushed up Adderall pills from his desk in the bullpen‚Äîthe common area where junior bankers sit and work together. ‚ÄúNobody blinked an eye,‚Äù he said.

Others use nicotine pouches such as Zyn to excess, or consume energy drinks. One banker who worked in Houston between 2017 and 2019 described his colleagues drinking ‚ÄúMonsterbombs‚Äù‚Äîan extra-strength 5-hour Energy shot dropped into a glass filled with Monster Energy, chugged in one go. The caffeine payload was the equivalent of nearly five cups of coffee at once.

The feeling that the jobs can‚Äôt be done without stimulants comes as Wall Street is under fire for pushing junior bankers to take on dangerous workloads.

TLT: The Bond Bet That Might Just Make You Rich When Everyone Else Is Crying,"An under appreciated play that could be sitting on the mother of all rallies in the event of a recession: TLT, the 20+ year Treasury Bond ETF. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs being wrongly overlooked and why it could explode to $130 or more.

1. The Macro Setup: Recession Risk Is Real
Let‚Äôs face it ‚Äî has the economy been good to you and the people you know lately? Do the businesses in your area seem busy? is the economy really strong enough to support current valuations? If it is then why is the Fed cutting? People are saying those cuts are a mistake but are they or does the Fed see something we don‚Äôt? These cuts after all are eerily similar to the cuts leading up to 2008 with jobless claims currently trending up and holiday sales unlikely to beat well enough to save any jobs come January. Beyond that the 10yr-2yr spread is uninverted and so is the 10y-3mo spread both of which have never uninverted without a recession following closely after. All these factors scream that a recession is a real possibility in the near future. What happens when recession fears hit? Treasuries tend to rally as investors flock to safety.

2. TLT Is a Perfect Hedge
TLT is designed to track long-duration U.S. Treasury bonds, which are highly sensitive to yield movements. When investors start fleeing to safety in the face of recession, bond prices go up. If the Fed starts quantitative easing in response to economic slowdowns (which is likely), long-duration bonds like those tracked by TLT can see huge price increases because bond prices rise when yields fall.

3. So why is TLT down
The recent upward movement on yields at the long end of the curve reflects increasing supply in treasury bonds due to government issuance and inflationary fears stemming from tariffs and expectations related to the election driving down demand, but are inflationary fears really justified? Are we likely to see tariffs in full effect if the world economy slows? Are prices really likely to rise in the face of jobless-ness and tightening wages? European economies are already spiraling down and how long until we feel some impact? Yes, rates may stay elevated in the near term, as inflation reads fluctuate but the market is forward-looking and if it becomes clear that the Fed may be correct in their confidence that inflation is coming down what happens when the sentiment shifts? The demand for higher yielding long duration bonds comes roaring back. There was a bear steeping in the yield curve leading up to 2008 and long dated bond yields fell all the same once the economic cracks became clear. 
If this plays out once again in a rhyme to the GFC we could see a dovish pivot by the Fed as conditions worsen (and they probably will). Those overlooking TLT are underestimating the impact a recession will have on long-duration bonds.

4. Upside Potential in a Recession Scenario
If we see a recession with a corresponding dovish Fed pivot, TLT could easily see a 30-40% rally over the next 12 months with Jan 2027 $95 calls seeing 100%+ upside at just $110. Here's why:

* Fed could be forced to drive long-term bond yields lower via QE to stimulate the economy, which means TLT‚Äôs underlying bonds will increase in value.
* Flight to safety during recession, fears would bring back demand for government debt from this euphoric environment.
* Historically, long-duration bonds like those in TLT can see huge rallies in economic down turns ‚Äî think 2008 or 2020 when TLT surged.

5. TLT Is Undervalued Relative to Risks
Despite all the macro uncertainty, TLT remains an overlooked opportunity for significant upside. While people are obsessed with chasing tech stocks or betting on crypto, TLT is quietly setting up for a massive move in case the economy turns south. The amount of greed and euphoria we‚Äôre seeing right now can turn into a proportional amount of fear once sentiment shifts.

6. Risk Management
TLT isn‚Äôt just a recession hedge ‚Äî it‚Äôs also a portfolio stabilizer. As we saw during past economic crises, it can add balance and protection when equities are in turmoil. Even if you're playing high-beta stocks or options, TLT provides portfolio diversification and risk reduction.

TL;DR
TLT is being overlooked because the market is fully risk-on at the moment. But when the music stops, yields fall and recession fears intensify, TLT could easily rally 30% or more while economic contraction forces inflation further down. It‚Äôs the perfect hedge against economic downturns, and the current narrative is brushing it under the rug.

$AMD Bottoms Within the Next $10,"Intro:  
Many of you are probably pretty tired of $AMD. The last 8 or so months of downtrend is pretty deterring, especially while $NVDA continues to tear upwards. You're also probably tired of seeing hopium posts in the midst of tons of bear posts. I think most agree that fundamentally $AMD is a great company that should not be negative YTD. For those of you that have been waiting a long time to see it catch a bid off of the AI hype and necessity for chips, I think the wait is coming to an end. It's easy to point at the institutions and hedge funds and blame them for nuking the price, but hopefully with this thesis I can show that $AMD structurally is ready to reverse. To the untrained eye, the chart displayed should be easy to read, you can see the similarities between the two corrections quite easily. If any of you see any holes in this thesis please let me know. ""but institutional buying/selling,  unusual options, market dominance,"" Yea IDGAF about all that, just let me know if there are holes in the technical analysis.  If you don't want to read, I'll sum it up briefly:  AMD will bottom at $114-$121, followed by an HTF extension to $330.

Length of Corrections, Fibonacci Levels, Timing of Earnings & Structure:  
The first correction pictured lasted \~315 days, bottoming \~21 days from prior to earnings. The current correction is pacing to also finish within the golden pocket ($114-$122, where institutions have most interest in buying), matching the length of the previous correction and also \~21 days off of the next earnings. Earnings are marked in blue vertical lines on the chart. As you can see with our current correction, we are likely in the final wave of our ABCDE correction. There is a small chance we could skip the golden pocket and shoot for the 0.236 @ $96, but this is quite unlikely. The run up that followed the previous correction saw price top at $227, nearly touching our 1.618 extension at $232. If we see the same process unfold: A bounce and run up from the pocket, we could expect our 1.618 to be @ $333 per share, pictured in the top right.

MACD & RSI:  
Once again, If you just study the structure of the MACD underneath the two corrections, it is easy to see how close they are in form. I'm not going to attempt to explain each cross and describe what I am seeing in words, the charts speak for themselves for MACD. RSI during the previous correction saw a low highlighted in green at the bottom at 32. The previous two run ups both peaked at 82, and I would like to think it is highly likely RSI will bottom at 32 again, currently sitting at 39. This one it is also easy to see the similarities in structure on the chart. MACD and RSI showing the same structure as the last correction before a 300% run with a bottom going into earnings is possibly the most bullish copy and paste set up I have seen in a long time.

Conclusion:  
I don't wish to spread more lackluster hopium for this stock. I am trying to make the point that structurally, if it were to bottom and reverse, within the next month would be the most logical place for this to occur. Hopefully, those that have been burned holding this stock understand that it simply just needed time to cool off after that 300% run. Once markets find the price has been pushed low enough it should begin another, it's literally illustrated in the charts. I could be wrong. There could be more downside after the golden pocket, but this is a play I am willing to lose money on because it meets every checkmark presented from an analysis view. If it folds I cannot be upset because I stuck with the rules and didn't put money somewhere else that didn't look as structurally sound.

Stating the obvious on quantum,"The recent results from google should kill all other quantum stocks, not pump them. Google is on a possible track towards scalability and seems to be working a good project. Google's still very far away, if ever, from having a useful quantum computer, but at least they leading the field and pursuing the right platform. However, you have some other companies, worth billions now, that will never succeed because they are not even pursuing platforms that are reasonably scalable or error-correctable. How they allow themselves to be traded publicly in good conscience, I do not know ($).¬†

Here's an excerpt from a comment I wrote like a year ago to someone who was sharing headlines from a quantum startup that is pursuing the ion-trap platform. I was frustrated with the headline they shared because I found the companies headlines vs actual results to be very misleading, especially to layman investors that take their word as experts: ""It's not time for \[going public\]. They are selfishly too early. As evidenced by your original post where they just ""revealed"" in their quarterly blog (where they are supposed to be showing off advancements) that they only repeated what a team at Harvard did. If you noticed, they didn't even publish the fidelity of the ion/photon entanglement, which means it's probably not greater than the 80% reported by harvard. It's not close to the 99.9999+% needed to work. The somewhat misleadingly put a 99.6% two-qubit gate fidelity on that blog page, which isn't from the same experiment.‚Äù

Quantum computing is very far away. Anyone who is trying to make money off selling you a quantum computer or the promise of a quantum computer at this stage in the game should¬† be met with a lot of skepticism despite how credible they appear. From what I can tell, Google has the most reasonable progress but are quite clear about their timeline and I believe they (+microsoft, amazon) are the only ones who have the talent and money for a serious chance at success. Most of the other companies will fail and they know it, and there are enough people in the field that also know so I am sure that large investors know too. The only people who will be hurt by this rug pull will be small investors.

My advice is this:  I suggest to avoid the quantum stocks, you‚Äôre too late on making a short-term win, but consider shorting them. If there is going to be a quantum winner, it will anyways be the big tech companies. ",27,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hfcvbt/stating_the_obvious_on_quantum/
Tesla Bull and Bear case: the great AI and liability gamble,"Tesla stock has seen a meteoric rise recently, nearly doubling to $1.4T market cap in just three months. The catalyst is Trump‚Äôs victory and Elon Musk‚Äôs instrumental role in it. Investors expect Elon‚Äôs influence to relax regulations, clearing the way for a robotaxi rollout‚Äîa potential game-changer for the automotive industry and transportation infrastructure as a whole.

Tesla is trading like an AI startup, and for good reason: its ‚ÄúFull Self-Driving‚Äù (FSD) system is at the heart of the valuation. But investors are making several assumptions that warrant a closer look.  


# The Bull Case: Tesla‚Äôs data volume

Tesla has a massive data advantage. With over 4 million vehicles on the road, each equipped with a suite of cameras, Tesla‚Äôs fleet constantly collects real-world driving data. This data acts as a ‚Äúshadow trainer‚Äù for its AI, gathering insights in every imaginable driving condition. Meanwhile, FSD subscribers are essentially paying to supervise the AI, providing Tesla with even more labeled data.

Behind the scenes, Tesla employs an army of data labelers to prioritize edge cases‚Äîrare and tricky driving scenarios. Tesla combines supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning to continuously refine its AI. More importantly, Tesla‚Äôs massive data funnel gives it a clear edge in data volume, which usually means better machine learning.On top of this, Tesla‚Äôs vision-only approach‚Äîusing cameras without lidar‚Äîmakes its system cheaper and theoretically more scalable. The result? A system that could be deployed anywhere in the world, not just pre-mapped areas.





# The Bear Case: Quantity vs. Quality

More data is not always better, and it‚Äôs possible that Tesla might reach a plateau. Teslas are mostly driven in suburban and highway environments, where edge cases are relatively rare, while Waymo trains their AI in dense, chaotic urban areas.¬† The result is a more diverse dataset that‚Äôs constantly evolving.

Waymo is owned by Alphabet (Google‚Äôs parent company) and has been operating fully autonomous L4 robotaxis in large cities since 2018. It uses both cameras and lidar.¬† Combining 2D and 3D data in this way is something Tesla initially set out, but failed, to do.¬† Elon has said that the lidar data was hard to make sense of, since it often conflicted with the vision data.¬† But Waymo has somehow managed to make it work.¬† This means that its data is much richer in quality.¬† The urban-focused fleet also encounters far more edge cases than Tesla‚Äôs suburban-heavy dataset, giving its AI a potentially richer training environment.

The geofencing that Tesla bulls dismiss as a crutch is actually a strategic advantage for Waymo. By limiting its operations to pre-mapped areas, Waymo minimizes liability and achieves Level 4 autonomy with real-world deployments today. Tesla, by comparison, is still at Level 2, which means drivers must supervise and be ready to intervene. Moving from L2 to L4 isn‚Äôt just an incremental step‚Äîit‚Äôs an order-of-magnitude leap in complexity.

Tesla bulls overlook the difference between urban vs. suburban environments. Waymo trains its AI in the most chaotic environments‚Äîplaces like San Francisco and New York City. Tesla‚Äôs FSD, by contrast, collects much of its data in relatively predictable suburban and highway conditions. Cities provide more edge cases, such as jaywalking pedestrians, aggressive lane merges, and unexpected construction detours.

As the saying goes, ‚ÄúIf you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.‚Äù If Waymo‚Äôs AI can survive the chaos of Manhattan or downtown LA, it‚Äôs far more likely to handle less complex environments like suburbs or rural highways. In contrast, Tesla‚Äôs suburban data might create a ‚Äúsame-shit-different-day‚Äù scenario, where the AI becomes great at average cases but struggles with rare, high-stakes scenarios.

# Regulatory relaxation is a double-edged sword

If Musk succeeds in relaxing regulations, Tesla might clear the path for robotaxi deployment. In theory, this could limit Tesla‚Äôs liability, especially if passengers are required to sign release forms. However, accidents involving unsuspecting third parties (e.g., pedestrians) remain a significant risk. Under current frameworks, manufacturers are liable for autonomous vehicles, meaning Tesla could face infinite exposure, even for a small number of accidents.¬† Even if Musk changes the regulatory framework, courts ultimately determine liability, and his involvement could be seen as a conflict of interest at best, complicity at worst.

Tesla‚Äôs data suggests FSD already outperforms human drivers in safety metrics‚Äîwhich is very impressive. However, publishing accident rates also acknowledges that FSD causes accidents. They currently get away with it because, again, L2 puts the onus on the driver.  But it's a different story if they deploy robotaxis as L3 or L4. In that case, any accident caused by FSD is the onus of Tesla, exposing them to unlimited liability.

# The scalability myth

Tesla bulls often criticize Waymo‚Äôs reliance on lidar as costly and unscalable, but this argument doesn‚Äôt hold weight for two reasons.¬† First, lidar is becoming much cheaper, and with volume production, costs could approach Tesla‚Äôs camera-only system.¬† Ironically, Elon‚Äôs first principles philosophy should be applied here: just because something was a certain way before doesn‚Äôt mean it has to be that way.¬† Secondly, the market for taxis in general is urban.¬† When was the last time you saw one in a random suburb or the countryside?¬† Waymo only needs a few major cities to succeed, giving it a more focused path to profitability.



# Tesla vs. Waymo is really Tesla vs. Google

Waymo uses millions of AI-generated simulations to train its system. It‚Äôs AI teaching AI, similar to how AlphaGo and AlphaZero were trained. Tesla may also use simulations, but Waymo‚Äôs superior compute power (via Google‚Äôs custom TPUs) means it‚Äôs clearly dominant in this regard.

Tesla bulls often cite Elon‚Äôs dismissal of lidar and geofencing as evidence of Tesla‚Äôs superior approach. But they overlook Google‚Äôs hegemony in AI.¬† They were in the game before anyone.¬† They delivered AlphaGo, AlphaFold, and many other paradigm-shifting, world-changing products, backed by custom hardware and massive compute resources. Tesla‚Äôs Dojo may be promising, but it‚Äôs still a newbie.  
  


# tl;dr

Tesla‚Äôs $1.4T valuation rests on its perceived lead in autonomous driving, which is to say its lead in AI.¬† If Tesla dominates AI, the stock might still be undervalued. But the data quantity vs. data quality, liability risks, and Waymo‚Äôs technical advantages suggest Tesla may be actually falling behind.  In which case, it's vastly overvalued.

How should I pick LEAP to maximize returns (Strike & Greeks) for AMD,"Hypothetically, if I think a stock like AMD could go up in the next year and I intend on buying an 18 months out LEAP with the intention on re-selling it after the stock price goes up without suffering too much from theta decay. What strike price will it give me the highest % return? Should I go for ITM, ATM or OTM. I understand OTM is the cheapest option to go for and perhaps will give me the highest return if it later becomes ITM. Take AMD June 2026 for example, I see the theta decay being higher for some of the OTM options compared to ATM. I also noticed a higher delta and gamma for ATM options vs OTM. As for IV, the option chain demonstrates a volatility smile. Does this mean the ATM option is the cheapest option while demonstrating a higher % change for stock upsides or downsides? From a pure return perspective, does ITM options do well? I know ITM options are great for risk management or yield strategies such as a synthetic covered call.

2025 moving forward,"During 2023 correction I went heavy in tech. Bought so many names at an amazing prices also loaded on VTI/VTSAX. 
But admittedly, I missed the last boom. Was worried that election might turn differently and market will crash so have been setting with large amount of funds on MM. still hold almost all my mega caps except appl and TSLA now (Ik , crying every day)
The problem now, I can justify buying anything at these level. Everything I look at have PE above 100. I do weekly and monthly contributions to my accounts. Have been buying and selling calls here and there and account have been rising slowly due to my ETF.

We can corner the Nasdaq 100,"We need to start a SaaS company that buys TQQQ and then issues convertible bonds, which are attractive due to the high implied volatility of TQQQ, and uses the proceeds to buy more TQQQ. This company will naturally be added to the Nasdaq 100. Then our company will grow in value as a result of this index addition, causing the Nasdaq 100 to also rise somewhat, and the value of TQQQ to rise, and hence our stock to rise as well, since we own TQQQ. When it reaches critical mass, the stock will explode upwards, as it buys TQQQ and TQQQ buys QQQ and QQQ buys our stock, in an uncontrolled chain reaction, until it becomes all of the Nasdaq 100. Then our company will own all of the QQQ and we will have cornered the QQQ market.",1120,138,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1heelcy/we_can_corner_the_nasdaq_100/

Boomer Uncle in Law ,"So I met this uncle in law who is like 60 this summer for the first time and wasted no time to tell me how great of a trader he is and that he manages other peoples money which is fucking scary. He proceeded to tell me to buy ALT and CLF both are way lower than in when he told me to buy. Ever since then he keeps texting me and all he wants me to buy is XOM and NUE which he took a huge loss on both. Meanwhile I told him to buy Tesla at 220 , Meta at 540 , MSTR at 160. What is wrong with these boomers who keep calling for a crash every day ",6,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hf9vxt/boomer_uncle_in_law/
"Saw Opportunity, first time option plays","For all junkies that love chasing that feeling of being right. Its a hit of I FUCKING told you so. This story is for you‚Ä¶

I was noticing the Ai sector was picking up real good steam back in October with new highs, names getting hyped again, so I did some digging and started watching charts unfold. Started to see a pattern of things peaking 4x the price it was about 6/7 weeks priors and retreating. Rotating companies. Thats when I knew I had to play out some options.

Myself, have always invested in companies and view em as long term positions to hold. But a couple times I speculate on companies and my mistakes Ive made in past is getting in early and see my positions peak and just leave me in absolute dog shit below my entry point a season later. Why?! Wtf. I thought I did good. Turns out, there was a storm of events that drove the companies price up from , hype, short minded,‚Ä¶ you know purely speculation and the üí∞moves on to the next new idea but option calls and puts making out the most like a wild west bandit. 

Its Nov. 20th and there was some news dropped about Soundhound was going to make a demo at Jan. 7th for devices being able to connect with bluetooth or wifi. Whoa. Thats fucking cool. I get in. Heres my breakdown:

-100 contracts purchased 4-17-25 $7 (in the money) margin Call options, premium of $2.36 
-sold 10 contracts Dec. 5th for $6.50 ( gotta recoup that money ASAP) 
-fun fact-Dec 6th, Bitcoin hits all time highs.
-Dec 9th , things get blown out.. new high at $9! Yes sell 5 more contracts please. 
- from 10th to 12th , shit got rocky like it did the week after I got in. 
- Dec 13th. My price goal is met. Time to exit. 
- all contracts sold for $10. (3x return) 


Now, why am I selling before what seems like an absolute üöÄüöÄüöÄ going in such a beautiful uptrend is because my goal came early and had to secure my money. You gotta do your own research on companies and never go against your gut feeling. It‚Äôs why we have em.

To all out there still riding this bad boy out. Salute to you.

A minute of silence for the naked calls seller who closed right before $MSTR plummeted ,"He documented his whole journey and lost about $750K selling naked calls to regards 100% coming from this sub. 

He sold them all the way up from $200 to $500 and I swear he closed 1 hour before the citron research short paper that tanked the stock. 

Whatever you think about anything in this world kids, don‚Äôt sell naked calls please. 

Dont even sell CC‚Äôs if the market is bullish, I would even recommend to not sell them at all ! 

You‚Äôll make pennies instead of becoming a wealthy and sexy regard. 

I‚Äôm sure mods will destroy my round butthole for posting this but I thought it was important to aknowledge the fallen ones

Holding on to cash waiting to buy at a lower price? Sell a put!,"I always laugh at people saying they'd by at a lower price point and hold on to their cash always sitting on the sidelines never making any cash. 

If you have a specific price point you want to buy a stock at, just sell a naked put. 

Why? 

Not only do you get in at a lower price point if a stock does get the low, you also get free money from the premium!

Perhaps too many of you are too regarded to understand this so here's an example.

GOOG is currently trading at 191.40

Perhaps you're thinking youd totally buy in at 180 but not at the current price. 

Well what you can do is sell a $180 put that expired in two weeks. This option has a premium of $45. 

If the stock stays above that price, you collect $45. If it dips below, you get assigned and have to buy 100 shares at $180 which is the price you wanted to buy it anyways, and you get to keep the premium of $45!",635,184,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1he7g4c/holding_on_to_cash_waiting_to_buy_at_a_lower/
