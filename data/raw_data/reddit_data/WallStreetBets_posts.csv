Sold for a profit of 50k!,"Last week I put my entire port when it was at $8.05... then it begin to drop and was down over $30k by the end of the week.

Woke up today and saw it was up over $2.50 and took my chance to sell.

First I did this with rocket labs (27k), then archer (13k), then rigetti (20k), then soundhound (15k) and now this (50k). 

I tell myself to stop betting my entire port on one stock and this is the last time... but I'll surely find something equally idiotic in a few days and do it all over again.",210,53,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hfokpx

Concerns about RKLB and similar space stocks,"We all know RKLB has had a monstrous year and for good reason, their fundamentals are solid and have lots of room to grow.

My concern is with the amount of satellites up right now (around 11,000 as of June). Most of them are actively functioning and in low earth orbit.

Over time, as they get deactivated they'll just sit there waiting to collide with each other creating lots of space junk hindering future satellite deployment. There's no way to get them down and no way to clean up the junk when they do crash.

At the rate they're launching now (2.6k /year),  how long until it's no longer possible/feasible to launch any more? Will it even be in our lifetime?


Wanna go long on RKLB but this possibility makes me really hesitant.

"Fired my old fart financial advisor, stopped swing trading, started taking profits, started buying the dip (almost no options)","I‚Äôm no expert by any means, I‚Äôve just been listening to investors with a great track record on X, followed a few trends here like RKLB, and made a few large picks in $IONQ (sold 90% a few weeks ago), $HOOD, $HIMS, $RDDT, etc - companies with incredible futures ahead of them that have been proven.  This run is crazy, and I can sleep at night knowing I won‚Äôt nuke my entire port with a bad week of options.

$PL - Earth Data to Become Increasingly Valuable Under Trump Administration,"Alright, cat has gotten out of the bag while I have been writing this and Planet Labs is no longer a secret. This analysis is not written by ChatGPT, hopefully not nauseatingly sales-y, and has no regarded emojis or over the top use of ‚ÄúTo the Moon‚Äù. No frills, just my take on where I think there is deep value.

**Overview:**  
Earth observation data as a business has long struggled to be profitable. It requires significant CAPEX, is high risk (strapping a cam to a rocket essentially), and the R+D on a lot of the imaging can be pretty exorbitant. The main leader in the space, Planet Labs, went public in the SPAC boom. As a whole, they‚Äôve underperformed the promises they presented in their first prospectus. Planet Labs sought to be a ""One to Many"" data provider, and their main selling point was that earth data could be widely commercialized. While this is still fundamentally true, in the time since going public they have essentially become a government contractor (75% revenue from some form of government with only a quarter from general business use) (source: Q2 Investor Presentation). Revenue being sourced primarily from the government is two sides of the same coin and the value lies in the eye of the beholder: it's bad because they are too reliant on too few customers, or that government revenue is extremely sticky and a major growth driver under the right administration. I am of the latter opinion.

I think we are at an inflection point that could cause Planet Labs to become far more profitable than they are currently, which will cause their valuation to adjust higher (far higher than even their recent run-up). While the use cases for the their data is very broad, it has become evident in the last few years that the most profitable one is government use.

**My thesis lies in the following:**

1. Donny and a Republican majority House/Senate will have a much larger Defense and Intelligence budget. They will be willing to pay a premium to obtain top tier defense and intelligence data from vendors like $PL.
2. NATO contract is highly promising (https://spacenews.com/planet-signs-deal-with-nato-to-supply-satellite-imagery/) and is a first of its kind deal. Follow-on mandates to come if $PL executes.
3. Launch of Tanager-1 (a first of its kind methane specific tracking satellite - highly valuable for int'l governments seeking to gather data on parties with the most harmful emissions) and subsequent release of data should bolster top-line (new sales team will hopefully execute).

Also before you ask, why can‚Äôt RKLB, SpaceX, etc. just strap cameras to their rockets? Or why can‚Äôt Starlink tack some cameras on their satellites? Boiled down most simply: they can‚Äôt do it efficiently or cost-effectively. They‚Äôd have to divert time and resources away from their primary businesses (which already have their own significant challenges) just to fight an uphill battle; this can be discussed more at length if clarity is needed but I just don‚Äôt see it as a likely scenario. Generally speaking this would more likely materialize as a continued symbiotic relationship (Planet Labs uses SpaceX rockets to launch their satellite constellations for example).

**Other thoughts:**  
Larger market cap compared to closest peer, no debt, invests more heavily in development of new technologies (I view this as a plus long term - they understand that earth images can be commoditized and are spending heavily to develop a suite of analytics products which can materially enhance user experience - this will create competitive advantage long-term; and yes before you ask, their data is being used to train AI models - see Laconic deal today - perfect example of their R+D spend beginning to pay off), recently trimmed workforce (leaner operating structure), largest and highest-quality satellite fleet (and it's not even close - actually a staggering difference), multiple partnerships with Google (Google owns \~12%), rumors are circling that they will finally announce positive adj EBITDA either this quarter or next (management has been targeting Q4)

**Position and Price Target**:  
I am planning to update this and positions continuously; I do believe in the growth of PL and will likely add on. May roll the 12/20‚Äôs, not decided yet.

Position:  
12/20/2025 $5C 9x  
4/17/2025 $5C 4x

Target: $PL 5/1/2025: $10/share

**TLDR:**  
Earth data used for defense and intelligence will become significantly more valuable over the next year due to major administrative tailwinds. Donny's Department of Defense will award more government contracts at a higher value, which will finally let them scale in the way they were meant to (R+D, Capex, and cash burn from last few years will all be justified by a stronger top-line). The mature business model for $PL is essentially a software company with high gross margins. The margin expansion will finally be realized as more contracts are awarded and valuations will correct accordingly. Additionally, while they do seek to serve a wide array of industries (i.e. agriculture, natural resources, etc.) the biggest short term tailwinds (I think) will be defense and intelligence contracts.

Also - it is impossible to have covered all the bases in this, so shoot your questions below and let's discuss. Happy to try and answer/clarify any of the above points. Lastly, I am a complete regard lol I could be wrong; not financial advice.",443,179,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h59vbt/pl_earth_data_to_become_increasingly_valuable/

Bigbear.ai is primed and ready for take-off,"# TL;DR:

BigBear.ai is flying under the radar but has massive potential. This is your chance to grab a future AI juggernaut while it's still cheap. There is a perfect storm of catalysts brewing (government contracts, strategic market positioning, and booming AI demand) - think Palantir but still in its early innings.

**What is it?**

Bigbear is an AI-powered decision-making and analytics platform with a strong focus on government contracts, particularly with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and intelligence agencies. Their software helps organizations predict, visualize, and act on complex data to drive better outcomes.

**Why has it been overlooked?**

1. Tiny market cap of around $550m.
2. Low institutional ownership of less than 10% - mostly VC and Retail (although this has been growing over the last few months).
3. Went public via SPAC so the share price dropped massively initially.

**What it has going for it**

1. Secured a 5-year $165m USD contract from the US Army in October - clearly working closely with government agencies.
2. 2024 Q3 22.1% revenue increase to $41.5m and an improved gross margin of 25.9%, despite a net loss of $12.2m.
3. It's cheap af - expecting FY24 revenue of up to $180m at just $550m market cap. Granted it is loss-making currently but so is RKLB, ACHR, etc..
4. Rated as a Strong Buy from Wall Street analysts.
5. Has diverse revenue streams in healthcare and warehousing, increasing addressable market (already have contracts with Amazon).
6. $437m¬†backlog as of latest earning call.
7. Acquired Pangiam in 2023, a leader in facial recognition tech (CEO was former Director of Homeland Security).
8. The share price has been steadily rising over the past few months, but has yet to explode.

**Catalysts going forward**

Here we get a bit theoretical but I believe there is huge upside here for a few reasons:

1. Trump in office - more spending on defence and domestic security budgets (facial recognition is great for finding illegal immigrants hmmm).
2. It comes across as massively undervalued given it's current revenue and growth potential - trading at just over 3x forward revenue vs Palantir at 45x forward revenue.
3. Institutional ownership is rising fast - smart money is catching on for good reason.
4. Trend-wise, this stock fits the profile of something that will absolutely skyrocket on any positive news. AI deeptech, DoD contracts, growing revenue, and hugely overlooked.
5. It currently has 80 open positions on linkedin and with around 500 employees, this suggests they are investing hard for growth.

Basically, this is your chance to get in early on the next PLTR.

Hasn‚Äôt the recent relationship between Leon and the next POTUS strengthened the bear case against ASTS and RKLB?,"Open to any thoughts or ideas‚Äîthere‚Äôs a lot I don‚Äôt know about these two companies, and I don‚Äôt have much money to invest, but I do enjoy following the markets. 

Won‚Äôt SpaceX be the go-to for both of these sectors, launch services and cellular communications? It‚Äôs difficult to imagine the US wanting to branch out very much from a known quantity, now that the next POTUS has been chosen and he arrives with a prepackaged Leon. 

Another way to ask the same question: Now that SpaceX has powerful support from the White House (I assume), what can ASTS or RKLB provide that SpaceX can‚Äôt, or can‚Äôt develop?

3k>84k +2200%,"Back in August I managed to swing trade a couple thousand to 18k by playing AMD earnings and Palantir back in August. I was greedy and thought I couldn‚Äôt lose. I ended up yoloing 90% of my portfolio into HIMS and got absolutely reemed and that 18k vaporized into 3k.

I was depressed, defeated, pissed. But most importantly this was a wake up call. No longer was I going to Yolo or invest in companies I didn‚Äôt believe in. I spent the next couple hours researching stocks on WSB and Stocktwits and discovered RKLB which was trading at around 4.00 at the time.

I yolo‚Äôd my remaining 3k into 7.00 calls expiring in January 2025. The rest is history.

I have learned from a lot of regards here about squandering life changing money (in particular the guy who went from 1k to 1 mill and soon to 0).

Options was just a mean to come up quick. I am now investing in only shares from now on and I am all in 3k Rocketlab and 1k of ACHR shares.",1752,185,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h36s5v
