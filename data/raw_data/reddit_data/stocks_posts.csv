"Overvalued Companies (PLTR, SHOP, CRWD)","
The market right now is filled with young companies reaching impressive highs and earning steep valuations. Each has its own story, and for investors, the challenge is finding the next Mag 7 or something close to it. 

Iâ€™m curious to hear your thoughts on which of these companies might have what it takes to rise to the top and why. Some examples Iâ€™m considering are PLTR, SHOP, CRWD, APP, RKLB, and a few others. I wasnâ€™t around during the early days of Amazon, Apple, and similar companies, but I imagine they also went through cycles of intense enthusiasm, stock price spikes, and corrections. Could we be seeing something similar play out with these names?",90,107,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hblmf3/overvalued_companies_pltr_shop_crwd/

How Long Will You Keep DCA?,"Let's say you are doing DCA for stocks you have high convictions, such as NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, PLTR or RKLB.

And you are doing, say $200 per month or perhaps $500 every quarter (more or less, depending on your financial situations) per stock.

1) At what stage of the stock's life would you then decide to stop DCA? Especially for stocks like MSFT and AAPL that have been around for a long while?

2) Also, while you DCA, would you also sell your initial amount you bought? Or you'd let it ride?

3) What stocks are you guys DCA now?

Thank you folks! ðŸš€

Name a large-cap stock and its small-cap competitor ,"I am always looking for small/mid-cap companies that have a similar business model or product as large cap competitors! 

Iâ€™ll start by naming a few (large-cap and small-cap) companies: 

- CRWD and S
- COST and BJ
- KR and SFM
- CMG and CAVA 
- MNST and CELH
- SBUX and BROS 
- Space X and RKLB (count it) 

I always love seeing the small caps slowly take a piece of the pie from the big boys. Itâ€™s what capitalism is all about. Especially fun to see when the little guy has a better product. I think this is the case for almost all of the companies I listed. If they arenâ€™t flat out better, they offer something slightly different, or are better in a certain way. 

These smaller cap stocks are obviously a bigger risk, since a lot of them still are not making money, but the growth is very appealing. 

Would love to hear some comparisons like this and an explanation as to why you think the smaller company is better, or will continue to grow. 

Appreciate any responses! The stock market is a wonderful place for some competition. 

Also, itâ€™s my cake-day!",182,110,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h62rcf/name_a_largecap_stock_and_its_smallcap_competitor/
