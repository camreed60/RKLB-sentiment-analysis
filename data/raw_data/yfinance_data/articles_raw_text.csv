https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-delivers-second-spacecraft-130000750.html,"LONG BEACH, Calif., December 17, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, has successfully delivered its second Pioneer spacecraft to Vandenberg Space Force Base and completed production and testing of a third for Varda Space Industries, Inc. (""Varda""), the world's first orbital pharmaceutical processing and hypersonic Earth re-entry logistics company. The two spacecraft are part of afour-vehicle contractbetween Rocket Lab and Varda, aimed at revolutionizing commercial manufacturing in space. Designed, built, and tested at Rocket Lab’s state-of-the-art Spacecraft Production Complex in Long Beach, California, thePioneer platformserves as the enabler of Varda’s innovative missions. Rocket Lab’s Pioneer platform hosts Varda’s reentry capsule, which leverages microgravity conditions to conduct operations in space that are difficult or impossible on Earth. Rocket Lab’s Pioneer spacecraft provides essential systems for power, communications, propulsion, and attitude control for Varda’s 120kg reentry capsule. To enable Varda’s operations and safely return the capsule to Earth, the Pioneer spacecraft maneuvers the capsule into the precise position and sets it on a course for reentry. Rocket Lab also provides critical mission operations support for launch, commissioning, operation and reentry of the spacecraft. The first Pioneer spacecraft Rocket Lab developed for Varda was launched in 2023 and spent eight months on orbit, successfully enabling the growth of crystals of the HIV/AIDS-treating drug ritonavir inside Varda’s capsule. The capsule was successfully deorbited and landed in the Utah desert in February 2024. For Varda’s second mission, scheduled for launch in Q1 of 2025, Rocket Lab and Varda will once again conduct in-space operations, reentry positioning maneuvers, but this time deorbit the spacecraft over Australia and land Varda’s capsule at the Koonibba Test Range in South Australia. Rocket Lab’s ability to complete production and testing of a third spacecraft for Varda less than two months aftercompletion of the secondis testament to the Company’s vertical integration strategy and recent scaling of satellite production capability. By vertically integrating design, component manufacturing, satellite integration and testing, Rocket Lab has optimized schedule and cost efficiency in satellite production. ""We’re setting a new standard for rapid, reliable satellite production,"" said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck. ""Each Pioneer spacecraft for Varda’s missions is a perfect demonstration of our growing capability as an end-to-end space company that delivers design, manufacturing, integration, testing, launch support and in-space operations to get our customers’ innovative ideas on orbit quickly and cost effectively."" ""This mission is another step toward high cadence reentry"" said Varda CEO and co-founder Will Bruey. ""Soon, reentry will be as common as launch.""

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-rocket-lab-usa-191326376.html,"Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Rocket Lab USA fair value estimate is US$28.81 Rocket Lab USA's US$23.01 share price signals that it might be 20% undervalued Analyst price target for RKLB is US$22.14which is 23% below our fair value estimate Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow. Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at theSimply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Rocket Lab USA We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$134.9m US$81.6m US$280.0m US$382.0m US$460.7m US$530.7m US$591.3m US$643.2m US$687.8m US$726.6m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x4 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 20.59% Est @ 15.20% Est @ 11.43% Est @ 8.78% Est @ 6.93% Est @ 5.64% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% -US$127 US$72.4 US$234 US$301 US$342 US$371 US$389 US$399 US$402 US$400 (""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)= US$2.8b The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%. Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2034× (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$727m× (1 + 2.6%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.6%) = US$21b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$21b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$12b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$14b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$23.0, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 20% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Rocket Lab USA as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.857. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. Strength Debt is well covered by earnings. Weakness Shareholders have been diluted in the past year. Opportunity Forecast to reduce losses next year. Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows. Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%. Threat Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow. Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on RKLB. Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (RKLB)'s share was trading at $27.28 as of Nov 29th. Pixabay/Public Domain Rocket Lab (RKLB) continues to cement its status as a leader in the burgeoning space industry, leveraging cutting-edge production capabilities and strategic partnerships to realize its vision of providing comprehensive space services. With its foundational technologies in rockets and spacecraft firmly established, the company is now focused on scaling operations to create its own constellations, offering highly sought-after services and capabilities.

This agreement positions Neutron as a pivotal player in the medium-lift launch market, a critical segment for national security and commercial needs. By carefully selecting its debut customers, Rocket Lab enhances the strategic potential of its launches, including the possibility of deploying entire constellations for this operator. The company’s ties to the U.S. government were further solidified through an $8 million Air Force contract, which underscores Neutron’s importance to the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. This collaboration not only advances Rocket Lab’s engineering capabilities, notably through its Archimedes engine development, but also ensures smoother integration into NSSL’s most critical missions, highlighting the dual benefits of defense partnerships. Rocket Lab’s Q3 2024 performance underscores its momentum, with revenue surging 55% year-over-year, primarily driven by its thriving space systems segment. The company’s spacecraft production line in Long Beach is operating at unprecedented speed, addressing a backlog exceeding 40 spacecraft and highlighting its capability to industrialize space systems production efficiently. Despite ongoing cash burn of $30–$50 million per quarter, this is expected to taper off once Neutron begins generating revenue, likely by late 2025 or early 2026. Financially, Rocket Lab’s outlook remains robust, with projected Q4 2024 revenue growth exceeding 100% year-over-year. Improved gross margins, rising from 22.1% in Q3 2023 to 26.7% in Q3 2024, further demonstrate the scalability of its operations. Under CEO Sir Peter Beck’s leadership, Rocket Lab’s culture of relentless innovation continues to be its most significant competitive advantage, enabling rapid iterations in design and production that drive cost efficiencies and reinforce its economic moat. As Rocket Lab evolves, its ability to execute on its strategic pillars—launching, building, and operating space constellations—places it in a prime position to capitalize on both commercial and national security opportunities, making it a compelling investment in the space sector.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-predictions-for-the-space-economy-in-2025-150052650.html,"2025 could prove to be one of the most transformative years on record for the space economy. Between Elon Musk’sclose ties with the incoming president, a new administration that is expected to be strongly pro-growth and anti-regulation, and the emergence of Starship, a rapidly reusable rocket that will shake up all the givens of accessing orbit, we are on the verge of significant changes that accelerate the growth of the space economy. There are pros and cons to these upcoming changes. On the one hand, a more pro-growth administration will reduce and simplify the abundance of federal and local regulations that hamper new launch and development efforts and increase the costs for businesses. It could also lead to even more privatization of US space operations and greater federal funding support for space companies developing dual-use technologies. On the other hand, strong deregulation could prioritize growth over environmental protections. It could also pose challenges to the Earth observation sector and other climate monitoring technology. Another key question is how muchmoredominant will SpaceX become in the next four years? The company is already the apex player in launch (the modern space economy wouldn’t even exist without the Falcon 9), so will its few competitors be innovative and strategic enough to keep up with the major growth that is coming? Musk’s close ties to the president-elect are only part of the equation here. The arrival of Starship will have a monumental impact on the space economy by accelerating growth in existing markets, enabling entirely new industries, and making existing infrastructure obsolete. As we look ahead, here are 10 predictions for the space capital markets in 2025. 1. The next four years Under the new administration, expect an even greater focus on promoting the space economy and on commercial space integration into government programs. Given Musk’s role in the administration and as one of the largest donors of the campaign, SpaceX will be the greatest beneficiary, but others will benefit as well, most notably from a light-touch regulatory regime for novel space activities overseen by the Commerce. 2. Starship comes online Starship will reach orbit and begin operational flights in the first half of 2025, carrying Starlink V2 satellites. With its rapidly accelerating test program reaching a nearly monthly launch cadence in 2024, Starship will double its flight rate in 2025, aided by less regulatory resistance from the FAA, which Musk will have influence over in his new role as the head ofthe Department of Government Efficiency,or DOGE. This vehicle will usher in the next phase of the space economy by significantly reducing the cost and complexity of payload missions; opening the door to crewed missions to the Moon and Mars, as well as lunar development; and setting the stage for emerging industries ranging from orbital habitats and manufacturing platforms to point-to-point travel and extended stay tourism in orbit and beyond. 3. Mars or bust Expect an acceleration of plans for a crewed landing on Mars using primarily SpaceX/Starship architecture, unlike the more complicated NASA-led architecture for Artemis. Support for Artemis will likely continue but will be accompanied by a major review and reconsideration of architecture. For example, a significant number of major programs, such as SLS, Orion, and ML2 are over budget, behind schedule, and/or otherwise troubled. However, any changes to SLS would likely cause domestic headaches, particularly at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., which supports 24,000 jobs and manages the SLS program. Additionally, the Gateway was designed to accommodate international collaboration in the Artemis program but with an America-first approach, and this approach could find less support. 4. More competition for SpaceX despite a direct line to the White House Although SpaceX holds a dominant position in launch and satellite internet, 2025 will see competition emerge from several key players. Amazon’s (AMZN) Project Kuiper will begin operations next year, which poses the single greatest threat to Starlink’s market dominance. Direct-to-device connectivity will come online in 2025, with Starlink V2 and Apple (AAPL) moving to improve space-based communications for iPhones with a $1.7 billion investment in GlobalStar and AST SpaceMobile delivering for telecom partners like AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ). Starlink will also see increased global competition from the Chinese G60/Thousand Sails constellation, which will see half of its first phase launched in 2025. New launch vehicles will also come online next year, including Rocket Lab’s (RKLB) Neutron and Blue Origin’s New Glenn. These will pose a direct challenge to the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, although Starship is poised to move the goalposts and supersede them. 5. Space Superiority Geopolitical strains continue to fuel an increase in US Defense spending, with benefits for the US Space Force (USSF), which will be accelerated under the new administration. We expect this to show up most clearly in Resilient Global Positioning Systems (R-GPS) and Alternative Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (AltPNT) as conflicts continue and China’s BeiDou continues to displace GPS in aligned countries. Through Starshield, the USSF will increasingly rely on SpaceX for national security missions across GPS, geospatial intelligence, satellite communications (SatCom), space domain awareness, in-space transportation, and more. The establishment of a Space National Guard is inevitable under the new administration and will further expand public-commercial alliances and technology integrations. 6. Incumbents adjust to the new world order In 2025, Boeing (BA) and Airbus (AIR.PA) will sell off their space businesses after failing to keep up with the pace of change. These divestitures by entrenched government contractors mark a pivotal moment in the space economy, as it changes the competitive landscape, establishes a new power broker system, and creates new opportunities and risks in the government’s extended capabilities in space. Meanwhile, expect an acceleration in SatCom M&A as leading incumbents — such as SES (SES) and Intelsat (combined in 2024), DirectTV and Dish (2024), Viasat and Inmarsat (2023), Eutelsat and OneWeb (2023) — push for greater consolidation to better compete with Starlink and other new non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) entrants. 7. Connecting the digital and physical worlds Over the next year, artificial intelligence will continue to transform capabilities across the space economy, but it will be most prevalent in “spatial intelligence” as it facilitates the integration of geospatial data into Big Tech. The successful integration of Mapbox with OpenAI’s ChatGPT search is just one early example of the possibilities evolving in this marketplace. World Labs, founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, has raised $230 million to develop spatially intelligent large world models (LWMs) that can understand and reason about the 3D world from images and other modalities. Companies are already in a race to automate systems that enable proliferated architecture, and AI is the only real solution to the bottleneck. Expect these efforts to accelerate dramatically in 2025, particularly due to stronger federal support for Big Tech and AI innovation as the next administration looks to increase its lead over China. 8. Coordination of orbital traffic goes from elective to essential While China has launched a lot of rockets to date, it still only comprises a small percentage of the total global mass to orbit. Expect that to change in 2025 as Chinese mega-constellations like G60, Geely, and more begin to launch in earnest. The exponential growth in satellites in orbit (currently faster than Moore’s Law) will force the conversation of coordination despite geopolitical tensions. Due to the US government’s restrictions on direct collaboration with China, these efforts will be led by private industry. This will create a new wave of privatization in space traffic coordination and there is a strong probability that the Commerce Department’s Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS) program will either be canceled or significantly restructured to emphasize commercial data. 9. Political climate Under the next administration, the US is about to make a sharp turn on climate policy, which will have negative impacts on certain environmental protections and new efforts by geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) companies to improve climate monitoring and solutions. The biggest risks for the GEOINT industry are a reduction in federal funding and specific programs, like NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) and NOAA’s Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) programs, as well as an overall challenge (and perhaps dismantling) of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) incentives for businesses and investors. At the same time, extreme weather events like heat waves, floods, and wildfires will become increasingly frequent, impacting more people and further straining insurance markets. Private capital will have to step up to continue to fund energy transition and climate projects, like MethaneSAT and FireSAT, in an effort to fill the gap left by cuts in climate change and civil Earth observation programs by the new administration. 10. Play stations Whoever buys Boeing’s International Space Station (ISS) operations business will continue their push for an extension of the ISS beyond 2030. Meanwhile, Vast will launch its Haven station in 2025, providing an exit option for a government program that is underfunded and unwanted. The current administration has already been rethinking its Commercial Low Earth Orbit Development Program (CLD), and that skepticism is likely to intensify in the next administration. The reality is that space stations are extremely costly and difficult to maintain, and Starship provides an effective alternative that checks a number of key boxes: It's less expensive, easier and faster to launch and become operational, and you can have multiple stations for less than the cost of one ISS today. Between the practicality of Starship and Musk’s influence in the White House, there is a strong possibility that space stations will become another SpaceX domain. While the last decade has seen remarkable progress in the space economy, the next four years will experience many dramatic changes — beginning with a rapid phaseout of incumbents and new political priorities in 2025. The space economy is poised for a surge in growth and development that will be fueled by deregulation and enhanced US defense spending, but the disruptive effects of Starship, as well as SpaceX’s growing influence over federal policy, will have far-reaching impacts across many space industries. Chad Anderson is the founder and managing partner of Space Capital, where he has been pioneering investment in the space economy for over a decade. He is an investor in SpaceX, along with dozens of other space companies, and is also theauthor of ""The Space Economy,"" published by Wiley. Between 2019 and 2022, Anderson regularly briefed the White House on startup activity and investment trends in the space economy. That intelligence has been cited by the vice president of the United States at the National Space Council and the Secretary of Commerce. He has an MBA from the University of Oxford.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-nasdaq-rklb-rally-215403139.html,"Over the past year, space technology provider Rocket Lab (RKLB) has skyrocketed beyond expectations, with shares soaring 357% to a market capitalization past $9.8 billion. As the sector sees continued enthusiasm and success for private launch capabilities, a thorough examination of what’s next for would-be investors is critical. I have long been bullish on Rocket Lab, but with the financials now making sense, unlike in previous years, I suspect the rally might just be getting started. Discover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place withAnalyst Top Stocks Make smarter investments withweekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter To me, the fundamentals paint a picture of growing strength, which is a reason why I am bullish. Rocket Lab maintained a robust 26.7%gross marginin Q3, suggesting strong pricing power and operational efficiency even as the company invests heavily in new initiatives. This can be an expensive time in the growth story of a company, but fortunately, some healthy margins signal maturing manufacturing processes and increasing economies of scale taking hold. As the frequency of launches from public and private space companies continues to increase, the latest earnings report reveals a business firing on all cylinders. Q3 revenue reached$104.81 million, a solid 55% jump from the previous year. More telling than the headline number is the firm’s successful evolution from a pure launch provider into a comprehensive space technology powerhouse. Space systems now generate the majority of revenue at $83.9 million, while launch services contributed $21 million in the quarter. This shift toward space systems could prove to be particularly significant for investors, as it demonstrates an ability to reduce its dependence on launch frequency, all while capturing higher-margin opportunities by developing specialized spacecraft and components. Potentially most compelling for me is the company’s substantial $442.39 million cash position, providing ample flexibility and resources to continue research and development, all while buffering against inevitable market uncertainties. With12 launches completed so far in 2024, sending nearly 200 satellites into orbit, management continues to appeal to both commercial and government clients. In Q3 alone, the company has secured $55 million in new contracts. Management is projecting Q4 revenue of between $125-135 million. More significantly, Rocket Lab’s total backlog has swelled to a healthy $1.05 billion, providing exceptional visibility into future revenue streams while demonstrating growing market confidence in the company’s capabilities. As many other expanding companies in the sector, such asSpaceX,have discovered, building a vertically integrated approach is essential. By combining launch services with space system development, the company has gained valuable insights across quality control and market intelligence. This structure allows management to identify emerging customer needs early, enhance partnerships, and capture value across the supply chain. Despite the enormous surge over the last year, analysts also seem to share my positive view, providing a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on seven Buys and three Holds. In addition, theaverage RKLB price targetof $20.56 per share implies an upside potential of 3.6%. See more RKLB analyst ratings However, the rapid growth in the share price naturally raises several questions about the sustainability of the company’s valuation, particularly given a fairly high price-to-sales ratio of 23.8 times. Nevertheless, with annual revenue growth exceeding 50%, the underlying business is clearly demonstrating strong momentum, while gross margins above 26% suggest a highly scalable model. The robust cash position provides strategic flexibility, and the growing backlog offers visibility into future revenue streams. As a result, the company warrants close attention. For investors and companies alike, there is clearly a lot of excitement and potential here. The commercial space industry is becoming increasingly competitive as established aerospace firms and well-funded start-ups fight constantly for contracts. As a result of these frequent contract announcements, the firm’s average weekly price movements of 13.6% are notably higher than many in theaerospace and defenseindustry, with a typical 6.7% weekly move. The shareholder structure also potentially warrants attention. Theownershipbreakdown shows institutional investors holding 21.4% of shares, while 46.4% sits with public companies and individual investors. This relatively concentrated ownership could easily impact stock price stability. If a single large owner decides suddenly to double down or, conversely, to walk away, it could quickly spark a race to the exit. Recent insider selling activity over the past three months also raises a few concerns, although the general context remains important. After such a healthy rally, many will suggest that insiders cannot be blamed for taking profits, even if there is further growth ahead. Despite my bullish stance, there are still operational risks to consider. While$442.39 millionin cash provides a substantial runway, total debt of $125.62 million and negative earnings clearly pose ongoing challenges.The forecasted adjusted EBITDA loss of between $27-29 million for Q4 suggests that, for now, profitability remains an ambition rather than a reality. Furthermore, plenty of operational risks exist despite a strong track record of launches. Weather delays, technical challenges, or a single launch failure could significantly impact both revenue and investor confidence. A shift toward larger revenue contribution from space systems, while positive for margins, clearly increases exposure to program execution risks and potential cost overruns on more complex projects. Additionally, government contracts, while lucrative, introduce unique risks. Changes in administrative priorities, budget allocations, or procurement policies could easily limit future opportunities. The company’s growing reliance on government partnerships, particularly throughNASAcollaborations, makes it increasingly sensitive to political and budgetary cycles, with the intentions of the new Trump administration still emerging. Rocket Lab has clearly positioned itself effectively as one of the key players within the expanding space economy sector. The successful diversification into space systems, combined with consistent operational execution and robust financials, creates a strong foundation for continued growth. As the space industry continues its secular expansion, I consider Rocket Lab as extremely well-equipped to capitalize on emerging opportunities, with a strong future ahead of it for the company and investors alike.

Ocko's sale is not isolated but should be viewed in a context of elevated unpredictability: the aerospace business appears to have been relatively immune to the declining economy. Current monetary policies by the Federal Reserve and geopolitical factors remain major drivers to equity markets as long as caution is being taken among investors focusing on high-growth sectors. Rocket Lab launched in 2006 and remains dedicated to improving the Electron rocket launch vehicle and its Neutron medium-lift vehicle. An analysis of this firm's corporate profile shows that it has grown at an impressive rate, and any insight into its future capacity to continue along this growth path will be crucial in retaining investor confidence after this substantial insider trading transaction.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-heres-why-analysts-just-125946137.html,"Rocket Lab USA, Inc.(NASDAQ:RKLB) investors will be delighted, with the company turning in some strong numbers with its latest results. It looks like a positive result overall, with revenues of US$105m beating forecasts by 2.4%. Statutory losses of US$0.10 per share were 2.4% smaller than the analysts expected, likely helped along by the higher revenues. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results. Check out our latest analysis for Rocket Lab USA After the latest results, the twelve analysts covering Rocket Lab USA are now predicting revenues of US$594.2m in 2025. If met, this would reflect a substantial 63% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. The loss per share is expected to greatly reduce in the near future, narrowing 34% to US$0.25. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$596.5m and losses of US$0.24 per share in 2025. Overall it looks as though the analysts were a bit mixed on the latest consensus updates. Although revenue forecasts held steady, the consensus also made a pronounced increase to its losses per share forecasts. Despite expectations of heavier losses next year,the analysts have lifted their price target 84% to US$14.36, perhaps implying these losses are not expected to be recurring over the long term. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Rocket Lab USA at US$25.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$5.00. So we wouldn't be assigning too much credibility to analyst price targets in this case, because there are clearly some widely different views on what kind of performance this business can generate. With this in mind, we wouldn't rely too heavily the consensus price target, as it is just an average and analysts clearly have some deeply divergent views on the business. Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance andindustrygrowth estimates. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 48% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 46% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 4.4% annually. So although Rocket Lab USA is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The most important thing to note is the forecast of increased losses next year, suggesting all may not be well at Rocket Lab USA. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving. Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-announces-third-quarter-211500844.html,"LONG BEACH, Calif., November 12, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"", ""the Company"", ""we,"" ""us,"" or ""our""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today shared the financial results for fiscal third quarter, ended September 30, 2024. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: ""In the third quarter 2024 we once again executed against our end-to-end space strategy with successes and key achievements reached across small and medium launch, as well as space systems. Revenue grew 55% year-on-year to $105 million and we continue to see strong demand growth with our backlog at $1.05 billion. Significant achievements for the quarter included signing a launch service agreement for multiple launches on Neutron with a confidential commercial satellite constellation customer; successfully launching twelve Electron launches year-to-date, making 2024 a record year for launches with more still to come; signing $55 million in new Electron launches, further cementing Electron’s position as a global launch leader; and being selected by NASA to complete a study contract for a proposal to retrieve samples from Mars and return them to Earth as part of a world-first mission. We expect to close out the year strongly with more Electron launches scheduled in November and December, alongside continued progress across Neutron and space systems, that is behind our guidance for a record $125-$135 million revenue quarter in Q4."" Business Highlights for the Third Quarter 2024, plus updates since September 30, 2024. Electron: Achieved a new annual launch record of 12 Electron launches to date, with more scheduled across November and December 2024. Electron is the world’s third most-frequently launched rocket annually by vehicle type and remains the United States’ second most-frequently launched rocket annually. Signed several new Electron launch contracts in Q3 2024 with a total value of $55m, demonstrating an increased average selling price of $8.4m and showcasing a 67% pricing increase since the rocket’s debut launch. Successful Electron launches for three separate commercial satellite constellation operators in Q3, including two missions launched within just eight days. In addition to these, Electron’s most recent mission, launched in the fourth quarter on November 5th, 2024, included an expedited turnaround of just 10 weeks between contract signing and launch. Neutron: Signed a launch service agreement for multiple launches on Neutron with a confidential commercial satellite constellation operator that signifies the beginning of a productive collaboration that could see Neutron deploy the entire constellation. Announced a federal defense contract that supports Neutron and the development of its Archimedes engine with the U.S. Air Force’s Research Laboratory. Doubled engine testing cadence for Archimedes over the quarter at Rocket Lab’s engine test site in Mississippi, alongside strong production execution at the Company’s Engine Development Complex in California which included multiple engines manufactured, assembled, and shipped for engine testing. Significant progress made across Neutron’s structures and infrastructure, including the completion of construction on the rocket’s Assembly, Integration, and Test (A.I.T.) facility in Virginia. Well-positioned to on-ramp to the U.S. Space Force’s National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Lane 1 program, which began accepting proposals in November 2024 to on-ramp new launch providers to an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract valued at $5.6 billion over a five-year period. Space Systems: Completed production and delivery of two spacecraft on time and on budget for NASA’s ESCAPADE mission to Mars. Selected by NASA to complete a study contract for a proposal to retrieve samples from Mars and return them to Earth, a first-of-its-kind mission. Completed two new spacecraft for Varda Space Industries to conduct the 2ndand 3rdmissions to return in-space manufacturing capsules to Earth. Executed on schedule against the Company’s $515 million prime contract with the Space Development Agency to build 18 spacecraft for its Tranche 2 Transport Layer program.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-shares-climb-54th-150926467.html,"Rocket Lab USA (RRLB,Financial) shares rose 4% after the 54th Electron mission, dubbed Changes in Attitudes, ' was successfully placed into orbit. The mission, launched from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand, achieved precision satellite deployment into Low Earth Orbit at exactly 11:54 p.m. on November 5th, 2024, for an unidentified commercial client. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. This launch was the 12th Rocket Lab mission this year, breaking the company's annual record of 10 launches set in 2023. Rocket Lab's electron vehicle reality remains one of the leading market players. It retained the status of the world's third most often launched rocket in terms of vehicle type and the second in the United States. The recent mission also establishes Rocket Lab's high rate of operations, as the launch took place nine weeks after the signing of their contract. This fast cycle from contract signing to implementation is a close end to the years that it took in the past to respond to historical challenges that limited satellite operators' chances to access space substantially. That means Rocket Lab's capability enables customers to initiate more rapid launches for testing out new technologies or even for beginning to generate incomes for satellite constellations prematurely than the existing Rocket Lab timetables allow for. This capability is backed by the conventional manufacturing of Electron rockets and the flexibility demonstrated by its launch locations, indicating the solidity of the business model, anchored on quick delivery. Rocket Lab's founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, was happy with the services delivered, praising the team's efficiency, reliability, speed, and flexibility in servicing the differentiated customer base. Rocket Lab has been on a 12 for 12 in 2024, positioning the company even further to cement its place and offering unmatched value across a wide range of missions, from commercial to civil and national security.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/contract-space-less-ten-weeks-120800307.html,"The contract for Rocket Lab’s latest launch was signed less than ten weeks before lift-off, making it one of the fastest contract-to-launch turnarounds in Company history. LONG BEACH, Calif., November 05, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its 54thElectron mission, deploying a single satellite to Low Earth Orbit for a confidential commercial customer. The ‘Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes’ mission launched from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand at 11:54 pm on November 5th, 2024. The mission was Rocket Lab’s 12thElectron launch this year, continuing to best the Company’s previous record of 10 launches achieved in 2023. Electron remains the world’s third most frequently launched rocket annually by vehicle type, and the United States’ second most frequently launched rocket annually. Today’s mission was launched less than ten weeks from the mission’s launch contract signing, making it one of the Company’s fastest turnarounds yet from contract to launch. Historically it was typical to take years from contract signing to launch, causing bottlenecks and limited launch opportunities for satellite operators. Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket revolutionized this by making it possible for customers to book and launch in just weeks, enabling them to test technologies faster, begin generating revenue from constellations earlier, or gather urgent data from orbit at near on-demand timelines. This business model is enabled by standardized rapid production of Electron launch vehicles, responsive launch sites, proven and established launch systems, and an experienced team capable of delivering rapid call-up launch year-round. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck says: ""Another successful launch showcasing all the best attributes of the Rocket Lab team and Electron: a streamlined process from contract to orbit, pinpoint deployment accuracy, and a responsive service tailored exactly to the customer’s needs. Now 12 for 12 this year across commercial, civil, and national security missions, I’m proud of the team for delivering launch after launch as we continue to deliver a record year across launch and space systems.""

LONG BEACH, Calif., October 16, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has added a last-minute Electron launch to its launch manifest for a commercial mission that is scheduled to launch in just three days’ time.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-awarded-nasa-contract-202032413.html,"NASA has partnered with Rocket Lab (RKLB,Financial) in a new project to expedite and reduce the cost of the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. This deal of $625,000 outlines Rocket Lab's role in identifying other approaches to the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. It may help reduce the estimated final cost of $11 billion and bring forward the return date beyond the estimated 2040 return date. Rocket Lab's plan awoke understanding of using under development Neutron rocket. The specifics of the mission outline for Neutron entail launching two unique satellite systems, each two weeks apart. The first of these could use an Earth Return Orbiter (ERO), with the second bringing a lander spacecraft hosting a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). This vehicle would land on Mars to meet the Perseverance rover, collect returned samples, and bring them to orbit, where they would link with the ERO for the trip back to Earth. Rocket Lab's CEO, Peter Beck, focused on the cost-effective and unconventional mission design of the(box). The company has used the experience gained from the CAPSTONE lunar mission and the ESCAPADE Mars smallsat mission to bolster its bid to transform the MSR strategy. NASA plans to finalize these exploratory studies by this fall and integrate data collected from other significant participants such as Blue Origin, Aerojet Rocketdyne, and SpaceX. The enrollment of all these efforts in cooperation is likely to enhance the MSR plans much more effectively and affordably while shortening the sample return mechanism. These events have been positively described by NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, who seemed to suggest a change of tide on timelines and budget for the MSR mission.

Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) achieved a record revenue of $106 million in Q2 2024, marking a 71% year-on-year increase. The company signed 17 new Electron launch contracts year-to-date, with a total contract value of $141 million. Electron is now the third most frequently launched rocket globally, highlighting its significance in the industry. The Neutron development is progressing well, with the design phase largely complete and production and qualification of flight hardware underway. Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) has a strong backlog of over $1 billion, indicating robust future demand for its services. The company faces challenges in predicting the exact number of launches per year due to customer readiness and scheduling flexibility. Operating expenses increased in Q2 2024, driven by growth in headcount and Neutron development costs. Cash consumed from operations increased to $13 million in Q2 2024, up from $2.6 million in Q1 2024. The company anticipates a pickup in cash consumption in the second half of the year due to increased Neutron CapEx. There is uncertainty regarding the exact timing of achieving cash flow breakeven, which is expected to occur two quarters after the first Neutron launch. Q: What are the next big milestones for Neutron as we approach the first launch next year?A: Peter Beck, CEO, explained that the focus is on infrastructure build, such as the launch pad readiness, and qualification tests like full-scale stage separation and fairing openings. The design phase is complete, and all components are either in production or undergoing qualification testing. Q: How is Rocket Lab managing to develop Neutron at a lower cost compared to other programs?A: Peter Beck, CEO, attributed the cost efficiency to Rocket Lab's aircraft development approach and experience. They build flight-ready engines from the start, avoiding subscale tests, which accelerates development and reduces costs. Q: Can you provide an update on the expected number of Electron launches for the full year?A: Peter Beck, CEO, mentioned that predicting the exact number of launches is challenging due to customer readiness. However, they expect to conduct between 15 and 18 launches this year, with no cancellations, just shifts in timing. Q: What is the status of the SolAero business and its impact on Space Systems margins?A: Adam Spice, CFO, noted that SolAero is moving towards the target 30% gross margin, with new business being signed at this margin. The legacy contract that impacted margins is being phased out, and state and local incentives are expected to further improve margins. Q: How does Rocket Lab plan to approach the data and services market, and what is the timeline for this initiative?A: Peter Beck, CEO, stated that while specific applications are not yet disclosed, Rocket Lab is building capabilities to enter the $320 billion TAM for space services.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-usa-inc-nasdaq-143454167.html,"Institutions' substantial holdings in Rocket Lab USA implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price A total of 8 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Recent sales by insiders A look at the shareholders of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 36% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$1.1b in market cap last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 122%. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Rocket Lab USA, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Rocket Lab USA Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Rocket Lab USA. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Rocket Lab USA's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Rocket Lab USA. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Khosla Ventures, LLC with 13% of shares outstanding. With 10% and 8.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, Equatorial Trust and Deer Management Company, LLC are the second and third largest shareholders. On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 8 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Rocket Lab USA, Inc.. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven't picked up on. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own US$22m worth of shares. Arguably, recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You canclick here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 32% stake in Rocket Lab USA. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. With an ownership of 21%, private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public. It seems that Private Companies own 10%, of the Rocket Lab USA stock. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-labs-meteoric-rise-why-140001580.html,"Satellite launch provider Rocket Labs USA Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) has been one of the most actively traded stocks on the market. It is coming off its most successful quarter yet, marked by record top-line growth and superb expansion in its backlog. Moreover, buoyed by its rapid growth trajectory, analysts are upbeat about its march toward breaking even. Additionally, despite the impressive surge in value, it still has room to run, fueled by positive developments and potential interest rate cuts later in the year. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with DTE. As we look ahead, Rocket Lab's skyward trajectory is tough to ignore. Its spectacular second-quarter showing was backed by the success of its small satellite launch vehicle, Electron, with the upcoming launch of its Neutron medium-lift rocket serving as a key catalyst. Moreover, following its successful Mars-bound spacecraft dispatch, expect further spikes in its value. With that in mind, let's dive deeper into the company's growth narrative and explore why it will continue rewarding its investors. Rocket Lab was established in 2006 by engineer Peter Beck and has quickly established a leadership position in the aerospace industry. The company designs and launches small satellites into space for clients to deliver data and other services. Moreover, it builds rockets that effectively carry these satellites for various purposes like communication, weather monitoring and scientific research. Since the get-go, Rocket Labs sought to solidify its positioning in its niche by evolving into an end-to-end space company. Rocket Lab currently generates 70.60% of its sales from the Space Systems segment and the remaining 29.40% from its Launch Services division. Moreover, with aims to encompass the entire space value chain, we will likely see multiple new revenue streams emerge soon. Rocket Lab's second-quarter results were phenomenal, reporting revenue of $106 million, which was a 71% year-over-year bump. The results also marked the company's highest revenue quarter to date, driven by a superb increase in launches and expansion in the Space Systems segment. Additionally, it maintained a healthy backlog of $1.07 billion, with 44% expected to be realized within the next year. On the profitability front, the company reported a loss of 5 cents per share, but topped estimates by a couple of cents. This mirrored results from the prior-year quarter when it posted identical earnings while surpassing expectations. Additionally, despite the healthy expansion in sales, Rocket Lab experienced a slight drop in gross margins. Despite the uninspiring bottom-line showing, the basic earnings per share stands at -38 cents, but forward projections signal a positive shift, forecasting a loss of 29 cents per share this year and an upswing to a loss of 19 cents in 2025. Rocket Lab's outstanding performance was spearheaded by Electron, its small orbital launch vehicle. Electron is the most frequently launched rocket globally outside of SpaceX this year. Additionally, it achieved the rare feat of reaching 50 launches faster than any other commercially developed rocket. Its growing demand is underscored by the 17 new launches it signed this year, with a total contract value of $141 million. Looking ahead, its Neutron rocket could potentially revolutionize the medium-sized satellite launch market. Company management has set an ambitious number for the medium-lift rocket, targeting a $10 billion launch market by 2025. Moreover, recent results have shown it is already on an encouraging track, led by successful hot-fire tests of its Archimedes engine, setting the stage for a swifter inaugural launch. Arguably, the two biggest aspects to consider in Rocket Lab's narrative are its financial strength and path to profitability. Perhaps the biggest downer with the company is its bottom-line positioning, considering it has yet to break even. Over the past four years, Rocket Lab's net loss has grown by an average of 61%, but in the last couple of years, this growth rate has slowed to around 25% on average. On a positive note, the company has maintained a positive gross margin since 2022, with an impressive 162% growth over the past year. Moreover, the key metrics highlighted in its profitability rank snapshot below point to a healthy improvement compared to its historical performance. However, when compared to the industry and overall market, Rocket Lab still has plenty of work ahead to catch up. A lot of it is linked to its operational expenses, which form a sizeable 78% of its total sales. While the company has successfully reduced research and development expenses as a percentage of sales from 67% in 2021 to 44% as of last year, there is still plenty of progress to be made. On the top-line front, though, the company continues to impress despite the relatively muted growth last year. Revenue growth has averaged at 111% since 2021 and 41% on a trailing 12-month basis. Additionally, Rocket Lab ended the first quarter with over $1 billion in backlog, with about 42% expected to be realized within the next 12 months, setting the stage for another strong year of superb top-line expansion. Further, Rocket Lab's financial strength remains a concern. As shown in the snapshot above, it lags behind both the industry and its historical performance across the first three key financial metrics. Its debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.04, which is the highest it has been in the past decade. Another worrying factor is the gap between Rocket Lab's debt load and cash balance, as illustrated in the chart below. While the company had a sizeable cash buffer in 2021 and 2022, its reserves dropped substantially last year, narrowing the gap with its debt levels. The trend raises concerns over its ability to maintain financial stability while managing its obligations effectively, particularly if cash flow challenges plague its business. Despite the challenges, the consensus is Rocket Lab is positioned to scale up and achieve profitability within the next three years. The analyst estimates suggest the company is well on its way to achieving a positive earnings per share figure by 2026. Its earnings are projected to recover from negative values and approach zero by 2026, signaling potential profitability. Operating cash flow per share is also anticipated to improve, although it is forecasted to remain in the negatives until 2026. As discussed earlier, Rocket Lab has significantly outperformed the broader market across multiple timeframes. Over the past week, the stock surged by over 6% and climbed more than 29% in the past month. Over the past six months, the stock has jumped by 59%, with a year-to-date increase of 26%. RKLBData byGuruFocus The chart above illustrates Rocket Lab's stock price and its 26-day, 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages. The 26-day EMA is the most price-sensitive, followed by the 50-day EMA and the 200-day EMA. From the chart, we can see that the stock has oscillated around these EMAs, indicative of fluctuations in investor sentiment and evolving market dynamics. However, for the most part, we've seen its stock price above the three EMA lines, signaling bullish momentum. Additionally, its stock price consistently trends above the shorter-term 26-day and 50-day EMAs, pointing to bullish momentum of late. Author created based on stock price data The bullishness is confirmed by charts depicting the Moving Average Convergence Divergence and Signal lines. The MACD line (blue) is calculated by subtracting the 26-day EMA from the 12-day EMA, while the Signal line (red) is a nine-day EMA of the MACD line. MACD crossovers above the Signal line signal buying opportunities. From the chart, we can see the MACD line hovers over the Signal line for the bulk of the time period, indicating an uptrend. Moreover, the MACD recently crossed the Signal line, pointing to a buying opportunity. Moreover, from the snapshot above, we can see the stock is poised for stellar growth, with an average 12-month price target of $7.48, reflecting more than a 7% bump from its current price of $6.96. Additionally, the highest analyst target points to a potential jump to $10. On top of that, GuruFocus estimates an even more optimistic GF Value of $12.89, indicating an impressive upside of more than 85%. Analysts' consensus continues to favor the stock, with the majority assigning a ""Buy"" or ""Outperform"" rating. Moreover, with projected 2026 sales, the estimated price-sales ratio is likely to be 3.91, offering a significantly more attractive valuation than the current 10.41 times sales multiple. Rocket Lab is in an excellent position to continue delivering the goods for its investors. Of late, we have seen its top-line grow spectacularly, averaging north of 40% growth on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, it boasts a robust backlog of $1.07 billion, a healthy financial footing and more than $490 million in cash and equivalents. Furthermore, the Electron rocket has solidified its position as a small satellite launch market leader, contributing immensely to its impressive performance. Looking ahead, the upcoming launch of the Neutron rocket could usher in a new era of growth for the business, with its foray into the medium-lift market by 2025. Rocket Lab's technicals point to more upside ahead. The stock has consistently trended above its key moving averages, pointing to bullish momentum. The MACD line hovering above the Signal line further supports a positive outlook, indicating a potential buying opportunity. Hence, with its innovative approach, solid financials and strategic positioning in the space industry, Rocket Lab is poised to deliver substantial long-term returns ahead.

LONG BEACH, Calif., September 03, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has set the launch window for its 53rdElectron Launch. The mission will be the second of five dedicated launches for the French company Kinéis. The ‘Kinéis Killed the RadIOT Star’ mission is scheduled to launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand during a 14-day launch window that opens on September 17, 2024, NZST. This mission will launch just three months after the‘No Time Toulouse’mission, Kinéis’ first launch with Rocket Lab. ‘Kinéis Killed the RadIOT Star’ will be the second of five dedicated Electron launches for Kinéis, a company backed by private and public investors including the French government’s space agency CNES (Centre National d'Études Spatiales) and CLS (Collecte Localisation Satellites), an international space-based solutions provider, to improve global Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity. Kinéis’ constellation will connect any object anywhere in the world and guarantee the transmission of targeted and useful data to users, in near-real time, with low energy consumption with more powerful 30kg-class nanosats that integrate IoT technology. The constellation also includes a second mission: a ship-tracking Automatic Identification System (AIS). Once deployed, these technologies will allow Kinéis to expand across multiple industries and scale from 20,000 devices connected to millions. The second constellation launch will add an additional five new satellites to its planned 25 and will enhance Kinéis’ ability to connect the planet and address essential challenges for humanity, its activities, and its environment. ""We’re excited to welcome the Kinéis team on board Electron again as we help them build out their constellation,"" said Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck. ""Dedicated launch is key for the kind of precise orbital deployment requirements many constellation operators need, so we’re proud to make that possible once again."" ""The Kinéis teams are ready to build on the success of the first launch. They have capitalized on this first and delicate technical experience of putting our first five satellites into position and are delivering a real technical performance in managing the five new satellites simultaneously, in addition to the five already in the air,"" said Alexandre Tisserant, Chairman of Kinéis. ""Rocket Lab's Electron launcher made a major contribution to this success, thanks to the precision with which it injected our nanosatellites into their positions. The IoT revolution is underway. Thanks to our space-based connectivity, we'll be able to connect any object anywhere in the world in near real time. Go Kinéis!"" The ‘Kinéis Killed the RadIOT Star’ launch has been tailored specifically to meet Kinéis’ mission requirements, giving them greater control over launch schedule, orbit, and deployment parameters than would be possible on a larger rideshare mission. Tailored mission parameters for this launch include: Instantaneous launch window, After the first Curie engine burn to circularize the Kick Stage’s orbit, Curie will ignite again for an eight second burn to set a specific argument of perigee, enabling Kinéis to deploy five satellites to a precise location for each one of the five launches, All five satellites will be deployed in a precise sequence in singles and as pairs to build out the constellation exactly as Kinéis needs it, Finally, Curie will conduct a perigee lowering burn to reduce the Kick Stage’s orbital lifetime to keep space sustainable. + About Rocket Lab Founded in 2006, Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-ceo-we-have-the-right-combination-to-break-spacexs-monopoly-194214038.html,"Rocket Lab (RKLB) CEO Peter Beck has positioned himself as an outsider since the company’s inception in 2006. A New Zealand native with no college degree, Beck has long been seen as the anti-Elon Musk. He often reminds employees: “We have no money, so we have to think.” Now, with its Neutron rocket, a fully reusable medium-lift launch vehicle set to take off in mid-2025, Beck says he is poised to pose the most formidable threat to what he describes as a “technical monopoly” held by Elon Musk and SpaceX. ""50% [of Neutron] is to break the monopoly that’s in medium launch right now,"" Beck told Yahoo Finance. ""50% is to be able to launch our own stuff into orbit. I think we have the right combination of expertise and execution to be a real competitor."" Beck sees Neutron as “the last piece of the puzzle” in an ongoing quest to build out an end-to-end space company. Rocket Lab already delivers launch services through its Electron rocket, builds spacecraft and satellite components, and offers on-orbit management. Yet, despite those successes, Neutron presents the biggest opportunity to exert influence in the industry. If Rocket Lab successfully carries out the launch according to its timeline, it would mark the fastest time to market for a commercially developed medium-class launch vehicle. More importantly for Beck, it would inject new competition into a part of the industry SpaceX has largely had to itself. “Nobody can compete with Elon putting internet into space unless you have your own rocket and you have the ability to build whatever spacecraft you want,” Beck said. He added that the company feels “very good” about the launch date, following a successful “hot fire” test of itsnew Archimedes engine. Until recently, launch vehicles have concentrated on small satellite launches, withmore than 200 companiescurrently competing for business. Rocket Lab’s Electron has been a major player with nearly 200 satellites launched so far, but SpaceX has maintained its lead through its SmallSat rideshare program, which utilizes larger payloads on its medium-heavy Falcon 9 rocket, coupled with aggressive pricing. A regular Falcon 9 launch carries a price tag of $3,000 per kilogram, while Rocket Lab offers launches at $22,000 per kilogram,according to Forbes. Clayton Swope, deputy director for the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said medium-size vehicles are more efficient, enabling rocket makers to address a larger need in the market. “You could launch a 1,000-kilogram satellite via a small vehicle, or you could launch a few of those, or 10 of those, or 15 of those via Falcon 9, depending on the orbit,” Swope said. “It's just kind of a multipurpose workhorse-type size of vehicle that's very flexible and can do a lot of different types of missions. So it makes sense that [Rocket Lab] is diversifying in the different business lines to support commercial space.” Rocket Lab has already pushed back its timeline for launch, which was originally scheduled for the end of 2024. But the company has taken aim at SpaceX even before takeoff. In aninterviewlast year, Rocket Lab CFO Adam Spice said the company would be aiming to match SpaceX on a cost-per-kilogram basis for satellite customers, adding that Neutron would target a “$50 million to $55 million launch service cost” compared with Falcon 9’s $67 million price tag. The pipeline for medium-to-heavy-lift rockets is growing. United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture between Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA), completed the inaugural flight for its heavy-lift Vulcan rocket in January, while the Ariane 6, backed by the European Space Agency, completed its first launch last month after years of delays. And Blue Origin’s reusable New Glenn rocket is preparing for a September launch. The increased competition is coming amid growing unease about SpaceX’s dominance and influence over the industry, particularly among lawmakers. Earlier this year, a bipartisan group of 36 lawmakerssent a letterto Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, calling on the Air Force to consider “increased competition among launch providers.” A New York Times analysis estimated that SpaceX has cumulatively been awarded $14.7 billion in federal launch prime contracts over the last decade. “SpaceX has been wildly successful with the Falcon 9,” Beck said. “The challenge with that is if you have a competing constellation that you want to launch to [rival] Starlink, some folks get a little bit uncomfortable with that. Of course, the government doesn't want all its eggs in one basket either. So it's really important we bring some balance to the market with Neutron.” Competition is also heating up outside of the US. Earlier this month, China launched itsfirst satellite constellationinto orbit, an initial step in a stated goal to challenge Starlink’s hold on the market. Beck is quick to point out that two-thirds of Rocket Lab’s business is in space systems, building satellites, and supplying components to customers. The proof, he said, is in the fact that 38% of everything that went into orbit last year had a Rocket Lab logo on it somewhere. On Friday, the companyannounced the shipmentof two Mars-bound spacecraft set for launch in Cape Canaveral, Fla. A successful Neutron launch would pose the most direct challenge to Musk and SpaceX. In the meantime, Beck says the industry is still in its infancy, with plenty of market share up for grabs, and maintains that companies who can’t own the full stack won’t survive. “The launch demand is coming from all directions, not just one or the other,” he said. “The transformation or democratization of space that everybody has been talking about, we are truly into the thick of it.” Click here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-updating-rocket-lab-usa-123037383.html,"It's been a pretty great week forRocket Lab USA, Inc.(NASDAQ:RKLB) shareholders, with its shares surging 15% to US$5.37 in the week since its latest quarterly results. It looks like the results were pretty good overall. While revenues of US$106m were in line with analyst predictions, statutory losses were much smaller than expected, with Rocket Lab USA losing US$0.08 per share. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results. View our latest analysis for Rocket Lab USA Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Rocket Lab USA from eleven analysts is for revenues of US$426.3m in 2024. If met, it would imply a substantial 30% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share losses are predicted to creep up to US$0.38. Before this earnings announcement, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$434.1m and losses of US$0.39 per share in 2024. The consensus price target was unchanged at US$7.25, suggesting that the business - losses and all - is executing in line with estimates. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. The most optimistic Rocket Lab USA analyst has a price target of US$10.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$4.50. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business. Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against theindustryitself. It's clear from the latest estimates that Rocket Lab USA's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 70% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 52% p.a. over the past three years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 2.7% annually. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Rocket Lab USA to grow faster than the wider industry. The most important thing to take away is that the analysts reconfirmed their loss per share estimates for next year. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates. With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Rocket Lab USA. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple Rocket Lab USA analysts - going out to 2026, and you cansee them free on our platform here.

We’ve been consistently impressed with the performance of Archimedes in test, including with this hot fire, so with this critical milestone completed, we move into production of flight engines confidently and begin to close out the qualification test campaign in parallel to really hone performance for launch next year. From the day we started designing Archimedes we focused on delivering a flight engine, rather than an early-stage prototype destined for multiple reworks and adjustments, so it's gratifying to see this strategy bear fruit."" The Archimedes engine will power Rocket Lab’s new reusable medium-lift rocket Neutron, a next-generation challenger to deliver a cost-effective, reliable, and responsive launch service for commercial and government missions. The advanced design of Neutron includes carbon composite for all of the rocket’s major structures and an innovative upper stage that enables high-performance for complex satellite deployments, including the deployment of satellite mega-constellations. The Archimedes engine is an oxidizer rich staged combustion cycle engine that will power the reusable first stage of Neutron and the new rocket’s second stage that is designed to carry up to 13,000 kilograms of payload to space. Capable of producing up to 165,000 (733 kilonewtons) pounds of thrust per engine, Archimedes operates at lower stress levels than other rocket engines to enable rapid and reliable reusability. The combined thrust of nine Archimedes engines for Neutron’s first stage is designed to reach 1,450,000 lbf total. Archimedes uses a cryogenic propellant mix of liquid oxygen and LNG to enable higher reusability and performance, and many of its critical components are 3D printed including Archimedes’ turbo pump housings, pre-burner and main chamber components, valve housings, and engine structural components. Production of the Archimedes engines takes place at Rocket Lab’s Engine Development Complex in Long Beach, California. + About Rocket Lab Founded in 2006, Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-announces-second-quarter-201500206.html,"LONG BEACH, Calif., August 08, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today shared the financial results for fiscal second quarter, ended June 30, 2024. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: ""This year’s second quarter was Rocket Lab’s highest revenue quarter in Company history at $106 million. This 71% year-on-year revenue increase demonstrates the strong and growing demand for our launch services and space systems products, and importantly, our team’s ability to execute against it. Meanwhile, we reached a critical milestone in the development of our new medium lift rocket Neutron, with the successful completion of the first hot fire for the Archimedes engine. Over the same period, we made significant progress in Neutron production and launch infrastructure with the scaling of engine production facilities, installation of the automated fiber placement machine that will produce Neutron’s largest carbon fiber structures, and we furthered development of Launch Complex 3 and the integration and assembly facility on site in Wallops, Virginia. On the small launch front, Electron remains the leading small rocket globally with successful launches in the quarter for government and commercial customers, and demand for it continues to grow with 17 new launches signed so far this year. We also continue to reach development and production milestones across our space systems programs, in which we have more than $720 million in spacecraft under contract. Some significant achievements on this front include the completion of twin Rocket Lab-designed and built satellites for a NASA mission to Mars, as well as completing successful development reviews for the government and commercial constellations we have in work.""

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-usa-inc-nasdaq-114653352.html,"Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB)is possibly approaching a major achievement in its business, so we would like to shine some light on the company. Rocket Lab USA, Inc., a space company, provides launch services and space systems solutions for the space and defense industries. The US$2.8b market-cap company’s loss lessened since it announced a US$183m loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$181m, as it approaches breakeven. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Rocket Lab USA will turn a profit, with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?” We've put together a brief outline of industry analyst expectations for the company, its year of breakeven and its implied growth rate. View our latest analysis for Rocket Lab USA Rocket Lab USA is bordering on breakeven, according to the 11 American Aerospace & Defense analysts. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2025, before turning a profit of US$2.5m in 2026. The company is therefore projected to breakeven around 2 years from now. In order to meet this breakeven date, we calculated the rate at which the company must grow year-on-year. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 59% is expected, which signals high confidence from analysts. If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict. We're not going to go through company-specific developments for Rocket Lab USA given that this is a high-level summary, but, take into account that generally a high forecast growth rate is not unusual for a company that is currently undergoing an investment period. One thing we would like to bring into light with Rocket Lab USA is its relatively high level of debt. Typically, debt shouldn’t exceed 40% of your equity, which in Rocket Lab USA's case is 85%. Note that a higher debt obligation increases the risk around investing in the loss-making company.

""For years now, I’ve been proud to bolster New Mexico’s bases, defense research labs, and private industry partners so we can keep excelling in emerging defense fields. That includes supporting the growth of SolAero, now Rocket Lab—a homegrown New Mexico defense technology company that has become an industry leader in manufacturing solar cells for space-based defense systems and commercial satellites. This exciting investment is just the latest downpayment to maintain New Mexico’s longtime leadership in national security and innovation."" ""I am so excited that SolAero will get almost $24 million to expand and modernize their facilities right in the heart of New Mexico’s 1st Congressional District,"" saidRep. Melanie Stansbury. ""Thanks to the Biden Administration and the CHIPS and Science Act, more than 100 new manufacturing jobs will be created, and New Mexico will continue leading the way in technological manufacturing. The future is bright!"" ""These 100-plus good-paying jobs will support hard-working New Mexicans, while strengthening our national security through domestic semiconductor manufacturing,""said Rep. Gabe Vasquez.""This funding for Rocket Lab will help ensure that vital semiconductors are made in America and solidify New Mexico's role as a leader in space technology. Recognizing New Mexico’s robust workforce and investment potential is crucial, and I will always work to bring good-paying jobs to our state."" ""Not only will this $23.9M investment help strengthen our national security and increase the amount of advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the United States, it will create more than 100 good paying jobs for New Mexicans,"" saidCongresswoman Teresa Leger Fernández. ""With this funding, our satellites won’t be dependent on foreign sources for solar power, and instead use American-manufactured solar cells made from compound semiconductors. Manufacturing is growing in New Mexico and this is exactly the kind of growth we had in mind when we passed the CHIPS and Science Act."" Rocket Lab has indicated that it plans to claim the Department of the Treasury’s Investment Tax Credit, which is expected to be up to 25% of qualified capital expenditures. As explained in its first Notice of Funding Opportunity, the Department may offer applicants a PMT on a non-binding basis after satisfactory completion of the merit review of a full application. The PMT outlines key terms for a potential CHIPS incentives award, including the amount and form of the award. The award amounts are subject to due diligence and negotiation of award documents and are conditional on the achievement of certain milestones. After the PMT is signed, the Department begins a comprehensive due diligence process on the proposed projects and continues negotiating or refining certain terms with the applicant. The terms contained in any final award documents may differ from the terms of the PMT being announced today. + About CHIPS for America CHIPS for America is part of President Biden’s economic plan to invest in America, stimulate private sector investment, create good-paying jobs, make more in the United States, and revitalize communities left behind. CHIPS for America includes the CHIPS Program Office, responsible for manufacturing incentives, and the CHIPS Research and Development Office, responsible for R&D programs, that both sit within the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at the Department of Commerce. NIST promotes U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-sets-launch-date-100000804.html,"The milestone mission is the first of five dedicated launches to deploy a 25-satellite constellation for French Internet-of-Things company Kinéis LONG BEACH, Calif., June 07, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the launch window for the Company’s 50thElectron launch. The mission will deploy five Internet-of-Things (IoT) satellites for French company Kinéis. The ‘No Time Toulouse’ mission is scheduled to launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand during a 14-day launch window that opens on June 19th, 2024, NZST. The mission is the first of five dedicated Electron launches for Kinéis, a company backed by private and public investors including the French government’s space agency CNES (Centre National d'Études Spatiales) and CLS (Collecte Localisation Satellites) an international space-based solutions provider, to improve global IoT connectivity. Kinéis’ new constellation will connect any object anywhere in the world and guarantee the transmission of targeted and useful data to users, in near-real time, with low energy consumption with more powerful 30kg-class nanosats that integrate IoT technology. The constellation also includes a second mission: a ship-tracking Automatic Identification System (AIS). Once deployed, these technologies will allow Kinéis to expand across multiple industries and scale from 20,000 devices connected to millions. ""The launch industry is not an easy or forgiving one. Making it to your first launch is not a given, so reaching 50 Electron launches is an enormous achievement and a rare feat in the history of spaceflight,"" said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck. ""I’m immensely proud of the team for bringing an industry-defining rocket to market, making frequent and reliable dedicated small launch a reality for the first time. We’re excited to launch Kinéis on this historic mission and grateful for the continued support of all the customers who have flown on Electron since our very first mission in 2017. Thank you for helping us to make Electron one of the most frequently launched rockets of all time."" Kinéis CEO Alexandre Tisserant said: ""Kinéis is proud and confident to entrust the deployment of its constellation to Rocket Lab. The Electron launcher meets our technical requirements for the positioning of five nanosatellites for each dedicated launch. Our teams and those of Rocket Lab are well coordinated to ensure the satellite separation phase with the launcher. We are very honoured that this first launch for Kinéis coincides with Electron's 50th flight!"" The ‘No Time Toulouse’ launch has been tailored specifically to meet Kinéis’ mission requirements, giving them greater control over launch schedule, orbit, and deployment parameters than would be possible on a larger rideshare mission. Tailored mission parameters for this launch include: Instantaneous launch window, After the first Curie engine burn to circularize the Kick Stage’s orbit, Curie will ignite again for an eight second burn to set a specific argument of perigee, enabling Kinéis to deploy five satellites to a precise location for each one of the five launches, All five satellites will be deployed in a precise sequence in singles and as pairs to build out the constellation exactly as Kinéis needs it, Finally, Curie will conduct a perigee lowering burn to reduce the Kick Stage’s orbital lifetime to keep space sustainable. Electron’s 50thlaunch by the numbers. The ‘No Time Toulouse’ mission will mark: 50thElectron launch since the Company’s first launch on May 25th, 2017. 499 Rutherford engines sent to space. Each Electron launch features 10 Rutherford engines, including nine on the first stage and a single vacuum optimized Rutherford engine on the second stage. Rocket Lab successfully flew a recovered Rutherford engine in 2023, hence 499 engines rather than 500. 46 missions from Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand. 4 missions from Launch Complex 2 in Virginia, USA. 190 satellites launched by Electron.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-rocket-lab-usa-104518844.html,"Rocket Lab USA's Annual General Meeting to take place on 12th of June Salary of US$500.0k is part of CEO Peter Beck's total remuneration Total compensation is 75% below industry average Over the past three years,Rocket Lab USA's EPS grew by 32%and over the past three years, the total loss to shareholders 58% Performance atRocket Lab USA, Inc.(NASDAQ:RKLB) has been rather uninspiring recently and shareholders may be wondering how CEO Peter Beck plans to fix this. They will get a chance to exercise their voting power to influence the future direction of the company in the next AGM on 12th of June. Setting appropriate executive remuneration to align with the interests of shareholders may also be a way to influence the company performance in the long run. We have prepared some analysis below to show that CEO compensation looks to be reasonable. See our latest analysis for Rocket Lab USA Our data indicates that Rocket Lab USA, Inc. has a market capitalization of US$2.1b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$963k for the year to December 2023. We note that's an increase of 15% above last year. In particular, the salary of US$500.0k, makes up a fairly large portion of the total compensation being paid to the CEO. In comparison with other companies in theAmerican Aerospace & Defense industrywith market capitalizations ranging from US$1.0b to US$3.2b, the reported median CEO total compensation was US$3.8m. In other words, Rocket Lab USA pays its CEO lower than the industry median. Component 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary US$500k US$487k 52% Other US$463k US$351k 48% Total Compensation US$963k US$838k 100% Talking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 24% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 76% of the pie. It's interesting to note that Rocket Lab USA pays out a greater portion of remuneration through salary, compared to the industry. If total compensation veers towards salary, it suggests that the variable portion - which is generally tied to performance, is lower. Over the past three years, Rocket Lab USA, Inc. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) grow by 32% per year. Its revenue is up 25% over the last year. Shareholders would be glad to know that the company has improved itself over the last few years. Most shareholders would be pleased to see strong revenue growth combined with EPS growth. This combo suggests a fast growing business. Looking ahead, you might want to checkthis free visual report onanalyst forecastsfor the company's future earnings.. Few Rocket Lab USA, Inc. shareholders would feel satisfied with the return of -58% over three years. This suggests it would be unwise for the company to pay the CEO too generously. The fact that shareholders are sitting on a loss is certainly disheartening. This contrasts to the strong EPS growth recently however, and suggests that there may be other factors at play driving down the share price. A key focus for the board and management will be how to align the share price with fundamentals. The upcoming AGM will provide shareholders the opportunity to raise their concerns and evaluate if the board’s judgement and decision-making is aligned with their expectations. CEO compensation can have a massive impact on performance, but it's just one element. We did our research and spotted2 warning signs for Rocket Lab USAthat investors should look into moving forward.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-sets-date-second-203000187.html,"The launch is the second of two dedicated Electron launches for NASA’s PREFIRE mission to detect heat loss over the Arctic and Antarctica LONG BEACH, Calif., May 29, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today confirmed the scheduled launch date for the second of two back-to-back Electron launches for NASA’s PREFIRE (Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment) climate change-focused mission. The ‘PREFIRE and Ice’ launch is scheduled to take place on 1 June NZST just seven days after the first PREFIRE launch, ‘Ready, Aim, PREFIRE,’ which successfully launched on May 25th, 2024. ‘PREFIRE and Ice’ will lift-off from Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand during a launch window that opens at 3:00 pm NZST (03:00 am, 1 June UTC). NASA’s PREFIRE mission consists of two shoebox-size cube satellites that will measure the amount of heat Earth radiates into space from Earth’s poles. Data from the PREFIRE mission will help researchers better predict how Earth’s ice, seas, and weather will change in a warming world. At the heart of the PREFIRE mission is Earth’s energy budget – the balance between incoming heat energy from the Sun and the outgoing heat given off by the planet. The difference between the two is what determines the planet’s temperature and climate. A lot of the heat radiated from the Arctic and Antarctica is emitted as far-infrared radiation, but there is currently no detailed measurement of this type of energy. The water vapor content of the atmosphere, along with the presence, structure, and composition of clouds, influences the amount of far-infrared radiation that escapes into space from Earth’s poles. Data collected from PREFIRE will give researchers information on where and when far-infrared energy radiates from the Arctic and Antarctic environments into space. Rocket Lab’s ability to launch dedicated missions to precise orbits in quick succession is critical to the success of PREFIRE. The mission requires two separate satellites to follow similar trajectories but along different paths to overlap with each other every few hours near the Arctic and Antarctica and capture accurate heat loss measurements. ‘PREFIRE and Ice’ will be Rocket Lab’s 49thElectron launch overall and seventh launch of 2024.

We've got a lot of great achievements and milestones to share on our start to the year, not the least of which is executing a record number of launches and space systems growth that delivered a record total revenue of $93 million in the quarter, up 55% quarter-over-quarter and 69% year-over-year. Adam will talk through the rest of the details of our financial results for the first quarter before covering the financial outlook for Q2 2024. After that, we'll take some questions and finish today's call with the near-term conferences we will be attending. All right. Onto what we achieved in the first quarter of the year, starting with Electron. We had a great series of launches in Q1 with four successful missions, three of them for commercial customers from Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand and a national security mission for the NRO out of our second site in Virginia. We had to launch -- we had a launch turnaround of just eight days between our flight for the Japanese customers inspective in the NRO launch, which was no small task from two launch sites across the world. In fact, we remain the only company with the capability of orbital launch from both hemispheres. It really demonstrates the capability of the team to turn around launches so quickly and sets us up well to execute against our pack manifest for 2024. We completed our fifth launch of the year less than two weeks ago, a commercial mission for KAIST Institute of South Korea, along with a landmark scientific mission for NASA to test our solar sailing technology also on board. Note here rideshared missions are the same, and this launch, in particular, was a tricky and complex one that played into our unique strengths.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-completes-archimedes-engine-203700564.html,"The new 3D printed, reusable rocket engine for Rocket Lab’s Neutron launch vehicle begins an intensive test campaign at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi in preparation for Neutron’s first launch LONG BEACH, Calif., May 06, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has completed the first full assembly of its Archimedes engine, the new 3D printed, reusable, rocket engine for the Company’s Neutron medium lift launch vehicle. Rocket Lab has now begun an intensive test campaign that will feature a number of engine system activations leading up to a first Archimedes hot-fire. The Archimedes test campaign will take place at Rocket Lab’s dedicated engine test stand at America’s largest rocket propulsion test site, NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. As an oxidizer rich staged combustion cycle powered by liquid oxygen and methane, Archimedes is a unique rocket engine of its thrust class, engine cycle, and propellant combination. The engine is designed for maximum reusability, with an operating point that allows the engine to operate at a lower stress levels comparative to other rocket engines on the market, and with a minimum reuse target of up to 20 launches per engine. At full power, each Archimedes engine is capable of producing 165,000 lbf (733 kilonewtons) for a combined total of 1,450,000 million lbf on Neutron’s first stage. Critical 3D printed parts to undergo testing include Archimedes’ turbo pump housings, pre-burner and main chamber components, valve housings, and engine structural components. Many component, subsystem, and all-up system tests will be conducted throughout the test campaign. These tests will validate Archimedes’ transient start-up, steady-state, and shut down performance. The engine test and development campaign is a key driver of the schedule for Neutron’s first launch, which the Company today confirmed is now expected to take place no earlier than mid-2025. ""Having a completed Archimedes engine on the test stand is an inflection point in Neutron’s development program. Now we’ve entered the home stretch where we breathe fire and refine the engine in preparation for first flight,"" said Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Peter Beck. ""Often with engine development plans there can be a rush to get a minimum viable product to the stand, after which you have to spend years in redesign and iterative testing to get the performance you need, let alone being able to reproduce it reliably on a large production scale. What we’ve taken to the test stand is very close to a flight-like engine, and with all of our production infrastructure stood up alongside the engine’s development, we’re in a prime position to be able to make quick iterations to Archimedes for a rapid development and qualification campaign. We took the time to not only bring a mature design to the stand that has been thoroughly tested at component level, but to also stand up the experienced team, manufacturing line, and test facilities required to support long term production of Archimedes. This approach has ultimately pushed the first flight to mid-2025 at the earliest, but it’s an approach we believe will deliver the frequent flight rates the market needs quickly after flight one. Designing a brand-new rocket engine to meet the market demand for frequent and reliable launch is complex feat, but it’s something we’ve successfully done before, having launched more than 470 Rutherford engines to space. We look forward to repeating this success with Archimedes."" Production of subsequent Archimedes engines is continuing in parallel with the ongoing test campaign, with long-lead 3D printed components already manufactured and undergoing checkouts and analysis ahead of integration and engine full assembly at Rocket Lab’s Engine Development Complex in Long Beach, California. Additional recent milestones on the path to first Neutron launch include the completion of carbon composite flight structures for Neutron’s fairing panels, Stage 1 and Stage 2 tanks, and the reusable Stage 1 structure. Infrastructure development is also continuing at pace across Neutron’s dedicated launch site at Wallops Island, Virginia, with completed foundation concrete works for Neutron’s launch mount and propellant and gas storage facilities, and installation of the site’s 278 ft water tower. About the Archimedes engine Archimedes is the 3D printed, reusable rocket engine designed and manufactured by Rocket Lab to power the Company’s new Neutron rocket. Capable of lifting up to 13,000kg, Archimedes is an oxygen-rich staged combustion engine powered by liquid oxygen and methane that is designed for rapid reusability. Neutron will include nine Archimedes engines on its reusable first stage for a total combined thrust of 1,450,000 lbf. The single vacuum-optimized version of Archimedes on Neutron’s second stage shares all major components with the first stage engine and is capable of up to 202,300 lbf (900kN). Both versions of Archimedes are designed for multiple restarts, with the vacuum Archimedes designed to start up to six times while in space to perform complex orbital maneuvers for payload delivery in multiple orbits or more complex orbits. Archimedes is intentionally designed to operate within medium-range capability, a choice that lowers thermal and operational strains across the engine to improve its life and reliability, and meet the rapid reusability requirements of Neutron. Full-rate production of the Archimedes engines will take place at Rocket Lab’s Engine Development Complex at its headquarters in Long Beach, California. + About Rocket Lab Founded in 2006, Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success.

The non-GAAP financial information presented excludes certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the company's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial information to the corresponding GAAP measures for the historical periods disclosed are included at the end of the tables in this press release. We have not provided a reconciliation for forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures because, without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the amount and timing of adjustments that are used to calculate these non-GAAP financial measures, particularly related to stock-based compensation and its related tax effects. The following definitions are provided: + ADJUSTED EBITDA EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Such items are excluded from net income or loss to determine Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes this measure provides investors meaningful insight into results from ongoing operations. + OTHER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Non-GAAP gross profit, research and development, net, selling, general and administrative, operating expenses, operating loss and total other income (expense), net, further excludes items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Such items are excluded from the applicable GAAP financial measure. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors meaningful insight into results from ongoing operations.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-prepares-back-back-205300206.html,"NASA’s PREFIRE mission requires two satellites to be deployed to precise orbits one after the other, demonstrating Electron’s highly responsive launch capability. LONG BEACH, Calif., April 29, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it is preparing two back-to-back Electron launches to deploy NASA’s PREFIRE (Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment) mission. The two dedicated missions will each deploy one satellite to a 525km circular orbit from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand. The first mission – named ‘Ready, Aim, PREFIRE’ – is scheduled to launch no earlier than May 22, 2024. The launch date of the second mission – named ‘PREFIRE And Ice’ – will be scheduled to take place within three weeks of the successful deployment of the first PREFIRE mission. The missions will be Rocket Lab’s 48thand 49thElectron launches overall and its sixth and seventh launches of 2024. NASA’s PREFIRE mission is a climate change-focused mission that will systematically measure the heat, in the form of infrared and far-infrared wavelengths, lost from Earth’s polar regions for the first time. Extreme storms, flooding, and coastal erosion are examples of weather outcomes that are influenced by climate conditions in the Arctic and Antarctica. Once deployed to their separate orbits, the two PREFIRE satellites will criss-cross over the Arctic and Antarctica measuring thermal infrared radiation – the same type of energy emitted from a heat lamp – that will make climate models more accurate and help predict changes caused by global warming. PREFIRE consists of two 6U CubeSats with a baseline mission length of 10 months. ""Helping climate scientists better understand climate change means they need precisely located measurements of Earth’s polar heat loss, which NASA’s PREFIRE mission is setting out to achieve, and helping the PREFIRE mission achieve its science objectives means its satellites need precise and accurate deployments to their locations in space,"" says Rocket Lab Founder and CEO, Peter Beck. ""It’s these types of missions where Electron really thrives as the leading launch provider for dedicated small satellite missions. We have an excellent track record of delivering NASA’s payloads to exactly where they need to go and when they need to, and we’re looking forward to adding to that tally further with these next back-to-back launches."" PREFIRE is the latest to join Rocket Lab’s list of NASA science and technology missions launched on Electron in recent years. These include the CAPSTONE mission to the Moon launched by Electron and deployed by a Rocket Lab Explorer spacecraft bus; two back-to-back Electron launches for the TROPICS mission in May 2023; the recent NASA Starling mission launched on Electron; and NASA’s ACS3 mission launched last month on a rideshare mission. ‘Ready, Aim, PREFIRE’ launch details: Launch date: no-earlier-than May 22, 2024.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firefly-ceo-sees-enough-demand-for-fully-commercial-lunar-missions-independent-of-nasa-100015179.html,"When Firefly Aerospace launches its Blue Ghost landerto the moon's surfacelater this year, it will do so on board a SpaceX rocket and with $112 million in funding from NASA. But CEO Bill Weber sees a future in which the Texas-based firm goes it alone, completing fully commercial lunar missions on a medium-size rocket built in-house — with no funding from NASA. ""Commercial industry needs to be running that transit,"" Weber told Yahoo Finance in an interview. ""And the government, instead of being the prime contract driver, will utilize that capacity. We’re at that point where we’re about to flip. There's most definitely enough demand on the commercial side."" Weber’s ambitions point to the rapid evolution of a new space economy that is increasingly being driven by commercial interests. Borrowing a playbook from SpaceX and itsfounder Elon Musk, firms like Firefly are moving quicker, building bigger, and slashing costs in the process, bringing a tech startup-like mentality to space exploration. That push is expanding the reach of space companies beyond launch systems and satellites. The World Economic Forum forecast the space economy to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, growing at a rate of 9% annually. Five industries, including supply chain, retail, and consumer goods, are expected to generate more than60% of that increase in the next 10 yearsas demand grows for applications such as satellite data and communications. “The lower cost of entry to get things into orbit has really caused a shift in the industry and brought a lot of excited, ambitious folks in a very quick way,” said Matt Martinez, managing director and partner at BCG. Commercial demand stemming from increased access to space is supercharging Firefly’s expansion plans. Founded in 2017, the company has billed itself as an end-to-end space transportation company, aiming to play in every step of the process required from launch to deployment of satellites. The company's mission to ""launch, land, and orbit"" is displayed on banners that hang above its sprawling 200-acre Rocket Ranch, located an hour outside of Austin, Texas. Inside one complex, engineers manufacture Firefly’s smaller rocket known as Alpha, while the second building is dedicated to building its new medium launch vehicle (MLV), developed in partnership with Northrop Grumman (NOC). Outside, Firefly has six test stands, where employees conduct rocket engine tests almost every day. “The thing that sets Firefly apart from others is how much is built in-house,” said Brigette Oakes, vice president of engineering. “Having an integration machine shop, composite manufacturing, engine testing, stage testing allows us to build these rockets at a pace as quickly as our customers want it essentially.” In 2023, the company launched a satellite into orbit 27 hours after receiving orders from the US Space Force. That shattered a previous response time of 21 days. That ability to move quickly and lower costs is expanding the limits of space exploration. Today, companies like Space X and Rocket Lab (RKLB) are launching every 34 hours,according to the Space Foundation, putting the globe on track for 259 launches this year. While Firefly has only successfully launched three rockets into orbit, it doubled the size of its facilities to automate much of its production in anticipation of a ramp-up. A newly automated fiber placement machine installed last year now allows the company to churn out the vehicle structure for its Alpha rocket in seven days and the MLV in 30 days. That’s nine times faster and seven times cheaper than the laser-guided process engineers previously relied on, according to Oakes. Growth within the commercial space economy has largely been limited to launch vehicles and satellites until now, but NASA is leaning on the private sector to take them even further. ItsCommercial Lunar Payload Services programhas set aside $2.6 billion for more than a dozen companies to develop a low-cost transportation system to carry the agency’s research to the lunar surface along with payloads for commercial customers. Firefly will launch its Blue Ghost lunar lander onboard a SpaceX rocket later this year, the third attempt by a commercial company to reach the moon's surface following limited success by Intuitive Machines (LUNR) andAstrobotic. “What is happening is we are bringing business on the face of the Earth into space,” said NASA administrator Bill Nelson. “We've got these small little startup companies that are providing landers for NASA experiments as we can survey the south pole of the moon before our astronauts ever get there.” A single lander mission is expected to cost roughly $100 million for Firefly, a fraction of the $660 million NASA paid for similar lander missions in the 1960s when adjusted for inflation. The Blue Ghost launch later this year will be the first of two Firefly missions backed by NASA. The second mission, scheduled to reach the south pole of the moon in 2026, will launch on board the MLV, allowing the company to move forward without the help of SpaceX. While both will carry NASA experiments to the lunar surface, Weber said the company now plans to conduct its own mission to the moon with ""100% commercial payloads"" to accommodate requests from customers unable to hitch ""a ride"" on the early missions. The company has no plans to receive funding from NASA for its independent mission, though the agency could be a paying customer, Weber said. Today, Firefly generates more than 60% of its revenue from launch systems. The other 40% is derived from its spacecraft business, which includes Blue Ghost and orbital vehicle Elytra. Weber said he expects to be profitable on the company’s lunar missions by the end of this decade. “If your only business is lunar missions and landing on the moon, then you're going to have a really difficult time with a diversified revenue structure,” he said. “Because there are three different mechanisms there that we can serve customers with from the same engineering base, the same manufacturing base, and the same supply chain feeding all of that, we can do, at minimal profit, missions like this.” Click here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-usa-inc-nasdaq-140303660.html,"The considerable ownership by individual investors in Rocket Lab USA indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy The top 7 shareholders own 51% of the company Insiders have sold recently If you want to know who really controls Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 32% to be precise, is individual investors. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Following a 3.1% increase in the stock price last week, individual investors profited the most, but institutions who own 32% stock also stood to gain from the increase. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Rocket Lab USA. Check out our latest analysis for Rocket Lab USA Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Rocket Lab USA. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Rocket Lab USA, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Rocket Lab USA. Khosla Ventures, LLC is currently the largest shareholder, with 16% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 10% and 8.3% of the stock. On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 7 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. in their own names. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own US$8.0m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checkingif those insiders have been selling. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 32% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. With an ownership of 25%, private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public. Our data indicates that Private Companies hold 10%, of the company's shares. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Rocket Lab USA better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified2 warning signs for Rocket Lab USAthat you should be aware of. But ultimatelyit is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

(Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today deployed two satellites to two different orbits approximately 500km apart on its 47thElectron mission. The ""Beginning Of The Swarm"" (B.T.S.) mission lifted-off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand at 10:32 NZST on April 24th, 2024 with payloads for the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and NASA. The primary payload, NEONSAT-1 by KAIST, was first deployed by Electron to a 520km circular Earth orbit before Electron deployed NASA’s Advanced Composite Solar Sail System to a higher circular orbit at 1,000km. NEONSAT-1 will perform Earth-observation of the Korean Peninsula for KAIST, which will then pair the satellite’s data with artificial intelligence to monitor for natural disasters in the region. NEONSAT-1 is the first of 11 satellites for KAIST’s planned constellation to image the Korean Peninsula several times daily. The second mission deployed today was NASA’s Advanced Composite Solar Sail System, which is a technology demonstration of new materials that use sunlight to propel a spacecraft. Much like a sailboat is powered by wind pushing against a sail, solar sails employ the pressure of sunlight for propulsion to move around. This mission plans to test how well new composite booms unfurl the sail from the spacecraft – which is about the size of a toaster – to an area about the size of a small apartment. Data from this mission will be used for designing future larger-scale composite solar sail systems for space weather early warning satellites, asteroid and other small body reconnaissance missions, and missions to observe the polar regions of the sun. The capability to deploy two satellites more than 500km apart on the same launch is enabled by Electron’s Kick Stage, a small stage with engine relight capability to enable last-mile delivery. After deploying NEONSAT-1, Electron’s Kick Stage completed multiple in-space burns of its Curie engine to raise its apogee and circularize its orbit before deploying the Advanced Composite Solar Sail System spacecraft. The Kick Stage then completed a fourth and final engine light to perform a deorbit maneuver that returned the stage closer to Earth to speed up its eventual deorbit, helping to reduce long term orbital debris. Today’s successful mission was Rocket Lab’s fifth launch of 2024, continuing Electron’s streak as the United States’ second-most frequently launched rocket annually. Details of Rocket Lab’s next Electron mission will be announced shortly. + About Rocket Lab Founded in 2006, Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-returns-previously-flown-123000495.html,"The carbon composite first stage tank from the Electron rocket, successfully launched and recovered in January this year, has entered back into the standard Electron production line to undergo final acceptance testing and qualification ahead of reflight. COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., April 10, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or ""the Company"") today announced it is returning a previously flown Electron rocket first stage tank into the Electron production line for the first time in preparation for reflying the stage. The step is a significant milestone in Rocket Lab’s development program to make Electron the world’s first reusable small orbital launch vehicle. Rocket Lab has successfully recovered multiple Electron first stages from previous missions by returning them to Earth under a parachute after launch, splashing them down in the ocean, then collecting them onto a specially modified boat for transfer back to Rocket Lab’s production complex. All previously recovered boosters have undergone extensive analysis to inform an iterative development process to make Electron reusable, but this is the first time a tank has been moved back onto the standard production line in preparation for reflight. The stage was successfully launched and recovered as part of the ‘Four of a Kind’ mission on 31 January 2024 and has already passed more acceptance tests than any other recovered Electron stage, including: Tank pressurization test – a process that filled the carbon composite tank with inert gas and held it in excess of maximum operating pressure for more than 20x longer than the standard Electron flight duration; Helium leak check – a stringent process that determines there are no leaks in the tank; and Carbon fiber structural testing – including ultrasonic assessment and other non-destructive tests to confirm no delamination of the carbon composite tank fibers. The stage will now undergo final fit out and rigorous qualification and acceptance testing to the same standard as a brand-new Electron tank to determine the recovered stage’s suitability for reflight. ""Through an iterative development process, we have methodically perfected each step of Electron recovery while simultaneously continuing to increase our Electron production capacity and launch cadence. This is the exciting final piece of the puzzle before Electron goes reusable,"" said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck. ""Our key priority in pushing this stage back into the standard production flow for the first time is to ensure our systems and qualification processes are fit for accepting pre-flown boosters at scale. If this stage successfully passes and is accepted for flight, we’ll consider opportunities for reflying it in the new year."" Rocket Lab has carried out iterative modifications across multiple recovery missions to hone the recovery process ahead of first reflight, including: Ensuring Electron’s carbon composite structure survives the intense heat and forces of atmospheric reentry through innovative coatings, heat shields, and advanced reaction control systems to control the angle of reentry; Refining the parachute system to ensure reliable deployment and smooth deceleration from more than 2,300 meters per second to 10 meters per second; Honing the telemetry and tracking systems so the marine recovery team can locate the stage as soon as it splashes down; Streamlining the process of collecting the stage from the water in less than an hour, then ensuring safe transit back to the Rocket Lab production complex; and Successful launch of a previously flown Rutherford engine. The payload scheduled to launch on the recovered stage will be announced following the completion of final acceptance and qualification testing. + About Rocket Lab Founded in 2006, Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-prepares-launch-mission-201500316.html,"This latest mission will see Rocket Lab perform multiple in-space engine burns to deploy two payloads to separate orbits several hundred kilometres apart. LONG BEACH, Calif., April 01, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has set the launch window for its next Electron launch. The ‘Beginning Of The Swarm’ mission is scheduled to launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand during a 14-day launch window that opens on April 24th. Electron will carry two satellites for two separate customers: NEONSAT-1, an Earth observation satellite for the Satellite Technology Research Center (SaTReC) at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), and NASA’s Advanced Composite Solar Sail System (ACS3). The primary payload for this mission, NEONSAT-1, is an Earth observation satellite with a high-resolution optical camera designed to monitor for natural disasters along the Korean Peninsula by pairing its images with artificial intelligence. NEONSAT-1 is the first satellite developed under the NEONSAT program by SaTReC and KAIST, Korea’s leading university in science and technology, which developed and operated Korea’s very first satellite KITSAT-1 more than 30 years ago. Other NEONSAT satellites are planned to be launched in 2026 and 2027 to build out the NEONSAT constellation. The program is a collaboration across multiple Korean academic, industry, and research institutions including SaTReC in KAIST, which is leading the program’s system design and engineering; the SaTReC Initiative, a Korean satellite manufacturer that has successfully developed seven previous remote sensing satellites for low Earth orbit; and the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), which is managing the mission’s ground segments and technology supervision for the NEONSAT program. NEONSAT is funded by the Koren government’s Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT). NASA’s ACS3 is a technology demonstration of new materials and deployable structures for solar sail propulsion systems that use sunlight to propel the spacecraft. Much like a sailboat is powered by wind pushing against a sail, solar sails employ the pressure of sunlight for propulsion, eliminating the need for conventional rocket propellant. The mission plans to test the deployment of new composite booms that will unfurl the solar sail to measure approximately 30 feet per side, or about the size of a small apartment in total. Flight data obtained during the demonstration will be used for designing future larger-scale composite solar sail systems for space weather early warning satellites, asteroid and other small body reconnaissance missions, and missions to observe the polar regions of the sun. The ACS3 was designed and built at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, and the technology demonstration is managed and funded by the Small Spacecraft Technology program at and with NASA’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley. NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, interested in larger solar sail missions in the future, is funding an extended operations component to execute a series of maneuvers to raise and lower the spacecraft’s orbit, demonstrating the practicality of solar sailing. The capability of Electron’s Kick Stage to perform multiple engine burns in space and deploy individual satellites to unique orbits is critical to this mission. The Kick Stage will first ignite its Curie engine to deploy NEONSAT-1 to its target 520km circular Earth orbit. After the payload’s separation, it will ignite its Curie engine again to perform an apogee raise to 1,000km. Once in this phasing orbit, the Curie will ignite a third time to circularise before deploying the solar sail demonstration spacecraft. The Kick Stage will then ignite Curie a fourth and final time to perform a deorbit burn that returns the Kick Stage closer to Earth, speeding up its eventual deorbit and removal from space to support a more sustainable space environment. Rocket Lab has demonstrated similar orbit raises, inclination changes, and deorbit maneuvers across previous Electron missions and most recently with itssuccessful spacecraft re-entry for Varda on February 21, 2024. ‘Beginning Of The Swarm’ will be Rocket Lab’s fifth mission of 2024 and the 47thElectron launch overall. ‘Beginning Of The Swarm’ details: Launch window: opens no-earlier-than April 24, 2024. Customers: The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and NASA. Satellites: NEONSAT-1 for SaTReC/KAIST and the Advanced Composite Solar Sail System (ACS3) for NASA.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/viasat-rocket-lab-partner-showcase-130700387.html,"Viasat selected Rocket Lab to support its NASA CSP program demonstrations of multi-band space-relay capabilities CARLSBAD, Calif. & LONG BEACH, Calif., March 07, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Viasat Inc.(NASDAQ: VSAT), a global leader in satellite communications, today announced it selected Rocket Lab USA, Inc (Nasdaq: RKLB), a leading launch and space systems company, to support Viasat’s hybrid space communications networks demonstrations by producing a spacecraft bus and providing mission operation support. The demonstrations will make evident Viasat’s portfolio of multi-band, space-based relay communication services in support of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space missions with substantial flexibility in managing data, with lower data latency and higher throughput in real time. The demonstrations are part of Viasat’s work across two awards, totaling $80 million, under NASA’s Communications Services Project (CSP), which is evaluating commercial satellite communications services and technologies to support NASA near-Earth communications requirements as it sunsets the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS). LEO satellites typically require direct line-of-sight to a ground station to communicate, introducing significant data latency into the mission operations. Viasat’s Ka- and L-band relay solutions are designed to address this challenge with near real-time, low-data latency communications. The Real-Time Space Relay (RTSR) space-qualified Ka-band terminal will use Viasat’s high-capacity Ka-band network of satellites in geostationary orbit (GEO) to enable LEO operators on-demand access to critical mission data. The InCommand system will use Viasat’s global L-band network to provide real-time telemetry, tracking and command (TT&C) operations at any point in the spacecraft’s orbit. Rocket Lab will also provide a new L-band radio for InCommand called Frontier, which will support demonstrations of various TT&C applications. Scheduled to launch in early 2026, the demonstration mission will also include direct-to-ground communications through Viasat’s Real-Time Earth (RTE) Ground-Station-as-a-Service for S-, X-, and Ka-bands. All transports will be integrated through Viasat’s Integrated Space Access Network (ISAN) to show the benefits of adaptable transport, giving LEO operators the ability to access data while balancing network availability, cost, and time-sensitive applications. ""We are proud to support NASA with this critically needed real-time space relay communications capability and excited about our continuing partnership with Rocket Lab to support Viasat’s growing space missions portfolio,"" said Michael Maughan, Vice President of Space and Mission Systems, Viasat Government Systems. ""From Earth observation and scientific missions to supporting defense operations, we designed our space relay services to be a highly flexible, cost effective and scalable solution for both government and commercial LEO operators to transport data based on application and mission needs."" Rocket Lab Vice President of Space Systems, Brad Clevenger, said: ""Rocket Lab spacecraft are built on configurable, high-performance subsystems based on constellation-class manufacturing. By providing a configurable platform that can be tailored to suit even the most complex missions, our customers can focus on their own novel hardware and services and leave the development and operation of the spacecraft to us. We look forward to supporting Viasat on the NASA CSP mission, as it will also add responsive satellite communications capabilities to our configurable platform."" The Rocket Lab spacecraft will provide the power, communications, propulsion, and attitude control for the mission demonstration. Rocket Lab will incorporate its own satellite components and sub-systems into the spacecraft including star trackers, reaction wheels, solar panels, S-band radios, flight software and ground software, and the new L-band radio in development for the future InCommand service.

https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rocket-lab-why-space-sector-180130298.html,"Rocket Lab (RKLB) will attempt to launch its first ""Neutron"" rocket by the end of 2024. NASA recently tapped Rocket Lab, along with 14 other companies, to aid the space agency with payload integration services on suborbital rockets, high-altitude balloons, and orbital spacecrafts and satellites. Peter Beck, Rocket Lab CEO, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the feasibility of the Neutron rocket launch timeline as well as the space sector's profitable intersection with other industries. Beck elaborates on the growth of the space industry and how companies like Rocket Lab are positioned to deliver far-reaching services: ""We see that businesses that typically haven't had anything to do with space becoming quite reliant on it. And our view [is] that the large, successful space companies of the future are not going to be solely a launch company or solely a satellite manufacturing company because the sheer power when you combine these two elements together, space is a giant engineering compromise, if you will. So if you can both add launch and space systems together, then you can provide services that are far superior than if you're doing it in a more traditional sense. And we've seen more and more companies come to us and they have no knowledge of the space industry nor do they want to, but they just want a service.""

Editor's note: This article was written byNicholas Jacobino AKIKO FUJITA:Rocket Lab shares have had a bit of a difficult start to 2024, down more than 20% so far this year. The space company is looking to make its mark on the industry with the launch of its first Neutron rocket, which it originally unveiled plans of back in 2021. Let's bring in Peter Beck. He is the Rocket Lab CEO. And Peter, it's good to talk to you today. There's so much attention on this Neutron launch, which is, of course, the medium-lift rocket that you're looking to launch by the end of the year. But I want to get your reaction to a report that came out from TechCrunch, which, by the way, is owned by our parent company Apollo as well, sort of suggesting-- they cite an internal congressional memo that said Rocket Lab essentially overstated its ability to be able to deliver on this launch by the end of this year, saying, essentially, December 15 was put as the target date, so you could be eligible for these lucrative contracts that come through from the Space Force. Want to get your reaction to that. How much credence do we put in that and how credible is that launch target, December 15? PETER BECK:Yeah. Well, thanks very much. Look, I think, clearly, we've got the attention of our competitors. And you know, I take that as a feather in our cap that people start throwing mud at you. So look, we're working super hard to try and get the vehicle to the pad by the end of the year. I think everybody knows that. But we're also being realistic that it is a launch vehicle and it's a launch vehicle program. And if everything goes well, we'll get it to the pad. And if we have issues along the way, then we won't. But at the moment we have a schedule that says we can get it to the pad. So until that changes, we're not waving the white flag. AKIKO FUJITA:So let's talk about some of those challenges in getting there. You've highlighted in the most recent earnings call about this new engine that will be used in Neutron. That's, kind of, the next step, getting the test going on that. What does that timeline look like? You mentioned potentially end of March. Is that schedule still on track? PETER BECK:Yeah. Yeah. So you know, engines are typically the long pole in the tent on any new launch vehicle development. We've done everything we can to try and remove the stress out of the engine and the engine program. So we'll look to have something on the test stand hopefully by the end of March. And then that's when the rubber hits the road as we'll see how the engine performs. And we're kind of at that honeymoon phase right now where we have a lot of hardware all coming to fruition, you know. We've completed all our avionics and hardware in the loop and a lot of the software and testing. So now is that time when all that hardware comes together and we get to see what we've really got. AKIKO FUJITA:It's been pretty incredible to see the ramp up in just commercial activity within the space sector. Rocket Lab itself trying to own sort of that full stack from satellite to launch. You've got Electron already really sort of humming along. Neutron, this medium-lift rocket, is next. Other offerings in the works as well. What does the future of Rocket Lab look like? PETER BECK:Yeah, no, it's funny because everybody knows us for our Electron launch vehicle. You know, it's the second most frequently launched rocket behind SpaceX. Fourth most frequently launched rocket in the entire world, in fact. So not surprisingly, everybody knows us for our rocket programs. But actually, 2/3 of our revenue come from our space systems division. And we have over 40 satellites and build some for very important national security missions like the SDA, you know, and some for commercial constellations. Then we have a merchant supply business of space components that is far reaching across the entire industry. In fact, you know, 37% of everything that was launched last year had a Rocket Lab logo on it somewhere. So like I say, we're well known for our rockets, but we pride ourselves on being a one-stop space shop. So we do everything from the initial design and supply of components through to actually building the satellites, through the launching the satellites. And then just yesterday, we had an event for the MethaneSAT where we actually operate that satellite for customers as well. So really an end-to-end space company. AKIKO FUJITA:Peter, you mentioned you have the second most launches behind SpaceX. Last I saw-- I mean SpaceX is launching rockets, what, once every three days or something. If you, kind of, break down the annual number, what's the target for Rocket Lab or how long until you get to that kind of frequency? PETER BECK:Yeah, so Electron this year will launch around about 22 times. So that's a marked step up from last year, which is about 10 times. So we have a rocket on the pad, sort of, every couple of weeks. AKIKO FUJITA:So far, when you look at, sort of, the breakdown of the space industry so much of it has been about rockets and satellite communications. We recently saw the successful re-entry of Varda space capsule, which, of course, Rocket Lab designed. This is a capsule for those who haven't been following that allows for space manufacturing. A lot of that in pharmaceuticals as well. And I wonder, when you think about the future of this industry, does it get to a point where it's not just about being a rocket company, sort of, an aerospace company? That, in other words, pharmaceuticals, health and wellness, everybody will have to somehow participate in it because it is going to be at that intersection. PETER BECK:Yeah, absolutely. And look, we see businesses that typically haven't had anything to do with space becoming quite reliant on it. And our view that the large, successful space companies of the future are not going to be solely a launch company or solely a satellite manufacturing company. Because the sheer power of when you combine those two elements together, I mean space is a giant engineering compromise, if you will. So if you can both add launch and space systems together, then you can provide services that are far superior than if you're doing it in a more traditional sense. And we see more and more companies come to us and they have no knowledge of the space industry nor do they want to. But they just want to serve us and I think that's where it all boils down to. So the reason why we're pushing so hard on Neutron is 50% of it is that, look, we absolutely think there needs to be some more competition in the market in the medium launch area. And secondly, we want to provide services and having your own ride to space or having the keys to space is critical to that. AKIKO FUJITA:Peter Beck, Rocket Lab's CEO, always good to talk to you. Really appreciate you joining us today. PETER BECK:My pleasure. Thanks."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-usa-inc-nasdaq-102814006.html,"As you might know,Rocket Lab USA, Inc.(NASDAQ:RKLB) recently reported its full-year numbers. Rocket Lab USA reported revenues of US$245m, in line with expectations, but it unfortunately also reported (statutory) losses of US$0.38 per share, which were slightly larger than expected. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results. Check out our latest analysis for Rocket Lab USA Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Rocket Lab USA from nine analysts is for revenues of US$427.2m in 2024. If met, it would imply a huge 75% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Losses are expected to increase slightly, to US$0.40 per share. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$423.2m and losses of US$0.32 per share in 2024. While this year's revenue estimates held steady, there was also a sizeable expansion in loss per share expectations, suggesting the consensus has a bit of a mixed view on the stock. As a result, there was no major change to the consensus price target of US$8.10, with the analysts implicitly confirming that the business looks to be performing in line with expectations, despite higher forecast losses. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Rocket Lab USA, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$10.00 and the most bearish at US$6.00 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Rocket Lab USA shareholders. One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the sameindustryare performing. The analysts are definitely expecting Rocket Lab USA's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 75% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 60% per annum over the past three years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 6.5% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Rocket Lab USA is expected to grow much faster than its industry. The most important thing to note is the forecast of increased losses next year, suggesting all may not be well at Rocket Lab USA. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates. Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have estimates - from multiple Rocket Lab USA analysts - going out to 2026, and you cansee them free on our platform here.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-successfully-returns-spacecraft-225300522.html,"The Rocket Lab spacecraft designed, built, and operated for Varda Space Industries which enabled the production of pharmaceutical products on orbit, has been returned to Earth LONG BEACH, Calif., February 21, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or ""the Company""), a leading launch and space systems company, today announced its custom spacecraft for Varda Space Industries (""Varda""), a leading in-space manufacturing and hypersonic reentry logistics company, successfully returned to Earth the world’s first space manufacturing mission conducted outside of the International Space Station. Rocket Lab conducted in-space operations, deorbit, and reentry positioning maneuvers for its spacecraft, enabling Varda’s reentry capsule and payload of pharmaceutical crystals to return to Earth. With Rocket Lab’s role in the mission complete, the Varda team then took over management of the capsule’s hypersonic reentry, parachute deployment, and touchdown in the designated zone at the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) near Salt Lake City shortly after 21:30 UTC today. Today’s mission is a successful demonstration of Rocket Lab’s end-to-end space systems solutions tailored to enable novel and innovative missions for a range of customers. Rocket Lab designed, manufactured and operated a bespoke spacecraft to enable Varda’s capsule manufacturing demonstration. The spacecraft included a full suite of Rocket Lab sub-systems and components built in-house, spanning spacecraft engine, flight software, avionics, reaction wheels, star trackers, capsule dispenser, solar panels, radio, composite structures and tanks, and more. While initially designed for a four-month lifespan on orbit, the mission timeline was more than doubled with Rocket Lab’s spacecraft successfully provided power, communications, ground control, and attitude control to Varda’s capsule on orbit for more than eight months. This enabled Varda’s capsule to grow Ritonavir crystals, commonly used in antiviral medication. As particles function differently when no longer under the force of gravity, Varda’s capsule utilizes microgravity conditions in space to formulate a range of pharmaceutical products. Rocket Lab also supported the mission with 24/7 satellite operations to return Varda’s capsule to Earth. Rocket Lab’s operations team completed multiple on-orbit trajectory optimization maneuvers that set the mission on its return-to-Earth trajectory, including four engine relights of Rocket Lab’s 3D printed Curie propulsion system to move Varda’s mission from a circular Earth orbit to an elliptical one, positioning Varda’s capsule for a return to Earth at hypersonic speeds greater than Mach 25, or approximately 30,000 km per hour. Deploying Varda’s capsule on a hypersonic reentry trajectory to land within the incredibly tight boundaries of the mission’s landing zone within the UTTR was an especially complex task that demanded pinpoint accuracy with a margin of error of less than 0.05%. Varda’s recovery operations are now in full swing and once the capsule is retrieved by Varda, the company will conduct laboratory analysis of the space-grown crystals and determine its next steps for commercializing orbital drug processing and microgravity manufacturing. Peter Beck, Rocket Lab founder and CEO, says: ""This mission was a phenomenal feat and impressive display of teamwork between the Rocket Lab and Varda teams to develop a unique and highly capable spacecraft, successfully demonstrate in-space manufacturing, and bring back the capsule and finished pharmaceutical product – all on the first attempt. Being part of the first pharmaceutical in-space mission to happen outside of the International Space Station is immensely exciting and we look forward to building on this success with more Rocket Lab spacecraft in development for Varda right now. The success of this reentry mission will also inform our work on developing a reentry capsule for Neutron to potentially enable human spaceflight missions."" Today’s returned mission is the first of four Rocket Lab spacecraft ordered by Varda to support its in-space pharmaceutical processing. The remaining spacecraft are currently undergoing assembly, integration, and testing at Rocket Lab’s spacecraft production facility in Long Beach, California, with the next spacecraft scheduled to launch before the end of the year. These spacecraft for Varda are just some of the 25+ spacecraft currently under development at Rocket Lab’s advanced spacecraft development and manufacturing complex, which features a 10,000 sq. ft. cleanroom and 40,000 sq. ft. of production & test facilities designed to support constellation class manufacturing and satellite assembly, integration and test for commercial, civil and national security customers. + About Rocket Lab Founded in 2006, Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-schedules-launch-date-211500225.html,"The mission will be Rocket Lab’s fourth mission for Japanese constellation operator Synspective LONG BEACH, Calif., February 20, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the launch window for its 45thElectron launch, a dedicated mission for Synspective, a Japanese Earth-imaging satellite constellation operator. The ""Owl Night Long"" mission is scheduled to launch during a 14-day window that opens on March 10thNZDT (March 9thUTC). The mission will lift off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand and will deploy a StriX-3 satellite to orbit, continuing a multi-launch agreement to deliver Synspective’s StriX-series satellites to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab has been the exclusive launch provider for Synspective to date and the ""Owl Night Long"" mission will be Rocket Lab’s fourth launch for the constellation operator following launches in 2020 and 2022: The Owls’ Night Begins: Launched December 2020 The Owl’s Night Continues: Launched February 2022 The Owl Spreads its Wings: Launched September 2022 Synspective is a satellite data solutions provider with its own constellation of SAR satellites. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active system that transmits microwave pulses toward the Earth's surface and receives the reflected signals to create an image of the target area. Unlike other imaging technologies, SAR can penetrate clouds and other atmospheric conditions, enabling it to collect data day or night with frequent revisit rates. SAR data contain information that helps to understand the shape and physical properties of terrain and structures. Observing the same target under constant conditions makes it well-suited for time-series analysis and change detection, enabling the capture of ongoing economic and environmental changes. By flying as a dedicated payload on Electron, Synspective has a high degree of control over the launch schedule and orbital deployment parameters. Electron is also an ideal launch vehicle for the StriX constellation due to a unique Synspective deployment requirement. Electron’s Kick Stage performs an advanced mid-mission maneuver to shield the StriX satellite from the sun to reduce radiation exposure ahead of payload deployment, a level of mission customization not available on large rideshare missions. Rocket Lab founder and Chief Executive, Peter Beck, says: ""We’re excited to continue our strong partnership with Synspective having been their sole launch provider to date. Electron delivers a tailored, customized launch service that offers Synspective a rare level of precision deployment to ensure their satellites are placed in perfect orbits on rapid timelines. We look forward to helping another owl take flight and expanding Synspective’s constellation."" Synspective founder and CEO, Dr. Motoyuki Arai, says: ""I am delighted to be able to take on another challenge with the Rocket Lab team, who have led us to launch three satellites into their target orbits successfully. I also want to express my gratitude to the dedicated teams of both companies and everyone involved in the StriX-3 project. StriX-3 is our fourth satellite, enabling us to offer more data services to our new and existing customers. This year, we plan to expand our business through multiple launches, and StriX-3 will be the first satellite aimed at full-scale constellation operations. Through this launch, we will advance our understanding of the manufacturing process, enhance our satellite operation know-how, increase the volume of data supply, and strengthen our data analysis capabilities. To address all sustainable development challenges within our generation, we will push forward our analytics platform business, enabling societal progress through data-driven insights and collective learning.""

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-successfully-launches-mission-172400947.html,"Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket successfully deployed the ADRAS-J satellite for Astroscale Japan Inc to conduct an orbital debris inspection demonstration mission. MAHIA, New Zealand, February 18, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today launched its 44thElectron rocket, successfully deploying an orbital debris inspection satellite for Astroscale Japan Inc. The mission, named ""On Closer Inspection"", launched from Pad B at Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 03:52 NZDT February 19th, 2024 (14:52 UTC, February 18th). Electron deployed the Active Debris Removal by Astroscale-Japan (ADRAS-J), a satellite designed to test technologies and operations for approaching and monitoring debris objects in orbit, also known as space junk. The mission is the first phase in assessing the potential for satellites to rendezvous with orbital debris objects in future and assist in de-orbiting them, supporting space sustainability for future generations. Following the successful launch on Electron, the 150-kilogram ADRAS-J satellite will now approach an aged, derelict rocket stage in orbit to observe it closely, understand how it behaves and determine potential methods for its assisted deorbiting in future. The rocket stage it will be observing is the Japanese H-2A upper stage left in low Earth orbit after the launch of the GOSAT Earth observation satellite in 2009. ADRAS-J will fly around the stage, 11 meters long and four meters in diameter, inspecting it with cameras and sensors. Astroscale’s full mission will take between three and six months to complete. ""Congratulations to the Astroscale team on this historic mission that paves the way for new and innovative ways to reduce orbital debris and ensure space remains safely accessible,"" said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck. ""It’s a real honor to provide a dedicated launch service and enable the kind of precise orbital maneuvers required for an advanced mission like this."" To enable the ADRAS-J satellite to rendezvous with the derelict H-2A upper stage in orbit, Rocket Lab had to design a mission with strict launch timing and precision orbital deployment parameters. Rocket Lab only received the final perigee, apogee, and inclination from Astroscale 20 days before launch, parameters that are typically determined many months in advance of a launch. Only then could argument of perigee targets for different days within the launch window be selected, essentially determining the timing of Electron Kick Stage burns to facilitate the unique elliptical orbit required depending on the launch date. The mission demanded highly accurate orbital insertion with tighter margins than required on most standard missions. The exact T-0 was only able to be defined the day prior to launch and the required LTAN accuracy only allows for +/- 15 seconds, demonstrating Rocket Lab’s capability to deliver rapid and responsive advanced guidance, navigation and control analysis. ""Today’s successful launch of ADRAS-J marks another milestone toward our efforts to grow the on-orbit servicing sector while creating a sustainable space environment,"" said Astroscale founder & CEO Nobu Okada. ""We are grateful for the collaboration with Rocket Lab, whose expertise in dedicated launch services has been instrumental to the start of this ground breaking mission.""

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-sets-launch-window-211500502.html,"The highly responsive mission aims to demonstrate new orbital debris inspection technologies for space sustainability LONG BEACH, Calif., February 07, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has set the launch window for Astroscale’s orbital debris inspection demonstration mission. The ‘On Closer Inspection’ mission is scheduled to launch during a 14-day window that opens on February 19thNZDT. The mission will lift-off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand and will deploy the Active Debris Removal by Astroscale-Japan (ADRAS-J) satellite for Astroscale Japan Inc. The mission is the first phase of an orbital debris removal program, and during this phase ADRAS-J is designed to test technologies and operations for approaching and monitoring debris objects, also known as space junk, and delivering data that will assist in removing it, to ensure the sustainable use of space for future generations. After launching on Electron, the 150-kilogram ADRAS-J satellite will approach an aged, derelict rocket stage in orbit to observe it closely, understand how it behaves and determine potential methods for its assisted deorbiting in future. The rocket stage it will be observing is the Japanese H-2A upper stage left in low Earth orbit after the launch of the GOSAT Earth observation satellite in 2009. ADRAS-J will fly around the stage, 11 meters long and four meters in diameter, inspecting it with cameras. After deployment from Electron, Astroscale’s full mission will take between three and six months to complete. To enable the rendezvous with a non-cooperative space object requires a dedicated launch, highly responsive mission planning and extremely tight margins on orbital parameters. Rocket Lab only received the final perigee, apogee, and inclination from Astroscale 20 days before launch. Only then could argument of perigee targets for different days within the 14-day window be selected, essentially determining the timing of Electron Kick Stage burns to facilitate the unique elliptical orbit required depending on the launch date. The mission also demands highly accurate orbital insertion with tighter margins than required on most standard missions. In addition, the exact T-0 will only be defined the day prior to launch and the required LTAN accuracy only allows for +/- 15 seconds. ""Electron is really the only vehicle capable of delivering such a complex mission on an expedited timeline,"" said Rocket Lab Founder and CEO Peter Beck. ""With a dedicated launch on Electron the Astroscale team have a high degree of control over launch time and deployment parameters, and the Kick Stage delivers critical manoeuvrability for precise orbital deployment. We’re immensely proud to be working with the Astroscale team in support of a pivotal mission that could have real, positive benefits for managing space sustainability for future generations."" ""We are proud to join forces with Rocket Lab to launch the world’s first attempt to safely approach a piece of large debris,"" said Astroscale Founder & CEO, Nobu Okada. ""ADRAS-J is a testament to our commitment to technological innovation and to fostering the growth of the on-orbit servicing sector. This mission holds immense significance, not just for the future of space sustainability, but for pioneering advancements in Rendezvous and Proximity Operations, which are essential technologies to deliver any on-orbit servicing such as debris removal."" ‘On Closer Inspection’ will be Rocket Lab’s 2ndlaunch in 2024 and the 44thElectron mission overall. + About Rocket Lab Founded in 2006, Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-announces-pricing-upsized-030800131.html,"LONG BEACH, Calif., February 02, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (""Rocket Lab"", ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"") (Nasdaq: RKLB), a global leader in launch services and space systems, announced today the pricing of its previously announced private offering of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.250% convertible senior notes due 2029 (the ""notes"") to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). The offering was upsized from the previously announced offering size of $275.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes. In connection with this offering, Rocket Lab granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a period of 13 days from, and including the date the notes are first issued, up to an additional $55.0 million aggregate principal amount of the notes. The offering of the notes is expected to close on February 6, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Rocket Lab and will accrue interest at a rate of 4.250% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2024. The notes will mature on February 1, 2029, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Before November 1, 2028, noteholders will have the right to convert their notes in certain circumstances and during specified periods. From and after November 1, 2028, noteholders may convert their notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. Rocket Lab will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""common stock""), or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at Rocket Lab’s election. The initial conversion rate is 195.1029 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $5.13 per share of common stock. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 27.5% above the last reported sale price of the common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market on February 1, 2024, which was $4.02 per share. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), for cash at Rocket Lab’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after February 1, 2027 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time and certain liquidity conditions have been satisfied. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. Rocket Lab estimates that the net proceeds from the offering of the notes will be approximately $290.2 million (or approximately $343.5 million if the initial purchasers exercise in full their option to purchase additional notes), after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by Rocket Lab. Rocket Lab intends to use approximately $36.5 million of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of entering into the capped call transactions described below. Additionally, Rocket Lab intends to use approximately $40 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of its borrowings under its equipment financing agreement, including accrued and unpaid interest on such borrowings. Rocket Lab intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds for working capital or other general corporate purposes, which may include potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Rocket Lab expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional notes to enter into additional capped call transactions and the remainder of such net proceeds for working capital or other general corporate purposes, which may include potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. From time to time, Rocket Lab evaluates potential strategic transactions and acquisitions of businesses, technologies or products. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the notes, Rocket Lab entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the ""capped call transactions"") with certain financial institutions (the ""option counterparties""). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of common stock that will initially underlie the notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce or offset potential dilution to the common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or at Rocket Lab’s election (subject to certain conditions) offset any potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be $8.04 per share of common stock, which represents a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price of the common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market on February 1, 2024. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Rocket Lab expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. Rocket Lab has been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to purchase shares of common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the common stock and/or purchasing or selling the common stock or other securities of Rocket Lab in secondary market transactions from time to time prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the capped call transactions, which are expected to occur during the 40 trading day period beginning on the 41st scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the notes, or following Rocket Lab’s election to terminate any portion of the capped call transactions in connection with any repurchase, redemption or early conversion of the notes). This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the common stock or the notes, which could affect a noteholder’s ability to convert its notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the number of shares of common stock and/or value of the consideration that a noteholder will receive upon conversion of its notes. The notes were offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The offer and sale of the notes and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, and the notes and any such shares cannot be offered or sold absent registration or except pursuant to an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, the notes or any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, nor will there be any sale of the notes or any such shares, in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, sale or solicitation would be unlawful.

Catch more ofGood Buy or Goodbye here,or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Livehere. Editor's note: This article was written byLuke Carberry Mogan. [MUSIC PLAYING] JULIE HYMAN:It's a big noisy universe of stocks out there. Welcome to Good Buy or Goodbye. Our goal to help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio. Today, we're taking to the skies, looking into space travel and the investment opportunities that may be found in the next frontier of commercial trips. What's the best way to play it now? I'm here with Justus Parmar who's Fortuna Investments CEO. Thanks so much for joining us. JUSTUS PARMAR:Thank you for having me, Julie. Great to be here. JULIE HYMAN:So let's get right to what you're looking at and your good buy stock, the one that you like better. That is Rocket Labs here. And so if we look at the stock over the past year, it's kind of come down from a recent peak. But let's talk about your case here. First of all, it's already had some launches. JUSTUS PARMAR:Yeah, absolutely. And I think we should maybe take one step backwards. JULIE HYMAN:Yeah. JUSTUS PARMAR:And you know, we've had a very difficult and very nasty year in the growth markets for the last 12 to 24 months. So I think everything that's growth related has generally been suppressed. So we're of the opinion that the rates are coming down this year. It's a presidential year. There's all sorts of great activities starting to be formed. So we actually think that the whole sector is going to rise this year because of some of these amazing catalysts that are coming. JULIE HYMAN:Got you. JUSTUS PARMAR:So within that sector, we like a company called Rocket Labs, for example. It is a smaller company. It's only a $2-billion market cap or so. As you could see on the previous slide that the stock had been consolidating around the $4 to $5 range. And to your point, Julie, the company has done over 40 successful space launches. That's very, very, very difficult to do. There's only a handful of companies in the world that have actually been able to do that, SpaceX being the leading candidate. JULIE HYMAN:Right. And then if you look at the forward looking here-- situation here, the company has new contracts as well that investors can look to. JUSTUS PARMAR:Yeah, you bet. They just announced-- about a month ago, they announced a $500-million record contract, an international contract. So a company, again, you don't have to be a mathematician to start adding some of these things up where you're in a depressed space or sector, you've got a company that's been performing really well. I've talked to Peter Beck, the CEO, a number of times. Really, really great, smart entrepreneur starting to strap on massive contracts like these $500-million contracts. There's a lot of potential upside opportunity in something like this. JULIE HYMAN:And to be clear, these are for-- when they take the rockets up, are they putting satellites into space? They're not people riding. This is not sort of tourism, correct? JUSTUS PARMAR:Correct, exactly. So a company like Rocket Labs is taking, as you mentioned, satellites, hardware, payload, non-human things into outer space. There are other companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic who are taking tourists or people like you and I into outer space. JULIE HYMAN:Well, I guess we talked about the new contracts a little bit already here. But when we look at the market share in this industry as well, as we mentioned, Rocket Lab, there's not that many players that are doing this kind of thing. So how does Rocket stack up against some of the other players? JUSTUS PARMAR:Well, I mean-- and that's just it, a lot of companies have tried. Unfortunately, a lot of companies have failed. But again, this is very, very complicated stuff. This is not tourism, or hospitality, or warehouses, or something that's-- I don't want to say more basic. They're taking things into outer space. This is very, very difficult stuff. And so Rocket Labs has emerged as earlier stage-- it's a $2-billion market cap, so it's not $1-trillion company. It's not a Facebook. It's not a Tesla. It's an early speculative company. But if they continue on this trajectory, I think their future is quite bright. JULIE HYMAN:All right, let's talk about the risks as we like to do. And you've sort of alluded to it before that it is a small company and it's expensive to do this stuff. Yes, they're bringing in revenue to your point. But it's expensive to get these rockets into space and they're not very large. JUSTUS PARMAR:You bet. And so they're-- from everything we can gather, they're not a profitable company as of yet. They're striving to be kind to cash flow break even from our best estimates. They spend a lot of money in research and development. They're going on to a new rocket in this coming year. So they've got a smaller rocket with a smaller capsule and they want to be a mid-range player. So they're going to be spending a lot of money in research and development into developing this mid-range rocket. And so any time you're jumping up a class there is inherently execution risk in some of this. And so ultimately, from my perspective at least, the biggest risks are Peter Beck and the team being able to execute these very, very complicated challenging things. JULIE HYMAN:Got you. And just to be clear for disclosure purposes, do you own Rocket Lab? JUSTUS PARMAR:No, we don't. We do not own Rocket Labs. JULIE HYMAN:All right, let's get to the one that you do not like and this is Virgin Galactic. This chart is a little bit different here. It's gone quite down over the past year. Better sort of no name probably in the space here, but let's get into why you don't like it. Basically, you're saying here not necessarily economically viable, the model that exists for this one JUSTUS PARMAR:That's right. And just to be clear, we're not haters. We're extremely bullish of the entire space industry and sector. We've got multiple investments in different areas of the field. But when you look at a company like Virgin Galactic-- and by the way. I'm a huge Richard Branson fan. He's been a great entrepreneur. He's done tremendously well in records, and cruise lines, and airlines, and all sorts of amazing things. But this particular company to date, they've had a lot of serious challenges. They've gone through over $1 billion in capital. They've had a technology that's been really challenging to integrate. And currently, they've actually just recently, as of last week, they've launched their 11th successful spaceflight. So what that means is they've actually got humans like you and I into outer space 11 times successfully, which is remarkable. That's really, really exciting. So there is some really, really good stuff in there, but there's also some stuff that's seriously challenged. JULIE HYMAN:Well, I mean 11 is great, but you also pointed out in your notes that's difficult to scale, right? If you look at the sort of cost per passenger and revenue per passenger with these relatively small flights into space, they're not going to make money unless you can make a much bigger rocket, for example, or maybe fly a lot more missions. JUSTUS PARMAR:That's just it. And so when you run the back of the envelope calculations, right, so each rocket's got eight seats. And so their last price sheet is it's $250,000 or a quarter million dollars per head to go to outer space. Expensive but not a terribly bad deal in a certain capacity. And so they've got eight seats on the rocket. Let's assume they're able to do one a month, which they haven't been able to do yet. And so 250 times 8 is $2 million. $2 million times 12 months is $24 million. So their revenue profile currently, if they do one a month, is $24 million, which might sound like a lot of money. But then when you look at their balance sheet and the financial statements, they're losing almost $200 million a quarter. JULIE HYMAN:Right. JUSTUS PARMAR:And so there's a big discrepancy there unfortunately. JULIE HYMAN:And they're trying to raise money through selling more shares. So then that dilutes the value for existing shareholders. JUSTUS PARMAR:That's exactly it. So even their last financing, it wasn't a traditional Goldman Sachs financing. It was something called an ATM, At The Market. And what that means is the company will actually issue shares from Treasury and fulfill the demand in the marketplace. So effectively, it actually caps the stock in a certain way. And so when you actually look at the company and you really look at it, they've got $1.1 billion in assets on their balance sheet-- sorry, liquid assets, so cash and cash equivalents. Their market cap, if you pull them up, they're only about a $800 million valued company. So they have more cash than their actual total market cap. So they're actually minus $200 worth of value. And that gives you, I guess, maybe an idea of how the Street or investors are viewing this at this current time. JULIE HYMAN:OK, just like we looked at the risk to the upside for Rocket, risks to the downside here that they would you know slash costs perhaps and make it happen for them. JUSTUS PARMAR:Yeah, so I think they've been trying to slash costs, especially over this last quarter here. They've still got a tremendously long way to go on that. But I think the bigger elephant in the room in a certain way is actually the fact that we just-- or the point that we just talked about, which is economically, it's going to be really hard to crank a lot of revenue in that current eight-seat rocket. And so even those eight seats, they've actually been comping some of them for celebrities and different people like that. So they're actually not even doing the $2 million per head. So they're inherently-- much like the Rocket Labs example, they're inherently going to have to make a brand new rocket and capsule to really start to carry more passengers and make it more economical. And so the good news is they have a $1 billion or $1.1 billion to do it and a bit of a runway. But again, I guess the topic or the bumper sticker is this is very, very challenging stuff. And so-- JULIE HYMAN:Got you. JUSTUS PARMAR:--we'll see how it shakes out. JULIE HYMAN:All right, well, Justus, thanks so much. Let's summarize what you've talked about here. You say by Rocket Lab based on the company's success so far, the potential for growth, a lot of new contracts. On the other side, you say avoid Virgin Galactic given the slowing-- the economic viability there and the current positioning of the stock Thank you so much, Justus. Appreciate it, Justus Parmar. And thanks to you for watching. Goodbye or Goodbye. We're going to be bringing you new episodes three times a week at 3:30 PM Eastern. We'll be right back."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-announces-proposed-offering-212000293.html,"LONG BEACH, Calif., January 31, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (""Rocket Lab"", ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"") (Nasdaq: RKLB), a global leader in launch services and space systems, announced today that it has commenced a private offering of $275.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2029 (the ""notes"") to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). In connection with this offering, Rocket Lab expects to grant the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a period of 13 days from, and including the date the notes are first issued, up to an additional $41.25 million aggregate principal amount of the notes. The offering of the notes is subject to market and other conditions and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering may be completed, or as to the actual size or terms of the offering. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Rocket Lab, will accrue interest payable semi-annually in arrears and will mature on February 1, 2029, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Noteholders will have the right to convert their notes in certain circumstances and during specified periods. Rocket Lab will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""common stock""), or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at Rocket Lab’s election. The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), for cash at Rocket Lab’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after February 1, 2027 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time and certain liquidity conditions have been satisfied. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the notes will be determined at the pricing of the offering. Rocket Lab intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of entering into the capped call transactions described below. Additionally, Rocket Lab intends to use approximately $40 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of its borrowings under its equipment financing agreement, including accrued and unpaid interest on such borrowings. Rocket Lab intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds for working capital or other general corporate purposes, which may include potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Rocket Lab expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional notes to enter into additional capped call transactions and the remainder of such net proceeds for working capital or other general corporate purposes, which may include potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. From time to time, Rocket Lab evaluates potential strategic transactions and acquisitions of businesses, technologies or products. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the notes, Rocket Lab expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the ""capped call transactions"") with one or more of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the ""option counterparties""). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of common stock that will initially underlie the notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce or offset potential dilution to the common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or at Rocket Lab’s election (subject to certain conditions) offset any potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Rocket Lab expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. Rocket Lab has been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to purchase shares of common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the common stock and/or purchasing or selling the common stock or other securities of Rocket Lab in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and from time to time prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the capped call transactions, which are expected to occur during the 40 trading day period beginning on the 41st scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the notes, or following Rocket Lab’s election to terminate any portion of the capped call transactions in connection with any repurchase, redemption or early conversion of the notes). This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the common stock or the notes, which could affect a noteholder’s ability to convert its notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the number of shares of common stock and/or value of the consideration that a noteholder will receive upon conversion of its notes. The notes will be offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The offer and sale of the notes and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, and the notes and any such shares cannot be offered or sold absent registration or except pursuant to an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, the notes or any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, nor will there be any sale of the notes or any such shares, in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, sale or solicitation would be unlawful.

We are also encouraged by progress made against key Neutron development milestones and look forward to introducing new medium lift launch technical capabilities and much needed incremental capacity to the market."" Certain Estimated Preliminary Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 (unaudited) Our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 are not yet available; however, certain of our estimated preliminary unaudited financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2023 are set forth below. With respect to certain presented results, we have provided ranges, rather than specific amounts, because these results are preliminary and subject to change. These results are based on the information available to us as of the date of this release. Our actual results may vary from the estimated preliminary results presented below, including due to the completion of our financial closing and other operational procedures, final adjustments, and other developments that may arise between now and the time the Company releases its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, which is currently scheduled for February 27, 2024. Our fourth quarter revenue was impacted by the postponement of an Electron launch previously scheduled to occur before the end of 2023, which was partially offset by strength in our Space Systems business. The postponement is not expected to impact our future results. These estimates should not be viewed as a substitute for our full interim or annual financial statements prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on this preliminary data. The estimated preliminary financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2023 have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, management. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the estimated preliminary financial results. Accordingly, our independent registered public accounting firm does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. Certain monetary amounts, percentages, and other figures included below have been subject to rounding adjustments. Percentage amounts included below have not in all cases been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures, but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts below may vary from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in our consolidated financial statements. Certain other amounts that appear below may not sum due to rounding.

We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under GAAP with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information presented excludes certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into our ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following tables present a reconciliation of our estimated preliminary Adjusted EBITDA loss, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023 to the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Such items are excluded from net income or loss to determine Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes this measure provides investors meaningful insight into results from ongoing operations. Non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating expenses further exclude items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Such items are excluded from the applicable GAAP financial measure. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors meaningful insight into results from ongoing operations.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-successfully-launches-first-083700696.html,"The ‘Four Of A Kind’ mission also included a successful splashdown of Electron’s first stage from the ocean after launch, furthering Rocket Lab’s efforts to make Electronthe world’s first reusable small orbital rocket. MAHIA, New Zealand, January 31, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today launched its first Electron mission for 2024, a space-junk focused mission for Spire Global, Inc (""Spire"") and NorthStar Earth & Space (""NorthStar""). The ‘Four Of A Kind’ mission for Spire’s customer NorthStar successfully launched from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 19:34 NZDT / 06:34 UTC. Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket deployed four Space Situational Awareness (SSA) satellites to a 530km circular Earth orbit where the satellites, built and operated by Spire, will monitor near-Earth objects from space to provide timely and precise information for space object detection, tracking, orbit determination, collision avoidance, navigation, and proximity alerts. The mission was Rocket Lab’s 43rd Electron launch overall, bringing the Company’s record of successfully deployed satellites to 176. The mission was the first of a busy launch year for Rocket Lab, with the Company scheduled to launch more in 2024 than any previous year since the Company began missions in 2017. The mission also resulted in the successful return of the rocket’s first stage after launch as part of Rocket Lab’s plan to evolve Electron into a reusable rocket. After launch and stage separation, Electron’s booster made its way back to Earth under a parachute and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean at approximately 17 minutes post lift-off. Rocket Lab’s recovery operations are currently underway to retrieve the stage and bring it back to the Company’s production complex for a post-launch review and analysis before proceeding to one of the program’s final tasks: reusing a previously-launched first stage on a future mission. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Peter Beck, says: ""The success of today’s mission to deliver Spire & NorthStar to orbit, and the completion of our secondary mission to return Electron to Earth after launch, has been a fantastic start of what is set to be Rocket Lab’s busiest year ever. We have more missions booked in 2024 than we’ve ever scheduled before, and it is a real privilege to continue to deliver small launch reliability for our satellite customers on advanced missions like these and for all the missions to come in 2024."" ‘Four Of A Kind’ is Rocket Lab’s first Electron launch in a sold-out 2024 mission manifest that includes multiple upcoming launches for NASA; hypersonic technology tests on suborbital HASTE missions from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 in Virginia; the beginning or continuation of block launches for satellite operators BlackSky, Synspective, and Kineis; and several other launches for commercial and defense sector mission partners. + About Rocket Lab Founded in 2006, Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-lab-launch-space-situational-211000523.html,"Rocket Lab will also attempt to recover Electron’s first stage from the mission in next step for reusability. LONG BEACH, Calif., January 08, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has set the launch window for its first mission of 2024. The ‘Four of a Kind’ mission is scheduled to launch no earlier than January 18 between 19:15-20:00 NZT (January 18 between 06:15-07:00 UTC) from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand. The mission will deploy four Space Situational Awareness (SSA) satellites forSpire Global, Inc’s(Spire) customerNorthStar Earth & Space (NorthStar). NorthStar´s satellites, built and operated by Spire, will be the first to simultaneously monitor all near-Earth orbits from space, delivering a radically enhanced level of SSA services to the global satellite community, with timely and precise information for space object detection, tracking, orbit determination, collision avoidance, navigation, and proximity alerts. As a secondary mission, Rocket Lab will be attempting to splash down and retrieve Electron’s first stage as part of the Company’s plan to evolve Electron into a reusable rocket. After launch and stage separation, Electron’s first stage will return to Earth under a parachute and splash down in the Pacific Ocean several hundred kilometers down range from Launch Complex 1. Rocket Lab’s recovery vessel will extract the stage from the water for transportation back to Rocket Lab’s production complex where it will undergo detailed analysis. Rocket Lab is not launching any pre-flown engines as part of this mission. ""With each recovery mission we iterate toward Electron reusability and with recent launches we’ve made significant leaps forward with more successful splashdowns, recoveries and the first launch of a pre-flown Rutherford engine,"" said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck. ""We’re looking forward to putting advanced heat-shielding and waterproofing systems to the test on this mission as one of the final steps before re-flying an entire first stage. To launch an advanced mission like this with Spire as a mission partner is a real privilege, as they were on our very first orbital mission in 2018. To be partnered up again and both still pushing boundaries with new technology and capabilities all these years later is a great full circle moment."" Spire Global co-founder and CEO, Peter Platzer, says: ""As we approach the launch of NorthStar's SSA satellites, this moment not only signifies a technological milestone but also underscores the meticulous collaboration that has shaped this mission. Through our joint efforts with Rocket Lab, we've been able to offer the flexibility of a dedicated launch tailored precisely to NorthStar's mission requirements. In tandem, Spire's Space Services team, working closely with Rocket Lab, has played a pivotal role in constructing and customizing all mission components, ensuring seamless alignment with NorthStar's unique needs. This collaboration is a testament to our commitment to removing barriers in space business and contributing to a more sustainable future in space."" ‘Four of a Kind’ will be Rocket Lab’s first launch as part of a sold-out launch manifest for 2024 and will be the Company’s 43rdElectron mission overall. + About Rocket Lab Founded in 2006, Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success.

https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rocket-lab-coinbase-bristol-myers-204454310.html,"Karuna Therapeutics (KRTX) shares jump in late trading after news that the company will be acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) for $14 billion, which is $330 per share in cash. Rocket Lab (RKLB) shares soar as the company won a $515 million contract with the United States government, to manufacture, deliver, and operate eighteen space vehicles. Coinbase (COIN) shares are up in late trading as Citizens JMP Securities almost doubles its price target on the stock, raising it from $107 to $200. Yahoo Finance’sJosh LiptonandJared Blikretake a look at some of the trending tickers of the day. For more expert insight and the latest market action, clickhereto watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live. JOSH LIPTON:Now let's get to some trending tickers in today's trade. First up, shares of Karuna Therapeutics. They are surging today. That's after announcing Bristol-Myers will acquire the drug developer for $14 billion. Shares of Bristol-Myers edging higher here. So that's the headline here, Jared. Bristol-Myers agreeing to buy Karuna, $14 billion. That's $330 a share in cash. Karuna, a schizophrenia drug developer company, apparently expecting a decision from the FDA there by September 2024. Reports noting this drug could generate as much as $4 billion by 2020. And the transaction, it sounds like, expected to close the first half of next year. JARED BLIKRE:Yeah, I do have some commentary by TheStreet on this deal-- Cantor, which rates the stock a buy-- or neutral, actually, with a price target of 55, says the deal is, quote, ""absolutely a step in the right direction."" And it fuels the neurology as a growth pillar narrative that BMI has been pushing. Also, one more, by Mizuho, rates KRTX a buy-- price target 245-- seeing the deal receiving less regulatory scrutiny and more easily received FTC approval. Here's a quote. ""Given current scarcity value of high-profile, high-revenue potential, derisked assets such as KRTX, we wouldn't rule out the possibility that bidders could emerge."" So more M&A in this space. It's been kind of a dearth this year. And we're going to be talking more about that with some of the guests. But we want to move on to shares of Rocket Lab. They're taking off today after winning a $515 million US government contract. Under the agreement, Rocket Lab will manufacture, deliver, and operate 18 space vehicles. And I do have some commentary on this as well. Let me just find this in my notes here. There we go. Here's Citi. It rates the stock at neutral, price target of $5.25. Says he believes the contract is for a communications mission, given the cost per satellite and Rocket Labs' expertise in the area, saying it looks like a firm, fixed price award with some level of developmental work, and also likes the related-- related to that is the integration of the payload. So lots of space themes going on here with this company. JOSH LIPTON:Yeah. And by the way, unlike Bristol-Myers, by the way, which even though it's down about 30% this year, most in the name are still on the sidelines. Analysts are fans of this one, Jared. You have 80% who cover this name say you should buy it. And here's your bullish take from the team at Stifel, by the way, on this new contract we're talking about. They called it meaningful. They told their clients they have-- just basically having a separate subsidiary equipped to handle national security programs means, in their opinion, the company is creating differentiation, driving value in a market, they say, poised to grow, given just the increased needs of the US government. Stifel has a buy on this one. Price target is 10. JARED BLIKRE:All right. And actually let's go to the YFi Interactive real quick here. I just want to pull up Rocket Lab and do a little technical analysis. This is from the beginning here. And you can see, this was a SPAC that came to market at about $10 a share. So it's about trading a half of that right now. And $5 has been a floor. And we've seen a little bit of lift-off here. But it's been rough. And taken as a whole SPACs, well, that entire group seemed to have died off in 2022 during that nasty bear market. So not a surprise there. But if you look at the year to date, it looks like it's improving quite a bit. JOSH LIPTON:Yeah, with today's gain, nice jump. And finally, let's check out Coinbase here, climbing today. After a bullish call from JMP, the firm nearly doubling its price target for Coinbase to $200 from $107. So that's the move. This is JMP's Devin Ryan telling his clients at Coinbase-- he actually he told them, it actually reminds him of Amazon, Jared, because Coinbase like Amazon, he says, skating, in his opinion, to where the puck is going. Raises target-- this is a big one-- from 107 to 200. So a nice big move there. Of course, Coinbase has enjoyed this staggering run this year. It's up about 400%. That's as, obviously, Bitcoin rebounding on a bet that Gary Gensler and his team at the SEC are going to green-light a spot Bitcoin ETF. Ryan says he doesn't expect a smooth performance for the industry or the stock. But the industry is here to stay, he says, and will be much larger over the next 10 years, with Coinbase, he argues, continuing to operate at the forefront. JARED BLIKRE:I'll tell you what. Let's go to the YFi Interactive here. And I'm going to chart Coinbase from the IPO. We started out high with huge expectations. And the IPO managed to talk to-- or excuse me-- top tick Bitcoin itself in the entire crypto market. And it was down in 2022 quite a bit of course. We had all the bankruptcies. But Coinbase, for me, has been a story about SEC regulation. They've gone head to head, toe to toe with the SEC. We're not doing very well in '21-- 2021 and 2022-- a couple of missteps there. But it seems like Gary Gensler now and the SEC is kind of on the back foot. And lots of optimism for crypto. And this is the time that institutions-- it seems real this time, as opposed to before when blockchain was just kind of undeveloped and DeFi had to go through its growing pains. It seems like this next leg up could be the final institutionalization of Coinbase and crypto that everybody's been waiting for. JOSH LIPTON:Now, what will be interesting is let's say if and when Gensler green-lights that spot Bitcoin ETF, is that-- is that a positive catalyst that moves us-- the space higher? Or have we talked about it so much-- JARED BLIKRE:Sell the news. JOSH LIPTON:Sell the news. JARED BLIKRE:Yeah, it could be either way. I think the fundamentals of Bitcoin and crypto itself are going to be enough to overcome any sell the news. That's just a personal opinion."

BRAD SMITH:Rocket Lab shares, they are taking off after the aerospace manufacturer entered a $515 million deal here with a US government customer to design and operate 18 space vehicles. Under the contract, Rocket Lab is going to deliver its space vehicles to the customer for a launch slated in 2027 and operate satellites through 2023 here. They said that work under the agreement is going to begin, and as we mentioned, slated for 2027. And then ultimately here, the incentives, the options, base amount of $489 million is what's, kind of, encapsulated within that $515 million, kind of, headline deal price here. SEANA SMITH:Yeah, certainly, the Street seeing it as a catalyst here for shares in the short term. And also, obviously it makes sense for a longer term play as well. Citi is also very encouraged by this, the fact that they did win a $515 million US government contract. Citi making the argument that this more than doubles the backlog for its space systems business. And we know we were just talking about Rocket Lab last week, the fact that it was able to successfully launch its first electron rocket. Since the failure that they did see in September, we saw a lot of excitement surrounding that initially. Once again to end the week, we're seeing some excitement in the shares on the heels of this government contract. Obviously, a huge win here for the company and what it could mean in some of those future deals that could be coming their way. BRAD SMITH:I mean, the government contracts are massive, especially for any of the companies, whether publicly traded or privately held in the space, if you will. Look no further than SpaceX, which has been able to make sure that its business sees the necessary amount of revenues to be able to operate based on government contracts that it's been able to see. That's ultimately catapulted to a hectic corn type of valuation. Mythical creatures will debate them later on. But at the end of the day, for SpaceX, for Rocket Labs, even for some of the other publicly traded entities, such as Lockheed Martin, they've all consistently had to rely on some of these major government contracts. Rocket Lab catching a bit here from one United States, at least division, government customer here."
