While the company rivalsMusk's SpaceX,Beck previously told BIhe has no intention of colonizing Mars.Instead, Rocket Lab focuses on building and managing rockets and satellites.""Rocket Lab will never have the capital that Jeff and Elon have,"" Becktold Bloomberg News in an interview. ""But all that means is you have to be a bit better at hustling, a little bit better at being innovative. You can't break the laws of physics no matter how much capital you've got.""AdvertisementCaution vs fearBeck believes that his paranoia and micromanaging have helped his career.Related storiesIn the short term, paranoia and a hyper-vigilant mindset can drive exceptional results, Edel Holliday-Quinn, a business psychologist who has worked in senior roles at Citi and PwC, told BI, especially in high-stakes industries like aerospace.Breese Annable, a licensed clinical psychologist and career coach who has worked with many high-achieving professionals, also told BI that some level of alertness can be valuable for leaders.Advertisement""Anticipating challenges and planning for contingencies are facets of strategic thinking,"" she said.

""Wanting to do good work is a fine goal. But if paranoia is at the heart of it, you are working to inhibit yourself rather than improve.""AdvertisementThere's a difference between exercising caution and being immobilized withfear of failure, Lamb added.""Realistic caution is the practice of thinking about the future, having contingency plans, and being mindful of all of the hurdles we face,"" she said. ""But it's about managing those worries in a way that won't overwhelm you.""Negative impacts are individual and workplace-wideSleep deprivationsignificantly affects cognitive functioning, decision-making, and emotional regulation, Annable said, and if it is experienced long-term,it has been linked tohigher risks ofcardiovascular diseaseand weakened immune function.AdvertisementChronic stresscan also have physiological effects by contributing to chronic illnesseslike high blood pressure.And it's not just the individual who is affected.Worrying too much about the future can have a lasting impact on the workforce as well.AdvertisementLeaders who are on edge and driven by failure are likely to be micromanagers, Holliday-Quinn said, which can create a toxic workplace culture.""Research consistently shows that employees under micromanagers experience lower job satisfaction, decreased engagement, and higher turnover rates,"" Annable said. ""This creates a ripple effect that can undermine long-term organizational success.""Over time, this can lead tohigh turnoverand low employee happiness.Advertisement""Employees may feel disempowered, undervalued, and overly scrutinized,"" she said.

Yet, a group of U.S. students at USC’s Rocket Propulsion Lab (RPL) has achieved something truly extraordinary—a reminder that groundbreaking work doesn’t always require government budgets. On October 20, their homemade rocket,Aftershock II, soared to an altitude of 470,000 feet, smashing the amateur spaceflight altitude and speed records held for over two decades. Intrigued?Check out the full article here.The 14-foot, 330-pound rocket broke the sound barrier within two seconds, reaching hypersonic speeds of Mach 5.5—around 3,600 mph. ButAftershock IIdidn’t just go fast; it climbed higher than any amateur spacecraft ever before, surpassing the 2004GoFastrocket’s record by 90,000 feet. Even NASA-level challenges like thermal protection at hypersonic speeds were tackled using clever tricks. Titanium-coated fins, specially engineered heat-resistant paint, and a custom telemetry module ensured the rocket not only flew but returned largely intact.This achievement feels straight out of a Commander Keen adventure—scrappy explorers, daring designs, and groundbreaking success against all odds. Thefull storyis a must-read for anyone dreaming of building their own rocket.Posted inNews,SpaceTaggedAftershock II,Black Rock Desert,home made rocket,Nevada,record,rocket,RPL,spaceflight,student madePost navigation←Hackaday Links: November 24, 2024Programmable Zener Is Really An IC→40 thoughts on “Aftershock II: How Students Shattered 20-Year Amateur Rocket Records”The Commenter Formerly Known As Rensays:November 24, 2024 at 7:46 pmAs the link shows for our SI friends, that is 27,400 meters.Report commentReplyPhillsays:November 24, 2024 at 8:00 pm27,400 meters above the previous record for a total of 143km (470,000 feet)Report commentReplydelrysays:November 25, 2024 at 4:46 ampowyżej linii CarmanaReport commentReplyOwlmansays:November 24, 2024 at 8:19 pmThat was how much it beat the previous record, the total height was 143,256 metres.Report commentReplyConsiderationsays:November 24, 2024 at 10:41 pmI understand that HaD is based in the US, but I wonder what the percentage of readers from SI countries is. They should know…Report commentReplyTGsays:November 25, 2024 at 10:38 amI’m based in the US and use both metric and imperial fluently, metric is just too tempting for ease of use when you’re doing a lot of building and measuring. Or working on a imported machine. It’s funny, when I go to Europe and mention things in SI they say they have no idea what that means and ask me for the metric, and they expect I am the same way about their system, but many Americans who build things are fully accustomed to bothReport commentReplyEl Grusays:November 26, 2024 at 12:10 amWe all love Slovenia, but why would their readership matter?;-)Report commentReplyHephaixsays:November 25, 2024 at 2:44 amEven though I don’t particularly like imperial units as a European, aircraft altitude is usually expressed in feet, specifically in hundreds of feet. This rocket reached FL4700, far above the usual FL500 where aircraft typically cruise.Report commentReplyTGsays:November 25, 2024 at 10:36 amThey should really implement a feature on the site where when you hover over a measurement it auto-converts it to either the SI or metric alternative.. Just an idea.Also if it’s 470,000 feet you may as well say 89 miles or 143 kilometers. It’s a bit like measuring architecture in millimeters at that point. Definitely broke the Karman line easilyReport commentReplyCharles Springersays:November 25, 2024 at 8:13 pmOr HaD readers should be able to do it instinctively. It isn’t hard to remember a couple simple ratios. (It would be nice if people quit calling American Customary and ANSI values “imperial”. They are not the same.)Report commentReplyDronesays:November 24, 2024 at 9:16 pmThe now dysfunctional U.S. Military needs this Aftershock II hypersonic missle built by undergraduate students at USC more than anyone! Crate it up then call them and tell them where to pick it up.Report commentReplymoebsays:November 25, 2024 at 12:32 amPlease, I beg you! “hypersonic” is one of the most misused words of the decade… >.<Report commentReplyJohnsays:November 25, 2024 at 3:17 amComing soon to a Northrup Grumman dealer near you, the all new hypersonic blockchain ai quantum defense system, with 33.3% more synergyReport commentReplyThe Commenter Formerly Known As Rensays:November 25, 2024 at 7:08 amB^)Report commentReplyphuzzsays:November 26, 2024 at 2:45 amWhen it comes to funding, AI is the new blockchain, just FYI ;)Report commentReplyDronesays:November 25, 2024 at 8:37 am@moeb said: “Please, I beg you! “hypersonic” is one of the most misused words of the decade…”“The 14-foot, 330-pound rocket broke the sound barrier within two seconds, reaching hypersonic speeds of Mach 5.5—around 3,600 mph.”Misused word? Where?Report commentReplyTGsays:November 25, 2024 at 10:42 amYeah but this rocket is actually capable of it, so it should bear the title in order to combat the many inappropriate uses of the word. Although I wonder if it reaches that speed in atmosphere, or if it is measured after it breaks the Karman line.. “hypersonic” wouldn’t apply in a soundless vacuum, and moreover there isn’t anything up there which doesn’t move at those speeds…Report commentReplymoebsays:November 25, 2024 at 12:35 amPlease, I beg you! “hypersonic” is probably the most misused word of the century and does not apply at all here…Report commentReplyBradsays:November 25, 2024 at 6:22 amWikipedia has “hypersonic” as more than Mach 5. This rocket hit Mach 5.5. How does it not apply?Report commentReplyMaavesays:November 25, 2024 at 9:56 amYes it’s “hypersonic”. No it’s not the kind of “hypersonic” that militaries are talking about. Hypersonic in a mil context refers to air breathing cruise missiles or glide vehicles, something which does not follow a ballistic trajectory. It implies “difficult to detect and intercept”. Ballistic missiles aren’t referred to as hypersonic. Minuteman III reaches Mach 23 but it’s simply an ICBM.Report commentReplyTGsays:November 25, 2024 at 10:45 amAh, those are good points. An ICBM is clearly “hypersonic” if we simply measure its speed during re-entry, but wouldn’t be labeled such because “ballistic” is already plenty descriptive. If you’re going for military application, hypersonic is only a helpful distinction if it can reach those speeds inside a thick atmosphere and maneuver as wellReport commentMaavesays:November 26, 2024 at 6:15 amOh yeah good point about re-entry. That “Mach 23” is going down, the Aftershock II going hypersonic straight up is really impressive.Report commentSteven Naslundsays:November 26, 2024 at 11:41 pmYep, thats correct.  People talk about hypersonics as an invincible military technology but the real deal is maneuvering at hypersonic speeds at low levels.  As we have seen in the Ukraine, straight line hypersonics are easily to defend against by most modern air defense systems because their intercept points are easily computed.  A computer doesnt care if you are at mach 2 or mach 10,  it is just computing an intercept point.  In this article hypersonic is correct, it is just that people have applied some kind of super technology to the word hypersonic.  Every orbital and most suborbital trajectories are hypersonic.Report commentabjqsays:November 26, 2024 at 7:58 amAre you talking hyperbollocks?Report commentReplyChris Fentonsays:November 25, 2024 at 4:04 amThat’s awesome! I worked on the telemetry module for one of RPL’s first launches back in 2006-2007, and it got featured here a few years later:https://hackaday.com/2011/02/20/blasting-off-with-gps/Report commentReplyAntron Argaivsays:November 25, 2024 at 4:31 amI’ll just mention that von Braun got his start in an amateur rocket club.Well done, these people. A very impressive accomplishment.Report commentReplyHammarbytpsays:November 25, 2024 at 7:53 amThat is not the positive you think it is….Report commentReplyTitus431says:November 25, 2024 at 8:31 amBut but, there are songs devoted to him …“Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down?That’s not my department, ” says Wernher von Braun.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QEJ9HrZq7RoReport commentReplyTGsays:November 25, 2024 at 10:46 amYes it absolutely is. So he also made a few missiles a hundred years ago, when everyone was bombing everything from every direction anyway. So what. I’m sick of this grovelling in the dirt, no more of thisReport commentReplyhammarbytpsays:November 25, 2024 at 1:20 pmYes he was just a poor misunderstood soul, who just wanted to play rockets. Lets ignore the slave labour that he used to put them together.Is this where we are, good guys on both sides…?Report commentReplyTGsays:November 26, 2024 at 6:47 amYes. There actually were good people in Germany. I hate to break this to you but your view of history and humanity is childish. And you live off slave labor right now, despite your sanctimony.Report commentThe Commenter Formerly Known As Rensays:November 26, 2024 at 9:17 amI recently heard the story of a young Czechoslovakian man who was good in Physics and “recruited” by the Nazis to work with Werner von Braun.  Opposed to Hitler’s government, he sabotaged some of the experiments he was tasked to do.  His “work” was discovered, and he was shot.Report commentTadpolesays:November 25, 2024 at 6:17 amKnowledge and technology is spreading fast. I sure hope we all can get our collective ideals on some sort of convergent path, because videos like this make me think, “GREAT!” and “OH NO!” at almost the same time.Report commentReplyTGsays:November 25, 2024 at 10:49 am…So you think amateur rocketry is impressive yet too scary, and that there should be some massive global centralization of authority to overlook all of it and every tinkerer should be beholden to it. No thanks, that would stifle everything. We don’t need the entire universe to be the EUReport commentReplyJectsays:November 25, 2024 at 6:35 amReally cool achievement, but I hate tech stories with no details. What was the heat resistant paint that they used? Where the fins metal with titanium nitride coating, or what?Report commentReplyThe Commenter Formerly Known As Rensays:November 25, 2024 at 7:12 amAt least you now know what was accomplished and by whom!Further information regarding this rocket 🚀  is left as an exercise for the student.B^)Report commentReplyTGsays:November 25, 2024 at 10:52 amI did enjoy the tiny detail that they sent the rocket up with silver fins but they came back down blue, due to thermal anodization of the titanium coating. Does that happen with titanium nitride? I don’t know my titanium metallurgy very well.Report commentReplySteven Naslundsays:November 26, 2024 at 11:59 pmPretty sure the paint would be an ablative coating.  Titanium in an obvious choice for something that needs strength at high heat in aerospace.  SR71 was one of the first aircraft to use titanium structures due to the high speeds and heating.  Titanium fins were most likely SLS 3D printed for something like this. That is probably easier than attaching a titanium coating because such a thin titanium nitride layer would still conduct a lot of heat to the base material.  Just educated guesses but there might be an academic paper to accompany this project.Good work but probably nothing groundbreaking since solid fuel rockets and titanium manufacturing are pretty well known.  Students yes but with USC rocket labs it is probably not too much of a stretch and not exactly what I would call “amateur rocketry”.Report commentReplyPaulsays:November 25, 2024 at 11:46 amWait, what?  Mach 5.5 on a single solid fuel stage, including gravity loss and atmospheric drag?  Impressive.Looking at the specs: Launch 330 lb, Propellant 199 lb = mass ratio 2.5:1 and Isp = 258 (or Ve = 2530 m/s).  So, in the absence of air or gravity you’d expect the final velocity to be ln(2.5)*2530  = 2320 m/s (Say, Mach 7).The 16 second burn time will eat 0.5 of that through gravity loss, and they got 5.5 after punching through 10 tons per square meter of atmosphere (or twice the rocket’s own mass for its cross-section).  Not bad.  Impressive work.Report commentReplyCharles Springersays:November 25, 2024 at 8:33 pmThe long skinny of ballistic coefficients? :-)Report commentReplyLeave a ReplyCancel replyPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

aircraft to use titanium structures due to the high speeds and heating titanium fins were most likely sls d printed for something like this that is probably easier than attaching a titanium coating because such a thin titanium nitride layer would still conduct a lot of heat to the base material just educated guesses but there might be an academic paper to accompany this projectgood work but probably nothing groundbreaking since solid fuel rockets and titanium manufacturing are pretty well known students yes but with usc rocket labs it is probably not too much of a stretch and not exactly

Some thrived under pressure, while others crashed and burned.ByPassant RabiePublished December 16, 2024|Comments (1)|ðCopied!From left to right: Boeing's Starliner at the ISS; Starship landing at the catch tower; Jared Isaacman performing the first commercial spacewalk.Â© NASA/SpaceX/Polaris DawnAlthough commercial spaceflight has been around since the 1960s, it’s managed to snake its way to the forefront of the space age over the past few years, slowly integrating itself into the national agenda of space travel. This past year has been tumultuous for the private space industry, testing just how big of a role it can play in the cosmos. Some companies crossed off major milestones in 2024, while others failed to rise to the occasion.In 2024, the Moon claimed two lunar landers, a crew of astronauts was left stranded in space in the infamous Starliner fiasco, and a giant tower caught the largest rocket ever built. After following the major spaceflight events, Gizmodo is breaking down the highlightsâand downfallsâof the industry during a crucial year.Don’t call it a failure: Boeing strands its astronautsFollowing years of delays, Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft finally launched for its first crewed test flight, transporting two astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) to fulfill adecade-old contract with NASA.Starliner launched on June 5, carrying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the ISS. The spacecraft struggled to dock with the space station after five of the spacecraftâs thrusters failed during its approach. Starliner also developedfive helium leaks, one of which had been identified prior to its launch.Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft approaching the ISS. Â© NASAThe spacecraft remained docked to the ISS for three months as teams on the ground debated whether to return the crew on board Starliner. Finally, NASA and Boeing agreed toreturn an uncrewed Starlinerand bring back the two astronauts on board SpaceXâs Dragon spacecraft. Thespacecraft undocked from the ISS on September 6, leaving its crew behind.Boeing officials described themedia coverage surrounding Starliner as “pretty painful,”and asked that reporters stop referring to the two NASA astronauts as being “stranded.” But really, we called it as we saw it, and we continue to cover a program that’s been plagued from the get-go.In 2014, NASA awarded Boeing and SpaceX contracts to provide launch services for crew and cargo to the ISS. So far, SpaceX has delivered nine crews to the space station, while Boeing has yet to complete a single operational mission. So far, Starliner has cost Boeing a whopping $1.85 billion in total losses. Under its $4.2 billion contract with NASA, Boeing retains full ownership of the Starliner spacecraft while NASA acts as a customer that will (eventually?) purchase round-trip missions to the ISS.After Starliner fumbled its first crewed flight, Boeing may be consideringselling off its space program altogether. At the time the two contracts were handed out, Boeing was at the top of its game, riding on its legacy from historical programs (including Apollo), while SpaceX was deemed an untrustworthy newcomer to the industry. Today, the stark contrast between the two companies illustrates just how far the private space industry has come under the new space age.Nice catch, SpaceX“The probability is uncertain, but it is above zero,” SpaceX CEO and founder Elon Musk said during avideointerview two years ago, explaining how his company plans on catching the largest rocket ever built and plucking it out of the air using giant mechanical arms. “Elon just said, delete the legs. Delete,” a SpaceX engineer said in the video. “We’ll just use the arms.”SpaceX’s Starship made history during its fifth test flight. Image: SpaceXSure enough, Musk’s seemingly dubious vision came to fruition this year. On October 13, Starship lifted off for a historic test flight. For the first time, Mechazilla, a 400-foot-tall tower with two extended arms, caught the rocketâs 232-foot-tall (71-meter) Super Heavy booster, cradling Starship on its way down.SpaceX’s prospective fully reusable super heavy-lift rocket edged closer to operational launches throughout the year, with each test flight proving more successful than the one before it.SpaceX launched its Starship rocket for the first time in April 2023,but its debut was less than ideal as the vehicle entered into a fatal tumble that forced ground controllers to issue a self-destruct command right before the four-minute mark of the mission.In November 2023, Starshipâssecond test flight resulted in the in-flight destruction of both the Super Heavy booster and upper stage, but it was still a major improvement from its inaugural flight. For theÂthird test flight in March, Starship successfully performed a stage separation, completed a full-duration burn of the second-stage engines, demonstrated internal propellant transfer for NASA, and tested the Starlink dispenser door. Starshipâsfourth liftoff in June broke new groundscompared to its previous test flights, with the rocket largely surviving peak heating and max aerodynamic pressure during its controlled reentry.SpaceX is developing the Starship human landing system (HLS), which will land astronauts near the Moonâs South Pole for NASA’s Artemis 3 and 4 missions. The company is also seeking to use the megarocket to deliver cargo to low Earth orbit, the Moon, and eventually Mars.More than just a space touristSince 2001, around 60 people have gone to space for tourism, traveling to suborbital heights to mainly check out the views. But this year, space tourism reached new heights, with private astronauts traveling to higher altitudes than ever before and performing the first commercial spacewalk.Billionaire Jared Isaacman emerging from Dragon.On September 12,Polaris Dawn became the first private mission to conduct a spacewalk, with two astronauts stepping outside a SpaceX capsule into the vacuum of space for a historic moment that broke new ground for commercial spaceflight. Polaris Dawn is the first of three private missions on board a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft purchased by tech entrepreneur, space enthusiast, and potential new head of NASA, Jared Isaacman.Can Billionaire Space Tourist Jared Isaacman Save NASA?The billionaire-funded mission reached a maximum orbit of 870 miles (1,400 kilometers) above Earth, also setting a new record for Earth-orbit apogee (the farthest point reached away from the planet) for a crewed mission. During the spacewalk, Isaacman was the first to climb his way outside of the Dragon spacecraft. He carried out a series of mobility tests of SpaceXâs brand new spacesuits, designed especially for the occasion, before stepping back into the crew cabin. Isaacman was followed by SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis, who conducted her own series of tests while outside of the hatch. The four astronauts stayed in orbit for five days, during which they conducted over 30 research studies and experiments.As far as private missions go, Polaris Dawn certainly set itself apart and set new standards for space tourists. President-elect Donald Trump tapped Isaacman to lead NASA as the space agency’s new administrator, so he might not have time for space tourism over the next few years.To the MoonIn February, Texas-based Intuitive Machines became thefirst private company to land on the Moon. The Odysseus lander delivered 12 payloads near the Malapert A crater in the Moonâs south pole region following an eight-day journey through space.Intuitive Machinesâ Odysseus lander touched down on the Moon on February 22, 2024. Image: Intuitive MachinesIt was a remarkable accomplishment, but not altogether perfect. Odysseus stumbled on its way to the lunar surface due to a navigation issue, and ended uptipped over on its side. In its less-than-ideal position, Odysseus could only receive sunlight on its horizontal solar panel. Despite its awkward landing, Odysseus still fulfilled its main task of performing a soft landing on the Moon to deliver payloads to the lunar surface.Landing on the Moon is not an easy feat, as Astrobotic’s shiny gold Peregrine lander proved with its failed journey to the lunar surface. Peregrinelaunched on January 8with plans to land on the Moon in late February, hoping to become the first private mission to touchdown on the lunar surface. The 2,829-pound (1,283-kilogram) spacecraft powered on and even made contact through NASAâs Deep Space Network, but Peregrineâs journey to the Moon started falling apart shortly afterwards. The lander began to lose propellant at a critical rate, prompting Astrobotic to give up on any chance of its lunar lander touching down on the Moon. The Pittsburgh-based company believes afaulty valve was the cause behind Peregrineâs anomaly.The two lunar landers were part of NASAâs Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative, which is meant to help the space agency in its quest to return humans to the Moon and make it a sustainable place for a long-term human presence. It’s also meant to usher in a new era for private companies by granting them greater access to the lunar surface and the ability to deliver payloads to the Moon.The private industry to the rescueCommercial space endeavors werenât the only ones to face setbacks this year, but private companies might be key to revitalizing the nationâs space agenda.NASA’sVIPER, or Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, is designed to find and study water ice on the Moonâs south pole. The $450 million mission was scheduled for launch in September 2025, but after suffering several supply chain delays,NASA decided to cancel VIPERâs lunar journey out of fear that it would disrupt other commercial payload missions to the Moon.When it first broke the news, NASA revealed that it would disassemble the VIPER rover and use its parts for future missions. The decision, however, sparked outrage from the science community over the loss of an innocent robot. In response, NASA abruptly put together a call for organizations to take over its lunar robot and send it to the Moon. Intuitive Machines stepped up to the plate. The company is currently working with other companies, research organizations, and international partners torespond to NASAâs request for information.In another show of commercial partnership, NASA selected Rocket Lab, the space industryâs rising star, to offer an alternative way to retrieve rock samples from the Martian surface and bring them to Earth. The company, with the ability to launch from both the U.S. and New Zealand, has been assigned with the task of developing an end-to-end mission concept for a fraction of the projected cost of NASAâs Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission that can be completed several years earlier than the space agencyâs current timeline.This may not have been a perfect year for private spaceflight, but the commercial industry is working to prove itself in the rapidly changing landscape of rocket launches (and catches), private trips to the cosmos, and tricky Moon landings.blue originSPACEXStarlinerStarshipDaily NewsletterGet the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.SelectNews from the future, delivered to your present.SelectPlease select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.Sign me upLeave this field empty if you're human:You May Also LikeScienceSpace & SpaceflightSpaceX Reportedly Lost Communication With Private Astronaut Mission Before Historic SpacewalkThe incident raises concerns about companies failing to disclose issues during commercial spaceflight missions.ByPassant RabiePublished December 18, 2024ScienceSpace & SpaceflightBoeing’s Stranded Astronauts Will Have to Stay on the ISS for Even LongerThe crew launched to the ISS in June for a week-long mission but will end up spending an unplanned nine months in space.ByPassant RabiePublished December 18, 2024Tech NewsNewsElon Musk Wants to Turn Texas Starbase Into a Company TownSpaceX wants to turn its Texas Starbase site into a city.ByAJ DellingerPublished December 13, 2024ScienceSpace & SpaceflightSpaceX Retrieves Starship Fragments off Australian CoastStarship's upper stage survived reentry and splashed down in the Indian Ocean following the rocket's sixth test flight.ByPassant RabiePublished December 12, 2024ScienceSpace & Spaceflight‘Cosmic Fireflies’ Spotted From the ISS Turn Out to Be a Total BuzzkillThe flying specks of light are Starlink satellites, far from a celestial wonder.ByPassant RabiePublished December 3, 2024Tech NewsTech PolicySpaceX Wins Approval to Provide Direct-to-Cell Service From SatellitesSpaceX's new satellites allowed some people in areas effected by hurricanes to send text messages earlier this year, now it will begin expanding the service commercially.ByTodd FeathersPublished November 27, 2024Latest newsRise of SkywalkerShowed LovingStar WarsHas Its LimitsMIT-Linked Company Says It Will Build ‘World’s First Grid-Scale’ Nuclear Fusion Power PlantSuperman’sTeaser Is the Biggest WB/DC Trailer EverDan Da Dan’sFirst Season 2 Look is More Foreboding Than FunWhere Will All of Big Techâs Nuclear Waste Go?Your Teeth Could Hold a Neanderthal Legacy, Study RevealsNASA Plans for ‘Continuous Heartbeat’ in Space After ISS Retirementio9 Survived theNosferatuExperienceThe Best Tech Gifts of 2024The Best Tech Gifts of 2024 âLatest newsRise of SkywalkerShowed LovingStar WarsHas Its Limits12/21/2024, 12:25 pmMIT-Linked Company Says It Will Build ‘World’s First Grid-Scale’ Nuclear Fusion Power Plant12/21/2024, 11:00 amSuperman’sTeaser Is the Biggest WB/DC Trailer Ever12/21/2024, 10:30 amDan Da Dan’sFirst Season 2 Look is More Foreboding Than Fun12/21/2024, 9:40 amLatest ReviewsThe Best Tech Gifts of 202412/19/2024, 4:54 pmThe D-20 Watch Will Never Beat Real Dice for D&D, but It Comes Close12/15/2024, 5:00 amSamsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus Review: So Light, So Expensive12/14/2024, 9:00 amGoogle Pixel Watch 3 Review: The Best Smartwatch for the Android Faithful12/10/2024, 8:43 amðSitemapEdiciÃ³n ESEdition FREdiÃ§Ã£o PTAccessibilityPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAdvertisingReprints & PermissionsYour Privacy ChoicesHow We Review ProductsWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.Â©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

The nose cone of USCRPL’s rocket points towards the moon, across Earth’s horizonAftershock II, the latest rocket designed and built by the student-runUSC Rocket Propulsion Lab(USCRPL) at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, has broken the international altitude record – reaching further into space than any non-governmental and non-commercial group has ever flown before.The previous 20-year record of 380,000 feet was set by Civilian Space Exploration Team back in 2004. Aftershock II beats that record by 90,000 ft.It also builds upon the group’s record as the first and only student organization to launch a student-designed and built rocket past the Kármán line in 2019.“This achievement represents several engineering firsts,” said Ryan Kraemer, executive engineer of USCRPL and an undergraduate student majoring in mechanical engineering. “Aftershock II is distinguished by the most powerful solid-propellant motor ever fired by students and the most powerful composite case motor made by amateurs.”In 2019, the USCRPL Traveler IV rocket was the first collegiate-designed and built rocket to pass the Kármán line, the boundary separating Earth’s atmosphere and outer space. Since then, the student-run team have been striving to beat their own record, seeking to claim the altitude record for amateur rocketry worldwide.The successful launch of Aftershock II took place on October 20 in the Black Rock Desert rocket launch area, Nevada (the student white paper verifying the data was posted onNovember 14th). Equipped with a new avionics unit and improved safety and data integration, Aftershock II reached a velocity of 5283 ft/s and Mach 5.5. The comparatively lightweight rocket amounted to 330 pounds, at a height of 13 ft and 8” diameter.Crucially, the endurance of the rocket at hypersonic speeds was made possible by a thermal protection system that included new paint and titanium-coated fins.“To exceed the standard we set for ourselves with Traveler IV, we had to solve many technical and operational challenges,” Kraemer explained. “Thermal protection at hypersonic speeds is a major challenge at the industry level, and the protective paint system that we developed performed perfectly, enabling the rocket to return largely intact. We also made an important upgrade to the fins, replacing the bare carbon edge of previous iterations with titanium leading edges. The titanium not only prevented fraying but actually turned blue from the intense heat during flight through anodization, which really demonstrates the extreme conditions our rocket successfully endured.”Furthermore, the custom-designed computer systems and circuit boards were designed and built from scratch by the student team, enabling the live integration of data. This allowed for tracking of the rocket’s position during flight, gathering data and recovering the rocket on descent.The USCRPL team with the rocket before liftoff“This is an exceptionally ambitious project not only for a student team, but for any non-professional group of rocket engineers,” said Dan Erwin, chair of the USC Department of Astronautical Engineering. “It’s a testament to the excellence we seek to develop in our emerging astronautical engineers, who go on to achieve top roles in the space industry and in government positions. The can-do, problem-solving mindset of USCRPL students has provided a foundation for leading startups including Relativity Space and Ursa Major. If you want to see what’s next for the space industry, keep an eye on USCRPL.”“Since its founding 20 years ago, the USC Rocket Propulsion Laboratory has made a reality of the aspirations and vision for space of countless Viterbi undergraduate students across all engineering majors,” said Dean Yannis Yortsos. “It is thrilling to see how they have now shattered not only their previous global student record of reaching the Kármán line in 2019, but also the record of any amateur team in history. This extraordinary group of students shows how to imagine, what can be done in the lab, and how to make it a reality. And throughout the 20-year history, how to translate their skills and knowledge to innovative startups.”Published on November 15th, 2024Last updated on December 5th, 2024Share this PostRelated StoriesBehind the Scenes at a National Renewable Energy Laboratory InternshipEngineering, Empowerment and Art: Introducing AME Faculty Member Neda MaghsoodiStressed at work?

The launch failure marks another setback for Japan’s private space industry after a series of explosive rocket attempts earlier this year.Japan’s Space One launched its Kairos rocket on Wednesday from the company’s Spaceport Kii launch pad in Kushimoto, Wakayama Prefecture. The rocket appeared to be flying normally at first, but things quickly started to fall apart. About two minutes after liftoff, Kairos appeared to lose attitude control, and began tumbling its way downwards. The rocket self-destructed after detecting abnormalities in the first-stage engine nozzle control and the rocket’s trajectory, Space One director Mamoru Endo told reporters during a post-launch briefing, according toReuters.Kairos was carrying five small satellites from the Taiwan Space Agency, and Japanese companies Lagrapo, Space Cubics, and Terra Space, as well as a fifth customer that wished to remain anonymous.This was Space One’s second attempt at becoming Japan’s first commercial firm to independently place satellites in Earth orbit (Japan’s space agency, JAXA, has accomplished this feat many times, working with firms like Mitsubishi Heavy Industries). The startupfirst attempted to launch Kairos in March, but the launch vehicle exploded mere seconds after clearing the tower in Wakayama prefecture. The rocket’s autonomous self-destruct system was set off due to anomalous flight settings about five seconds after launch. Kairos was carrying an experimental satellite for the Japanese government.Thethree-stage Kairos rocket, equipped with solid-fuel engines and a liquid-fuel post-boost stage, is designed to deliver payloads of up to 550 pounds (250 kilograms) to low Earth orbit. With its 59-foot (18-meter) tall rocket, Space One is hoping to compete with companies like SpaceX and Rocket Lab by delivering satellites to space both rapidly and affordably.Â The company aims to launch 30 rockets annually by the 2030s,accordingto Kyodo News.

For one, he would be the first billionaire to lead the agency. More importantly, though, he's on the cutting edge of the newcommercial space age, where private companies are becoming the biggest actors in space.AdvertisementJared Isaacman at SpaceX in Hawthorne, California.SpaceX/Business Wire via AP PhotoSome past NASA administrators were former NASA astronauts. Others were former executives from the aerospace industry. Many were politicians — including Trump's last NASA chief, Jim Bridenstine, and thecurrent administrator, Bill Nelson.Isaacman is none of those things. He has, however, flown to space in aCrew Dragon spaceship,conducted the first-ever commercial spacewalk in a brand-new SpaceX spacesuit, and plans to fly on future missions with the company — aboard its Starship mega-rocket, no less.The nomination, which still has to be confirmed by the Senate, suggests that Trump wants to shake things up at NASA.AdvertisementJared Isaacman stands at the hatch of Crew Dragon during the world's first commercial spacewalk.SpaceX""He certainly has the potential to be a disruptor,"" Leroy Chiao, a former NASA astronaut andInternational Space Stationcommander who now works in consulting, told Business Insider. ""I think it's a great pick. It's much better than just status quo — another retiring member of Congress.""It's also another signal that Trump might make a big push to put the next humans on the moon, and eventhe first humans on Mars.Speeding up the road to MarsIsaacman's enthusiasm for space exploration isn't his only bona fide. He also has a businessman's mindset and a close relationship withElon Musk. The two share the goal of getting humans to Mars.AdvertisementChiao hopes Isaacman can speed up the process.Indeed, in a post on X accepting the nomination, Isaacman wrote that NASA would help make humanity ""a true spacefaring civilization.""""Americans will walk on the Moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth,"" he added.AdvertisementNASA is already working on it. The Artemis programbegan as the last Trump administration's iteration of a multi-president effort to send humans to deep space again. Artemisaims tosend astronauts back to the moonfor the first time in over 50 years, and eventually to use the moon as a jumping-off point to send people to Mars.However, Artemis is years behind schedule and billions over budget, largely due to technical and programmatic challenges with the giant Space Launch System that NASA is building for moon missions. Many industry commentators see SLS as a waste of government funds, when NASA could instead lean on commercial heavy-lift rockets like Starship.NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket with the Orion spacecraft aboard, at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.NASA/Steve Seipel""Frankly, we have been at the status quo of this exploration program in one form or another over the last several presidents since 2004,"" Chiao said, ""and we're not even close to launching the first astronaut on a new vehicle.""AdvertisementIn fact, NASA justpushed back the launch datefor its first crewed Artemis mission, set to fly around the moon using SLS. On Thursday the agency delayed the mission by another seven months, to April 2026, citing issues with the system's Orion spaceship.That's the slow-moving status quo that Trump might aim to shake up.To that end, efficiency may be a top priority for Isaacman. That could mean reassessing Artemis entirely or cutting back some of NASA's centers and facilities nationwide, according to Abhi Tripathi, a former NASA engineer and SpaceX mission director who now leads mission operations at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Lab.Advertisement""I definitely think SLS will be on the chopping board,"" Tripathi told BI.First, though, Isaacman will have to go through Congress.""He is going to ruffle a lot of feathers,"" Chiao said.AdvertisementPushing through CongressCongress can be a formidable wall for anyone trying to revolutionize NASA.Related storiesIn places like Alabama and Southern California, a status quo NASA fuels the work of legacy aerospace contractors like Boeing and Northrop Grumman.""The majority of members of Congress want jobs in their district, and they look at the space program primarily through that lens,"" Tripathi said.AdvertisementPlus, he added, ""the lobbying arms of all of those big contractors will be basically camped outside their congressional representative's office, asking them to thwart any big plans that would change the status quo greatly.""It'll all come to a head when the Trump White House makes its budget proposal. That's when Congress will approve or deny any cuts or reprioritizations that Trump and his NASA Administrator try to make.If Trump wants to put boots on Mars fast, he'll have to convince individual Congress members to push those changes through.Advertisement""I think Jared is a very smart and capable individual,"" Tripathi said, ""but his ability to wield power will completely depend upon how much his president will back him up.""Read nextNASASpaceXDonald TrumpMore...AdvertisementClose iconTwo crossed lines that form an 'X'.

                      subscribers.Become an Insiderand start reading now.Have an account?Log in.CEOs are often known for their unique morning routines for optimizing productivity.These routines include activities like meditation and early wake-up times.One CEO said he likes to spend two hours reading newspapers after he wakes up.AdvertisementWhen your daily work schedule involves running a company, starting off your morning right is crucial for many leaders.From hour-long meditations to 4 a.m. waking times, we examined the morning routines of the CEOs of some of the world's biggest businesses.AdvertisementMark ZuckerbergFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg starts off his day by checking his social media.David Zalubowski/ AP ImagesLike his fitness routine, there's a good chance Mark Zuckerberg's morning habits have evolved over time. But in an old Facebook Live Q&A, theMeta CEOsaid he wakes up at 8 a.m. and immediately checks Facebook, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp on his phone.His social media browsing usually lasts only a few minutes, he said at the time, though it sometimes stretches out longer depending on the day.""It's a pretty sad situation, to be honest,"" he said. ""I have contacts, and I can't see very well. And before I put my contacts in, I often look to see what is going on Facebook.""Zuckerberg then usually follows up his screen time with gym time. Although he used to work out at least three times a week, usually running, hetold Joe Roganin 2022 that he didn't like how running gave him time to ""think a lot.""Instead, he wanted to find something ""that's both super engaging physically but also intellectually"" where he is unable to focus on anything else.""MMA is the perfect thing because if you stop paying attention for one second, you're going to end up on the bottom,"" Zuckerberg said.The Facebook founder said onLex Fridman's podcastin 2023 that he did three to four jiu-jitsu and MMA sessions weekly, along with strength and conditioning work and mobility training.AdvertisementTim CookApple CEO Tim Cook wakes up at 4 a.m. to check emails.Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Apple CEO likes tostart his morningas early as 4 a.m. to 5 a.m. and spends his first waking hour on emails.Cook is ""pretty religious"" about reading a lot of emails from customers and employees, he said in a 2023 episode of ""Dua Lipa: At Your Service.""""The customers are telling me things that they love about us or things that they want changed about us. Employees are giving me ideas,"" he said. ""But it's a way to stay grounded in terms of what the community is feeling, and I love it.""Cook then said that he spends an hour at the gym, usually doing strength training.""I've got somebody to really push me to do things I don't want to do, and I do no work during that period of time at all,"" he said. ""I never check my phone.""Although it's unclear if he eats breakfast daily, he reportedly ""dug into scrambled egg whites, sugar-free cereal, unsweetened almond milk, and bacon"" during a2017 interviewwith Andrew Ross Sorkin, a columnist at The New York Times.AdvertisementSam AltmanOpenAI CEO Sam Altman says mornings are his most productive time of day.MicrosoftOpenAI's chief executivewrote in a 2018 blog post that the first few hours of the morning are his ""most productive time of the day,"" so he makes sure to keep those periods free of meetings.Altman said in the blog post that he rarely eats breakfast, instead opting for a big shot of espresso after waking up. As a result, he said he gets around 15 hours of fasting.AdvertisementEvan SpiegelSnap CEO Evan Spiegel likes to wake up at 5 a.m. for some alone time.Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesAnother early riser, the Snap CEO wakes up at 5 a.m. for some alone time, Spiegel said in a 2018 interview that appeared in theEntrepreneurship Handbook.""I get up really early, because that's the only time that's 'Evan Time' for me, when people aren't really awake yet,"" he said. ""I get a couple hours between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m. to do whatever I wanna do.""Earlier this year, Snap told Business Insider thatSpiegel likes to check the app and his emailafter waking up and then drinks a double espresso. Then, he goes to the gym for 45 minutes or meditates.Spiegel toldVogue Australiain 2022 that his wife, Australian model Miranda Kerr, got him ""hooked on Kriya meditation,"" which he called ""life-changing.""Kerr, founder of Kora Organics, has also reportedly put Spiegel on the brand's brand's turmeric brightening and exfoliating mask.""He doesn't use it as an actual mask; he keeps it in the shower and uses it as an exfoliant,"" Kerr toldNew Beautyin 2019.She added, ""What he loves about it is that it has peppermint oil in it, so it's so invigorating. He says he can't be without it because it's his little boost of aromatherapy in the morning! It gives him energy!""AdvertisementJeff BezosFormer Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos goes to the gym almost every day.AP Photo/John LocheThe former Amazon CEO seems to have a slightly more relaxed start to his day and said he likes to ""putter in the morning,"" Axiosreportedin 2018.""So I like to read the newspaper,"" he said. ""I like to have coffee. I like have breakfast with my kids before they go to school.""He and his fiancé, Lauren Sánchez, have a no-phone rule during the mornings and share a ""magic moment"" before the kids wake up, SáncheztoldPeople.The two also try to journal together, she said in 2023interviewwith Vogue, though admits that they're ""not quite there"" yet and do it three times a week.

""Which is really helpful.""Bezos then sets his first meeting at 10 a.m. and said he likes to do his ""high-IQ meetings"" before noon, according to Axios.""Like anything that's going to be really mentally challenging, that's a 10 o'clock meeting,"" he said. ""And by 5 p.m., I'm like, 'I can't think about that today. Let's try this again tomorrow at 10 a.m.'""AdvertisementPeter WarwickScholastic CEO Peter Warwick enjoys a ""vigorous"" 7 a.m. walk or jog with his wife every morning.Scholastic Inc; Getty Images; Alyssa Powell/BIThe Scholastic CEOpreviously toldBI that he wakes up between 5:30 a.m. and 6 a.m., drinks coffee, checks emails, and scans the news to start his day.For world, political, and business news, Warwick turns to The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Financial Times.

""So I enjoy meditation, which I've been doing for over a decade — probably to help relieve the stress I was going through when I was working at Oracle.""He has extended his love of the practice to his employees by having meditation rooms on every floor at aSalesforce building in San Francisco, an idea he said was inspired by the Plum Village monks.AdvertisementPeter BeckPeter Beck is the CEO of space company, Rocket Lab.Rocket LabCEO of space companyRocket Lab, Peter Beck,previously toldBI that he starts his day between 4:30 and 5 a.m. in New Zealand by immediately going through emails.He also completely forgoes breakfast and coffee.""I can't drink coffee,"" Beck said. ""It completely knocks me out and puts me to sleep.""But sometimes, his mornings can start hours before his already early schedule depending on his company's projects — which can have sporadic timing as a rocket business.""The rocket launches when the rocket needs to launch,"" Beck said. ""So if that's 2 a.m. in the morning, it's 2 a.m. in the morning.""AdvertisementBob IgerBob Iger, CEO of Disney, likes to wake up as early as 4:15 a.m.Brendan McDermid/ReutersWhen theDisney CEOgets up at 4:15 a.m., he tries to avoid looking at his phone until after his morning exercise routine.Iger saidat a summit hosted by Vanity Fairin 2018 that he tries to exercise and think before he reads.""Because if I read, it throws me off, it's distracting,"" he said. ""I'm immediately thinking about usually someone else's thoughts instead of my own.""Iger added that he likes being alone with his own thoughts and said that it gives him ""an opportunity to not just replenish but to organize, and it's important.""To further protect from distractions, Iger saidhe works outin a darkened room with the TV on mute, which he watches while his own music plays.AdvertisementJack DorseyJack Dorsey likes to meditate every morning.Joe RaedleJack Dorsey, the cofounder of Block and X, formerly Twitter,used to wake up at around 5 a.m. and start his day with 30 minutes of meditation and then a series of seven-minute workouts, he said in a 2015 live chat.Although he had built a very consistent routine during his time running Twitter, Dorsey said in a 2018podcast interviewwith Ben Greenfield that he now wakes up at 6:15 a.m. and begins with an hour of meditation and then a cup of coffee.""I'll say that my routine today is completely different than my routine three years ago but I feel like I have a lot of it dialed in based on what I'm currently experiencing in terms of stress and just what I have to do every day,"" Dorsey told Greenfield.AdvertisementJaimie DimonJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon likes to read several newspapers in the morning.Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty ImagesThe JPMorgan CEO starts his morning at 5 a.m. and spends two hours reading five newspapers, analyst and internal bank reports, and even speech transcripts, The Wall Street Journalreported.He then exercises for 45 minutes, doing aerobics, light weights, or stretches.

Sometimes, that’s a good thingNovember 21, 2024Ryan MenezesStories abound about scientists who do something stupid in a lab and stumble on a discovery.For example, there was the time a scientist was told to test a chemical, and he misheard that as “taste” the chemical, and he found to his surprise that the chemical was sweet. Thatled to the creation of Splenda. Or there was the time a scientist contaminated his food with a chemical and found to his surprise that the chemical was sweet, and that’s how he discovered saccharin. Or there was a scientist who spilled a chemical on a cigarette and was surprised that this made it sweet, which was how we got cyclamate. Or there was a scientist who just licked his hands for no reason, he was surprised they were sweet and that’s how we got aspartame.Don't Miss21 Myths Everyone Believes About The Human BodyAuthorsAM SmileyPublished04/01/201736 of the Funniest Tweets from Thursday, December 19, 2024AuthorsIan GarnerPublished12/19/20249 Terrifying Things Doctors Pulled Out Of Living PeopleAuthorsAlex Hanton,Tiago Svn,Ivan Farkas,Kelly Stone,Peter I. SantiagoPublished12/28/2017There are even one or two such stories thatdon’tend with the creation of an artificial sweetener. For example...5The Apron That Caught FireIn 1846, chemist Christian Schönbein was messing around with some vials of stuff when he spilled a bunch of nitric acid and sulfuric acid on his table. The acids weren’t quite strong enough to eat through the table and through whoever lived one floor below, so he just grabbed an apron andmopped up the spill. Then he tossed the apron over the nearby stove to dry.The apron caught fire. That’s not supposed to happen. Though cotton can catch fire, a damp cloth is supposed to take in a lot of heat without igniting, otherwise we could never iron clothes. But a chemical reaction had occurred, and Schönbein had created nitrocellulose, a deeply flammable material. Flammable stuff has its uses, and nitrocellulose later became guncotton, used in guns. Sure, one early factory making the stuffexploded, killing 20 workers, but factories were exploding all the time back then regardless, so it was a good invention overall.viaWiki CommonsThey took a break for 15 years and then got back to making it.Later, we discovered a new use for nitrocellulose. We could use it to make film, jump-starting photography. This, in turn, led to celluloid, which remained similarly flammable. If you’ve been planning to set any assassination targets on fire, we recommend doing so in a 1940s movie theater.Advertisement4The Slow Creation of LSDSure, spilling acid on the table can be nice, when it catches fire. But we know what sort of acid you’re really interested in. It’s lysergic acid diethylamide, that psychedelic drug that had its heyday back in the 1960s because it was completely legal until 1968.LSD was famously invented by Albert Hofmann, who went on to be a great proponent of such drugs. But Hofmann didn’t set out to create a chemical to make you see swirling colors. He was trying to make an analeptic, a stimulant that hits the respiratory system. In 1938, this resulted in his synthesizing LSD. Because it wasn’t what he was aiming for, he did nothing with the discovery for five years.AdvertisementPsychonaught/Wiki CommonsHad he deployed it properly, he probably could have stopped World War II.Then in 1943, he returned to the substance he’d made. This time, he accidentally ingested some,through his fingertips. This felt stimulating in a whole other way from what he’d planned, and he abandoned his old hobby of respiratory treatment in favor of something far more fun.3The First PlasticLong before we started making plastics out of oil, we’d been on the hunt for some material we could mold into any shape we like. We had ceramics, of course, but those tended to be brittle. We also hemacite, a mixture ofblood and sawdust. This, too, offered some disadvantages.Then, in 1907, an inventor named Leo Baekeland was messing around with two chemicals, phenol and formaldehyde. He wasn’t trying to make a moldable material. He was trying to make a replacement for shellac, which is a shiny wood coat made from mushed-up insects. But a moldable material was what he found himself with.AdvertisementAdvertisementBakelite CorporationHe made it in this, which he also used for resurrecting the dead.We call the result Bakelite, after its creator. It was the first plastic made from synthetic materials. In fact, Baekeland was the first person to refer to materials as “plastics.” If it weren’t for him, we’d still have ended up making plastics from oil, but we would have called it something else, like whackadillies.2When They Made Penicillin, They Thankfully Used the Wrong AnimalYou’ve surely heard about how penicillin was accidentally discovered. Alexander Fleming was trying to culture bacteria, and some unintended mold was keeping the stuff from reproducing properly. He gradually realized that this substance with antibiotic properties wasn’t a problem but a solution.But the penicillin that Fleming found wasn’t so great after all. He had discovered the fungusPenicillium notatumall right, but it didn’t make enough penicillin for anyone to be able to use it. Scientists now tried a bunch of other molds to see if they worked any better, and none seemed to. We only got a useable strain ofPenicilliumbecause a lab worker named Mary Hunt found someon a rotting cantaloupe. She bought the fruit to serve and eat it, not hoping to find mold there, but then she did find mold and tested it because the lab was trying every mold they could get their hands on.AdvertisementUSDAWe think that’s her on the left, but no one’s quite sure.We also settled on penicillin thanks to a third bit of serendipity. The scientists testing how it worked at killing infections in animals tested it on mice. That sounds normal, since there are plenty of reasons to test on mice, but you might know that guinea pigs were the other traditional animal for testing. Well, penicillin istoxic to guinea pigs, so if they’d tried it on guinea pigs, the subjects would have all died. Had that happened, the scientists would have said, “Huh, guess mold kills you, unsurprisingly,” and would never pursued that line of research again.Advertisement1No One Would Have Made the Plasma Globe on PurposeAdvertisementAnd now, let’s touch on the most important scientific invention of all-time. It’s this thing:Diliff/Wiki CommonsOh, that thing. The Whackadilly.It’s called a plasma globe. You probably saw it once at a museum as a kid, where it was supposed to teach you something or another, and you haven’t thought about it in years. It ostensibly aimed to teach you electricity (voltage across noble gases creates plasma, and your hand conducts electricity, so colored plasma shows up wherever you touch), but it really aimed to get you interested in the broad concept of science.It was invented in 1971 by MIT undergrad Bill Parker, who was trying to create rocket fuel. He increased the pressure in a vial too much, and suddenly, electricity made visible plasma. This had no applications whatever for rocket engines, but he noted (like so many others soon would) that it looked really cool.Years later, he’d get a job at a museum, he’d put the globe on display and it would become famous. But the night he invented it, he just took it home to his girlfriend’s toshow off at a house party. We don’t know if there was LSD at this party, and frankly, we don’t think they needed any.FollowRyan MenezesonTwitterfor more stuff no one should see.FacebookTwitterPinterestFlipboardRedditScroll down

ESA estimates that Earth orbit harbors about 40,500 objects at least 4 inches (10 centimeters) wide, 1.1 million pieces between 0.4 inches and 4 inches (1 to 10 cm) in diameter and 130 million that are at least 1 millimeter wide.Even these tiny shards can be dangerous to satellites or crewed craft like the ISS, given the tremendous speeds at which they travel. For example, at the station's average altitude of 250 miles (400 kilometers), orbital velocity is about 17,500 mph (28,160 kph).Dodging debris isn't a rare occurrence, as the events of the past week show.

And it all started with his work at a water heater company and a few dozen cold calls that ended with one to NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab.There's much more to this story--including some intriguing advice for entrepreneurs--but you'll have to tune in to learn more!

Pédoussaut) – click to enlargeThis time, all went according to plan, and the payload, Sentinel-1C, a radar satellite for ESA's Copernicus program, was placed into a Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) at an altitude of 700 km. The spacecraft separated 1 hour and 43 minutes after liftoff.The arrival of Sentinel-1C is not a moment too soon. The nominal mission for the Sentinel-1 program is to have two satellites flying in the same orbit, but 180 degrees apart, to maximize global coverage. Sentinel-1A is still operational, but Sentinel-1B failed at the end of 2021 and wasdeclared a loss by ESA in 2022.""The satellite has been successfully de-orbited and will reenter Earth’s atmosphere within 25 years,"" according to ESA.Sentinel-1A is due to be replaced by Sentinel-1D in 2025.The December 2022 Vega-C failure was attributed to a problem with the nozzle of the Zefiro-40 second stage. A redesigned nozzlefailedduring testing in 2023, pushing back the return to flight to 2024.Another satellite in the Sentinel program, Sentinel-6, wasloftedon a SpaceX Falcon 9, and ESA has had to turn to other companies for launches due to the retirement of the Ariane 5, delays with Ariane 6, and the Vega C issues.Arianespace's Vega C delayed after gantry throws a tantrumEurope's Vega C rocket cleared for launch tonight, first since 2022Vega rocket's last blast hurls Sentinel-2C satellite into orbitAriane 6 ready to rocket, bringing heavy-lift capability back to EuropeOn the same day as the latest Vega-C take-off, SpaceX launched a Sirius XM satellite into orbit from Florida on a Falcon 9 rocket. The mission also marked the 100th landing of a Falcon 9 first-stage booster on the Just Read the Instructions droneship. It was the 380th recovery overall as SpaceX nears yet another milestone.By comparison, the Vega-C mission marked the 351st launch by Arianespace in a considerably longer timeframe.ESA's Director of Space Transportation, Toni Tolker-Nielsen,said: ""Today's launch marks a crucial step forward, reaffirming European independent access to space. With Vega-C back in flight and the inaugural launch of Ariane 6 in July, we are in a great place going forward and I salute all the hard-working teams all over Europe and its spaceport who have worked tirelessly to achieve this success.""Brave words aside, it is difficult not to make comparisons with SpaceX and its reusable Falcon 9 first-stage, or even the steps toward reuse being made by smaller commercial launch suppliers such as Rocket Lab.The Vega-C has a busy few years ahead of it. While not at SpaceX levels of launch cadence, it is still far greater than the three launches, including one failure, that it has achieved since 2022. ®Get ourTech ResourcesShareMore aboutAerospaceESASpaceMore like these×More aboutAerospaceESASpaceNarrower topicsArtemisAsteroidAstronomyAviationBlack HoleBlue OriginBoeingCSAEarthExomoonExoplanetGalaxyHubble Space TelescopeISROISSJames Webb Space TelescopeJAXAMoonNASARoscosmosSatelliteSolar SystemSpaceXSquare Kilometre ArrayBroader topicsAustriaBelgiumCzech RepublicDenmarkEstoniaFinlandFranceGermanyGreeceHungaryIrelandItalyLuxembourgNetherlandsNorwayPolandPortugalRomaniaSpainSwedenSwitzerlandUnited KingdomMore aboutShare7COMMENTSMore aboutAerospaceESASpaceMore like these×More aboutAerospaceESASpaceNarrower topicsArtemisAsteroidAstronomyAviationBlack HoleBlue OriginBoeingCSAEarthExomoonExoplanetGalaxyHubble Space TelescopeISROISSJames Webb Space TelescopeJAXAMoonNASARoscosmosSatelliteSolar SystemSpaceXSquare Kilometre ArrayBroader topicsAustriaBelgiumCzech RepublicDenmarkEstoniaFinlandFranceGermanyGreeceHungaryIrelandItalyLuxembourgNetherlandsNorwayPolandPortugalRomaniaSpainSwedenSwitzerlandUnited KingdomTIP US OFFSend us newsOther stories you might likeAxiom Space shuffles space station assembly sequence – to get it standalone soonerAiming to be freeflying by 2028.

OPT-OUTHEREEdit StoryForbesInnovationScienceEditors' PickThe Prototype: $5 Million XPrize Awarded For Using Drones To Monitor RainforestsAlex KnappForbes StaffAlex Knapp is a Forbes senior editor covering healthcare and science.FollowingNov 22, 2024,09:00am ESTShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinIn this week’s edition of The Prototype, we look at using drones to protect the rainforest, the newest space billionaire, why you need to get up and move around during the day and more.You can sign up to get The Prototype in your inbox here.XPrizeThis week, the XPrize Foundation announced the winners of its XPrize Rainforest Competition. Since 2019, over 300 teams have been competing for the prize, which was looking for technology that enabled rapid and accurate surveys of rainforest biodiversity to improve conservation efforts.The winner of the $5 million grand prize wasLimelight Rainforest, which developed a drone-deployed system of sensors that could identify a wide range of species with the help of machine learning. During the final competition it was able to identify over 250 species in just 24 hours.“This competition successfully pushed the boundaries of conservation technology, and will uncover new knowledge about this precious part of our planet,” XPrize CEO Anousheh Ansarisaid in a press release.Quick housekeeping note: there will be no edition of the Prototype next Friday. Happy Thanksgiving!Rocket Lab’s Founder Peter Beck Just Became The World’s Newest Space BillionaireGetty ImagesRocket Lab, a space company that develops and launches rockets, satellites and other spacecraft for government and commercial customers, has seen its stock soar by more than 300% over the last year. That’s made its founder and CEO, Peter Beck, a billionaire thanks to his 10% stake in the company, reports my colleague Matt Durot.“There’s excitement because the Neutron, which is a significantly bigger rocket [than Rocket Lab’s existing Electron launch vehicle], will compete to a degree with SpaceX’s rockets and dramatically improve the economics of the company,” Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andres Sheppard toldForbes, noting that Rocket Lab is already the third most frequent orbital launcher globally behind SpaceX and the Chinese government. “Rocket Lab is the only one of those that can be invested in through the public markets, which is a big reason in our view that the stock has continued to run up.”A self-taught aerospace engineer, Beck, 47, skipped college and went to work in 1993 as an apprentice in New Zealand at appliance manufacturer Fisher & Paykel, where he rose through roles in precision engineering, production machinery design and product design and analysis over the course of a decade, while building rockets in his spare time. In 2003, Beck moved to a New Zealand government research institute where he led engineering programs focused on optimizing technologies like wind turbines and superconductors, before leaving to launch Rocket Lab in 2006.Read the whole story atForbes.DISCOVERY OF THE WEEK: BLOOD TEST PREDICTS RISK OF PREMATURE BIRTHResearchers at Ohio State University College of Nursing havedeveloped a blood testthat can potentially predict the risk ofpreterm birthduring the early stages of a pregnancy with about97.5% accuracy. The test looks for biomarkers in blood caused by stress, sleep deprivation and other factors that can increase preterm birth risk, and being able to identify this early can help doctors guide their patients towards ahealthier pregnancy. The next step is to do anexpanded studyof the test with more patients to ensure it’s still accurate within a larger population.FINAL FRONTIER: SPACEX LAUNCHES STARSHIP A SIXTH TIMEThis week,SpaceXconducted thesixth testof itsStarshipspacecraft. It was successfully launched into space on its planned trajectory and completed a test of its engine capability to safely deorbit. Starship returned to Earth and safely splashed down in the Indian Ocean. However, due to a detected error, the company had to abort its plan to “catch” the rocket booster, which was diverted away from the launch site and safely splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico.FORBES CALLED IT: ROCKET LAB EDITIONPeter Beckmay have only hitbillionaire statusthis month, but he’s been onForbes’ radar for much longer. I interviewed him for the first timeover nine years agowhen Rocket Lab first unveiled itsRutherford engine, which would later go on to power theElectron rocketthat the company has now successfully launched on over 40 missions.WHAT ELSE I WROTE THIS WEEKThis week,Forbespublishedour annualCIO Next list, recognizing innovative leaders in the Chief Information Officer role (and related titles), which I co-edited with my colleague Richard Nieva.As part of the CIO Next List package,I interviewedNASA CIOJeff Seatonabout his role in managing the space agency’s immense information infrastructure.In my other newsletter, InnovationRx,I reported concernson the potential impact of President-elect Trump’s plans to appointRobert F. Kennedy, Jr.as Secretary of Health and Human Services.SCIENCE AND TECH TIDBITSStartup Tokamak Energyraised $125 millionin investment backing to continue its efforts to build a workingfusion powerplant.A study that followed 2 million people with an 11-year follow-up found thatregular physical activitygenerallyreduced mortalityacross all age groups.Researchers figured out how touse catalysts and lightto break down PFASs (aka“forever chemicals.”)TheExploration Company, which is developing a cargo spacecraft calledNyx, just raised a$160 million series B round, bringing its total investment backing to $230 million.PRO SCIENCE TIP: STOP SITTING SO MUCHResearchers atMass General Brighamfound that people who aresedentaryfor long periods of time during the day show an increased risk of heart disease–even if they are getting regular exercise. “Exercise is critical, but avoiding excessive sitting appears separately important,"" study author Patrick Ellinor said in astatement. The findingswere publishedin theAmerican Journal of Cardiology.WHAT’S ENTERTAINING ME THIS WEEKI’m currently reading the novelCivilizationsby Laurent Binet, an alternate history where a group ofVikingsdidn’t just make it toNorth Americabut continued to go south, introducing the civilizations there tohorses and iron, making the first tripChristopher Columbustook to the New World go quite differently.

This is achieved through modeling various factors, including climate, interstellar environments, biosignatures that are like life's fingerprints, and the overall chemical processes that might occur in these places. But what exactly are we looking for when it comes to ""habitability?"" A blue paradise — or, the bare minimum?Charity Phillips-Lander, a senior research scientist at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) who is currently studying organics in icy world laboratory analogs, has begun exploring whether this tool can help characterize the role ofharshenvironments in supporting microbial life.""The question of habitability is about constraining the environmental factors that make it more likely to be friendly to life versus inhospitable,"" she said in astatement. ""Most geochemical modeling software doesn't account for organics [carbon-based molecules] at the conditions expected on ocean worlds, so I couldn't model things that I was seeing in the lab during laboratory investigations of the conditions of ice-covered moons in oursolar system, likeEuropaand Enceladus.""You may likeIf we want to find life on Saturn's moon Enceladus, we need to rule out Earthly hitchhikersSigns of life could survive on solar system moons Enceladus and EuropaPhillips-Lander and her colleague Florent Bocher developed their own modeling software, using it to simulate the formation of organic-doped ice pores — ice structures that incorporate or interact with organic compounds via microscopic pores — and explore how these structures might behave under extreme environments. The formation of these ice pores is a phenomenon that can also occur onEarth, particularly in polar regions or in glacial ice. This process happens when ice undergoes changes such as freezing, thawing or sublimation, leading to the creation of porous structures that may trap organic molecules.In laboratory settings, scientists intentionally create ""organics-doped ice"" to replicate these conditions and study how such structures might form or behave on other worlds. This includes exploring how factors like varying temperatures, pressures and cosmic radiation could produce similar porous formations — conditions that Phillips-Lander has been investigating in her own lab work.By combining these laboratory observations with accurate computational models, researchers can gain valuable insights into how ice behaves in environments beyond Earth, with a particular focus on its potential to support life or chemical reactions under extreme conditions.Get the Space.com NewsletterBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to theTerms & ConditionsandPrivacy Policyand are aged 16 or over.""With improvements, this tool will be able to provide a great deal of valuable information about ocean worlds,"" Bocher said.

science officescientists are turning to chemical modeling to determine whether icy moons in our solar system have what it takes to host life microbial life that isin general chemistry models are crucial for understanding the conditions that could support life as we know it on other planets this is achieved through modeling various factors including climate interstellar environments biosignatures that are like lifes fingerprints and the overall chemical processes that might occur in these places but what exactly are we looking for when it comes to habitability a blue paradise or the bare minimumcharity phillipslander a senior research scientist at southwest research institute swri who is currently studying organics in icy world laboratory analogs has begun exploring whether this tool can help characterize the role ofharshenvironments in supporting microbial lifethe question of habitability is about constraining the environmental factors that make it more likely to be friendly to life versus inhospitable she said in astatement most geochemical modeling software doesnt account for organics carbonbased molecules at the conditions expected on ocean worlds so i couldnt

modeling software using it to simulate the formation of organicdoped ice pores ice structures that incorporate or interact with organic compounds via microscopic pores and explore how these structures might behave under extreme environments the formation of these ice pores is a phenomenon that can also occur onearth particularly in polar regions or in glacial ice this process happens when ice undergoes changes such as freezing thawing or sublimation leading to the creation of porous structures that may trap organic moleculesin laboratory settings scientists intentionally create organicsdoped ice to replicate these conditions and study how such structures might form or behave on other worlds this includes exploring how factors like varying temperatures pressures and cosmic radiation could produce similar porous formations conditions that phillipslander has been investigating in her own lab workby combining these laboratory observations with accurate computational models

Likewise, you can spend dozens of hours in Factorio making the automated assembly lines of your dreams, but can you also make friends with the cute librarian while fixing up a sleepy town?Little Rocket Lab, from developer Teenage Astronauts and published by No More Robots, looks like the best of both worlds: a factory builder constructed inside a cozy life sim. Revealed today atWholesome Snack, in Little Rocket Lab you'll step into the work boots of Morgan, an engineer who likes tinkering, helping out the locals, and has dreams of constructing her very own rocket ship. Take a look at the trailer:Little Rocket Lab - Announcement Trailer - YouTubeWatch OnThere's a lot to like here: small projects to enhance the town like fixing up a lighthouse, huge assembly lines to sort materials and build products, a robot that looks like a giant toaster on legs you can ride around, and a faithful dog that follows you everywhere.I'm especially curious about the claw that seems to be transporting a citizen across a river by picking them up… by thehead. As public transportation goes, it looks uncomfortable. But efficient!""Outside of smashing together crazy contraptions, you'll need to mine out resources, explore coasts, railyards, quarries and underground areas—and get some help from a few mechanical friends along the way,"" says publisher No More Robots. ""And each area of the town provides different challenges, incorporating electrical elements, water, cranes, furnaces, crafting, automation through robotics, and loads more.""It all looks pretty delightful, not just from a builder's perspective but from a life sim standpoint, because you're helping the town out with your little inventions while also constructing a huge dang rocketship in a massive hangar.

This reflects an impressive 398% year to date return, fueled by increased investor risk appetite and a vibrant market environment. Currently, the company has a market capitalization of $13.5 billion, with expected annual revenue growth of 77%.Rocket Lab Hits Record $27.5, Surges 400% YTD Amid Space Industry BoomSome financial highlights include the third quarter of 2024 revenues of $105 million, 55% more than a year earlier. So, in Q4, Rocket Lab's projected revenues are $125-$135 million and gross margins of 26-28%. Further, expanding the company's growth narrative, the company has been awarded a $23.9 million grant following the recent signing of the CHIPS Act to advance to increase semiconductor production in Albuquerque, New Mexico.The aerospace businesses also started their growth with this company. Its Neutron rocket went through the qualification process and secured the first commercial order. This is well aligned with Rocket Lab's current Electron rocket, which will be instrumental in this firm. Wall Street has paid attention, adjusting price targets for the Company BofA Securities, Cantor Fitzgerald, and TD Cowen to show a hopeful forward for Rocket Lab.Rocket Lab's progress includes building and launching the Neutron rocket while achieving notable milestones. The company has accomplished two launches in under 24 hours and secured a multi-launch deal for its Neutron lander. It has achieved these milestones by demonstrating its position as a responsive space solutions provider and a comprehensive aerospace solutions and services company.?This article first appeared onGuruFocus.View CommentsTermsandPrivacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesRecommended StoriesCopyright © 2024 Yahoo.

All life on Earth requires it in some way or another, and it's hard to miss that roughly 70% of our planet's surface is covered in the stuff. Thus, understanding where Earth's water came from is a very important part of understanding life's origins, and researchers were pretty sure they knew how it got here — up until 2014.Basically, scientists previously believed that Earth's liquid reservoirs arrived here on icyasteroidsand comets from the outer regions of thesolar systemduring the early stages of Earth's formation. However, a 2014 analysis of the molecular constituents of water on the comets that likely seeded Earth's water cast doubt on the hypothesis.. Andnow, the researchers think they know why their analysis of water on these icy bodies posed such a conflict.The connection between those icycomets— which are called Jupiter-family comets because their orbits are affected byJupiter's gravitational influence — and Earth's water rests on a key molecular signature. That signature has to do with specific ratios of the hydrogen variant, or isotope, called deuterium. In general, ratios of deuterium to regular hydrogen in water give scientists a strong clue as to where that water formed. Typically, water with more deuterium is more likely to form in colder environments, which means water with higher levels of deuterium should have formed further away fromthe sun.For the last few decades, deuterium levels in water found in the vapor trails of several Jupiter-family comets displayed similar levels to that of Earth's water.You may like'Dark comets' may have given Earth its water long agoHow Did Earth Get Its Water? Scientists Now Look to 'Hyperactive' Comets for Clues""It was really starting to look like these comets played a major role in delivering water toEarth,"" Kathleen Mandt, a planetary scientist at NASA'sGoddard Space Flight Centersaidin a statement.But uncertainty was raised when theEuropean Space Agency's 2014 Rosetta mission to the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, or 67P for short,found higher concentrations of deuterium on any comet— about three times more deuterium than there is in Earth's oceans, which have roughly 1 deuterium atom for every 6,420 hydrogenatoms.""It was a big surprise and it made us rethink everything,"" Mandt said.Get the Space.com NewsletterBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to theTerms & ConditionsandPrivacy Policyand are aged 16 or over.A picture taken of Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko on March 25, a few days before Rosetta detected amino acid glycine in the comet's atmosphere (coma).(Image credit: ESA/Rosetta/NAVCAM – CC BY-SA IGO 3.0)But the story isn't over yet. Mandt and her team decided to revisit Rosetta's deuterium measurements of 67P, and through lab studies and comet observations, they found that cometary dust might be affecting the readings of the deuterium ratio that scientists observed in 67P's vapor.When comets pass closer to the sun during their orbit, their surfaces warm up, which can release gas and dust from the comet's surface. Water with deuterium sticks to dust grains more readily than regular water does, and when ice clinging to the dust grains is released into the vapor trail of a comet, it could give observers the impression that the water in the comet is more deuterium-rich than it actually is.""So, I was just curious if we could find evidence for that happening at 67P,"" Mandt said.

Every few years it's a complete 180 on whether coffee is bad for you or not.Over the last year or so, I have read a few articles saying it's unlikely comets brought Earths water, and it was more likely that the rocks the planet is made from contained water and that it rose to the surface over the evolution of the planet.It's getting to the point one doesn't know what to believe.ReplyTorbjorn LarssonIt is certainly possible, the question remains open.“The results of the experiments summarized in this work, focused on surface bombardment with hydrogen atoms, clearly confirm the theory of the interaction of excited hydrogen or deuterium Rydberg atoms and ions with the surface oxygens of oxide minerals,” the authors explain. “Our experiments attempt to explain the origin of water in the areas of oxygen-containing solid material (e.g., dust, meteoroids, asteroids, comets) exposed to a stream of charged particles close to a parent star.”Earth’s atmosphere and magnetosphere shield it from the solar wind, so there’s no way the wind could’ve created water right on Earth’s surface. However, as the study shows, the wind can create water on the surface of other bodies like asteroids, and the water can be adsorbed and held firm, then delivered to Earth via impacts.“This scenario is also applicable to the origin of water on Earth,” the authors write. “Due to this effect, a water molecule can be adsorbed on the surface of oxygen-containing particles and then transported over long distances and times,” the researchers write.This study won’t be the end of the ongoing effort to account for Earth’s water. In a fascinating roundabout way, this research brings us back to asteroids and meteorites delivering Earth’s water.https://www.universetoday.com/168998/did-some-of-earths-water-come-from-the-solar-wind/Mergatroidsaid:It's getting to the point one doesn't know what to believe.Alas, click bait 'answers' and fast food delivery answers is not what science serves up.On the contrary, the nature of open questions implies that we can trust the scientific process and the eventual result (if any). Ironically, the longer the question remains open, the more trust we should get (and give).Sure, it can test our patience. But adults are generally good at handling delays of gratification. it's part of life.ReplyAdelThe presence of water on Earth is not due to comets, but rather is the result of a great event that is considered the largest event in the solar system. This event was the reason for the presence of water and life on Earth. A collision occurred between the Earth and the Moon, which resulted in the Earth gaining crust from the near side of the Moon. This acquired crust is the reason for the existence of the lunar seas and the continents of the Earth. This collision resulted in the existence of water and life on Earth. Because of the water and the acquired crust that contains the elements necessary for life found in the lunar soil, the lunar seas are considered the geological form of the ancient continents of the Earth, and the continents of the Earth are the geological form of the lunar seas. This scientific result will be a scientific and geological explanation for a number of unanswered scientific questions about the moon and the earth, as I will explain through what I wrote today in the forum. This scientific result will also reveal a number of the moon’s mysterious secrets, as well as change and correct a number of prevailing scientific concepts. It will also reveal the origin of the moon and the biggest event in the solar system.ReplyView All 3 CommentsMost PopularAxiom's private space station is coming sooner than we thoughtWatch NASA's Artemis Orion moon spacecraft blow its top during testing (video)NASA Mars probe spies dusty, retired Insight lander from orbit (photo)Rocket Lab scrubs Strix radar satellite launch for Synspective over 'sensor data'Hubble's 'impossible' planet explained?

icy bodies posed such a conflictthe connection between those icycomets which are called jupiterfamily comets because their orbits are affected byjupiters gravitational influence and earths water rests on a key molecular signature that signature has to do with specific ratios of the hydrogen variant or isotope called deuterium in general ratios of deuterium to regular hydrogen in water give scientists a strong clue as to where that water formed typically water with more deuterium is more likely to form in colder environments which means water with higher levels of deuterium should have formed further away fromthe sunfor the last few decades deuterium levels in water found in the vapor trails of several jupiterfamily comets displayed similar levels to that of earths wateryou may

bysa igo but the story isnt over yet mandt and her team decided to revisit rosettas deuterium measurements of p and through lab studies and comet observations they found that cometary dust might be affecting the readings of the deuterium ratio that scientists observed in ps vaporwhen comets pass closer to the sun during their orbit their surfaces warm up which can release gas and dust from the comets surface water with deuterium sticks to dust grains more readily than regular water does and when ice clinging to the dust grains is released into the vapor trail of a comet it could give observers the impression that the water in the comet is more deuteriumrich than it actually isso i was just curious if we could find evidence for that happening at p mandt said and this is just one of

year or so i have read a few articles saying its unlikely comets brought earths water and it was more likely that the rocks the planet is made from contained water and that it rose to the surface over the evolution of the planetits getting to the point one doesnt know what to believereplytorbjorn larssonit is certainly possible the question remains openthe results of the experiments summarized in this work focused on surface bombardment with hydrogen atoms clearly confirm the theory of the interaction of excited hydrogen or deuterium rydberg atoms and ions with the surface oxygens of oxide minerals the authors explain our experiments attempt to explain the origin of water in the areas of oxygencontaining solid material eg dust meteoroids asteroids comets exposed to a stream of charged particles close to a parent starearths atmosphere and magnetosphere shield it from the solar wind so theres no way the wind couldve created water right on earths surface however as the study shows the wind can create water on the surface of other bodies like asteroids and the water can be adsorbed and held firm then delivered to earth via impactsthis scenario is also applicable to the origin of water on earth the authors write due to this effect a water molecule can be adsorbed on the surface of oxygencontaining particles and then transported over long distances and times the researchers writethis study wont be the end of the ongoing effort to account for earths water in a fascinating roundabout way this research brings us back to asteroids and meteorites delivering earths water getting to the point one doesnt know what to believealas click bait answers and fast food delivery answers is not what science serves upon the contrary the nature of open questions implies that we can trust the scientific process and the eventual result if any ironically the longer the question remains open the more trust we should get and givesure it can test our patience but adults are generally good at handling delays of gratification its part of lifereplyadelthe presence of water on earth is not due to comets but rather is the result of a great event that is considered the largest event in the solar system this event was the reason for the presence of water and life on earth a collision occurred between the earth and the moon which resulted in the earth gaining crust from the near side of the moon this acquired crust is the reason for the existence of the lunar seas and the continents of the earth this collision resulted in the existence of water and life on earth because of the water and the acquired crust that contains the elements necessary for life found in the lunar soil the lunar seas are considered the geological form of the ancient continents of the earth and the continents of the earth are the geological form of the lunar seas this scientific result will be a scientific and geological explanation for a number of unanswered scientific questions about the moon and the earth as i will explain through what i wrote today in the forum this scientific result will also reveal a number of the moons mysterious secrets as well as change and correct a number of

It reached more than 470,000 feet above Earth's surface and went ""hypersonic.""When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works.Afterschock II reached a maximum altitude of 470,000 feet above Earth's surface, which is higher than any other amateur rocket. Its nose cone then detached and deployed a parachute before falling back to Earth.(Image credit: USC Viterbi School of Engineering)A group of U.S. students has smashed a series of world records after launching a ""homemade"" rocket farther and faster into space than any other amateur rocket. The student-made missile soared 90,000 feet (27,400 meters) beyond the previous record-holder — a rocket launched more than 20 years ago.The record-breaking rocket, named Aftershock II, was designed and built by students at the University of Southern California's (USC) Rocket Propulsion Lab (RPL) — a group run entirely by undergraduate students. The students launched Aftershock II on Oct. 20 from a site in Black Rock Desert, Nevada. The rocket stood about 14 feet (4 meters) tall and weighed 330 pounds (150 kilograms).The rocket broke the sound barrier just two seconds after liftoff and reached its maximum speed roughly 19 seconds after launch, the RPL team wrote in aNov. 14 papersummarizing the launch. The rocket's engine then burned out, but the craft continued to climb as atmospheric resistance decreased, enabling it to leave Earth's atmosphere 85 seconds after launch and then reach its highest elevation, or apogee, 92 seconds later. At this point, the nose cone separated from the rest of the rocket and deployed a parachute so it could safely reenter the atmosphere and touch down in the desert, where it was collected by the RPL team for analysis.The rocket's apogee was around 470,000 feet (143,300 m) above Earth's surface, which is ""further into space than any non-governmental and non-commercial group has ever flown before,"" USC representatives wrote in astatement. The previous record of 380,000 feet (115,800 m) was set in 2004 by the GoFast rocket made by the Civilian Space Exploration Team.During the flight, Aftershock II reached a maximum speed of around 3,600 mph (5,800 km/h), or Mach 5.5 — five and a half times the speed of sound. This was slightly faster than GoFast, which had also held the amateur speed record for 20 years.Related:15 of the weirdest things we have launched into spaceUSC Student Rocket Group Shatters Amateur International Space Record - YouTubeWatch OnBut elevation and speed were not the only records Aftershock II broke. ""This achievement represents several engineering firsts,""Ryan Kraemer, an undergraduate mechanical engineering student at USC and executive engineer of the RPL team who will soon joinSpaceX's Starshipteam, said in the statement.

In 2019, another group became the first student-led team to launch a rocket past the Kármán line — the imaginary boundary where space officially begins, Live Science's sister siteSpace.com previously reported. Aftershock II is only the second student rocket ever to reach this milestone.To create their record-breaking rocket, the Aftershock II team used new advancements in thermal protection, which is critical when a rocket is traveling at hypersonic speeds (above Mach 5). The students coated Aftershock II in a new type of heat-resistant paint and equipped it with titanium-coated fins, which replaced carbon-based parts used on previous models.The Aftershock II project was run by a team of undergraduates from USC's Rocket Propulsion Lab.(Image credit: USC Viterbi School of Engineering)""Thermal protection at hypersonic speeds is a major challenge at the industry level,"" Kraemer said. The upgrades the team made ""performed perfectly, enabling the rocket to return largely intact."" However, the heating effect was so intense that the titanium fins turned from a silvery color to blue, due to a process known as ""anodization,"" in which the metal reacts with atmospheric oxygen to create a layer of titanium oxide, he added.The team also designed a new control unit for the rocket, known as High Altitude Module for Sensing, Telemetry, and Electronic Recovery (HASMTER), which tracked the rocket's flight and deployed its parachute.RELATED STORIES—Earth's new minimoon might be a rocket humans launched into space in the 1960s—'Lost' satellite finally found after orbiting undetected for 25 years—Weird balloon circling the Southern Hemisphere isn't a spy craft — it's NASA's newest telescopeThe researchers overseeing the RPL team were impressed with the students, who received minimal help from their teachers.""This is an exceptionally ambitious project not only for a student team, but for any non-professional group of rocket engineers,""Dan Erwin, an aerospace engineer and chair of the USC Department of Astronautical Engineering, said in the statement.

rocket broke the sound barrier just two seconds after liftoff and reached its maximum speed roughly  seconds after launch the rpl team wrote in anov  papersummarizing the launch the rockets engine then burned out but the craft continued to climb as atmospheric resistance decreased enabling it to leave earths atmosphere  seconds after launch and then reach its highest elevation or apogee

The antimatter particle is the partner of a massive matter particle called hyperhelium-4, and its discovery could help scientists tackle the mystery of why regular matter came to dominate the universe, despite the fact that matter and antimatter were created in equal amounts at thedawn of time.This imbalance is known as ""matter-antimatter asymmetry."" Matter particles and antimatter particles annihilate on contact, releasing their energy back into the cosmos. That implies that if an imbalance between the two hadn't arisenearly in the universe, then the cosmos may have been a much emptier and less interesting place indeed.The LHC is no stranger to paradigm-shifting discoveries about the early universe. Running in a 17-mile (27-kilometer) long loop beneath the Alps near Geneva, Switzerland, the LHC is most famous for its discovery of theHiggs Boson particle, the ""messenger"" of the Higgs Field responsible for giving other particles their mass at the dawn of time.You may likeHow the Large Hadron Collider's successor will hunt for the dark universeLarge Hadron Collider scientists hail most powerful collisions ever as detector gets back to workThe collisions that occur at the LHC generate a state of matter called ""quark-gluon plasma."" This dense sea of plasma is the same as the ""primordial soup"" of matter that filled the universe around one-millionth of a second afterthe Big Bang.Exotic ""hypernuclei"" and their antimatter counterparts emerge from this quark-gluon plasma, allowing scientists a glimpse at the conditions of the early universe.ALICE through the looking glassHypernuclei containprotonsandneutronslike ordinary atomic nuclei and also unstable particles called ""hyperons."" Like protons and neutrons, hyperons are composed of fundamental particles called ""quarks.""

However, they are rarely found in nature and are difficult to create and study in the lab. This has made them somewhat mysterious.An image of the ALICE detector taken during LHC upgrades in 2019(Image credit: Robert Lea)The discovery of the first evidence of the hypernuclei that is an antimatter counterpart of hyperhelium-4 was made at the LHC detector ALICE.While most of the nine experiments at the LHC, each with its own detector, generate their results by slamming together protons at near the speed of light, theALICE collaborationcreates quark-gluon plasma by slamming together much heavier particles, usually lead nuclei, or ""ions.""The collision of iron ions (try saying that ten times fast) is ideal for generating significant amounts of hypernuclei. Yet until recently, scientists conducting heavy-ion collisions had only succeeded in observing the lightest hypernucleus, hypertriton, and its antimatter partner, antihypertriton.That was until earlier in 2024 when scientists used theRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider(RHIC) in New York to detect antihyperhydrogen-4, which is composed of an antiproton, two antineutrons, and a quark-containing particle called an ""antilambda.""Now, ALICE has followed this with the detection of a heavier anti-hypernuclei particle, antihyperhelium-4, composed of two antiprotons, an antineutron, and an antilambda.An illustration of antimatter particles entering the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider.(Image credit: ORIGINS Cluster/S. Kwauka)The lead-lead collision and the ALICE data that yielded the detection of the heaviest antimatter hypernucleus yet at the LHC actually date back to 2018.The signature of antihyperhelium-4 was revealed by its decay into other particles and the detection of these particles.ALICE scientists teased the signature of antihyperhelium-4 out of the data using a machine-learning technique that can outperform the collaboration's usual search techniques.Related Stories:—How the antimatter-hunting Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer works (infographic)—How much of the universe is dark matter?—Stars made of antimatter could exist in the Milky WayIn addition to spotting evidence of antihyperhelium-4 and antihyperhydrogen-4, the ALICE team was also able to determine their masses, which were in good agreement with currentparticle physics theories.The scientists were also able to determine the amounts of these particles produced in lead-lead collisions.They found these numbers consistent with the ALICE data, which indicates that antimatter and matter are produced in equal amounts from quark-gluon plasma produced at the energy levels the LHC is capable of reaching.The reason for the universe's matter/antimatter imbalance remains unknown, but antihyperhelium-4 and antihyperhydrogen-4 could provide important clues in this mystery.Join our Space Forumsto keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

And that includes the possibility that the matter we see today was not created in a Big Band at all.I came to the comments to say something similar. The Big Bang model is good, and probably the best explanation for the evidence we have. However, we haven't really had enough evidence to treat it like it is essentially 100% certain. There has always been room for interpretation, for as long as we don't have answers to things like the matter-antimatter imbalance, higher frequency of stellar mergers than predicted, large galaxies/quasars only a few hundred million years after the predicted formation of the universe, the ""Lithium Problem"", the Final Parsec Problem, and the Hubble Tension. Add to that not yet having detected CMB B-Modes with any certainty, haven't found any unambiguous population III stars, nor confirmed Dark Matter is a new particle. Not to mention that we frankly have no idea what Dark Energy is beyond what we believe it does.None of these things invalidate the Big Bang Theory, but it's certainly enough for any practiced scientist to acknowledge uncertainty. Unfortunately, suggesting that any significant detail about the Big Bang is wrong--is career suicide. It's become a culture. Fortunately, JWST has finally cracked some of the cosmologists' resistance to acknowledging we don't know the BBT is 100% correct--and never had enough information to act like we did.As somebody with a graduate degree in aerospace engineering, I can understand what evidence we have for the BB--and I have never believed that we can treat it like a foregone conclusion, or even with so much as a 75% certainty. There are just too many assumptions about observed phenomena behaving how we expect it to--when we can't confirm that they do so on a cosmic scale. At some point, it becomes easier to explain the problems with other theories, than it does to come up with hot dark matter and primordial black holes to keep the 13.8 billion year old universe idea alive.As such, we really can't say ""despite the fact that matter and antimatter were created in equal amounts at the dawn of time"" --It's much too far from being something we can confirm, and if we don't observe equal amounts, that's just as much evidence for an anomaly with the Big Bang Theory--as it is evidence for the Big Bang Theory not correctly predicting how matter and antimatter formed.ReplyView All 2 CommentsMost PopularDouble moon mission!

""Maybe this could be another visualization to help increase that readiness.""Related:Safety first: NASA pledges to use AI carefully and responsiblyThe team trained amachine learningmodel called a conditional generative adversarial network, or GAN for short, which creates realistic images using two neural networks working against each other.The first network, called the ""generator,"" learns by studying real examples, likesatelliteimages of areas before and after a hurricane. The second network, the ""discriminator,"" acts as a critic, trying to tell apart the real images from the fake ones created by the generator.

This back-and-forth process aims to create synthetic images that are nearly identical to real ones.However, GANs sometimes produce ""hallucinations"" — features in the images that look real but are factually incorrect or shouldn't be there.""Hallucinations can mislead viewers,"" said Lütjens. ""We were thinking: How can we use these generative AI models in aclimate-impact setting, where having trusted data sources is so important?""That's where the physics model comes in.To demonstrate their model's credibility, the researchers applied it to a scenario for Houston, generating satellite images of flooding in the city following a storm comparable in strength toHurricane Harvey, which actually hit in 2017. They then compared their AI-generated images to actual satellite images, as well as images created without the assistance of the physics-flood model.Not surprisingly, without the aid of the physics model, the AI images were highly inaccurate, with numerous ""hallucinations"" — specifically, the images depicting flooding in regions where it would not be physically possible. But the physics-reinforced method's images were comparable to the real-world scenario.The scientists envision that this tech should be most applicable to predicting the outcomes of future flooding scenarios by producing trustworthy visuals to help policymakers better prepare for and make informed decisions about flood planning, evacuation and mitigation efforts.In their press release, the scientists say that policymakers typically gauge where flooding might occur based on visualizations in the form of color-coded maps.""The question is: Can visualizations of satellite imagery add another level to this, that is a bit more tangible and emotionally engaging than a color-coded map of reds, yellows and blues, while still being trustworthy?"" Lütjens said.RELATED STORIES:—How satellite data has proven climate change is a climate crisis—Satellite images capture Hurricane Milton intensifying into Category 5 storm (videos)—Hurricane Milton forces NASA, SpaceX to delay Crew-8 astronauts' return to EarthThis is an important example of how space-based technology can help in managing the unfoldingclimate crisis, which is making extreme events, like flooding and hurricanes, more likely.The team's method is still in the proof-of-concept stage and needs more time to ""study"" other regions to be able to predict the outcomes of different storms. This will require further training on many more real-world scenarios.""We show a tangible way to combine machine learning with physics for a use case that's risk-sensitive, which requires us to analyze the complexity of Earth's systems and project future actions and possible scenarios to keep people out of harm's way,"" said Dava Newman, professor of AeroAstro and director of the MIT Media Lab.

Smithpublished19 December 2024""The moment when we first looked at the MERTIS flyby data and could immediately distinguish impact craters was breathtaking!""Comments(0)When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works.This greyscale part of this image shows the first-ever measurement by a spacecraft of how Mercury radiates in mid-infrared light. It was measured by the MERTIS instrument on the ESA/JAXABepiColombomission on 1 December 2024, as the spacecraft flew past the planetfor the fifth time.(Image credit: MERTIS/DLR/University of Münster & NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Carnegie Institution of Washington)BepiColombo just imaged Mercury in a whole new light — mid-infrared light, to be precise.On the spacecraft's fifth flyby ofMercuryearlier this month (out of a planned six flybys) BepiColombo pointed its Mercury Radiometer and Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (MERTIS) at a swath of Mercury's northern hemisphere. Mid-infrared light is invisible to human eyes, but it carries a wealth of information about the mineral makeup and temperature of very hot rocks like those on Mercury's sun-baked surface. The Dec. 1 flyby marked the firsttimescientists have ever seen Mercury's surface in mid-infrared wavelengths, and the new view reveals some tantalizing hints about the planet's geology.BepiColomboswooped past Mercury at a distance of 37,626 kilometers(about 23,400 miles) on Dec. 1. The most recent flyby isn't the spacecraft's closest encounter with Mercury;that happened on Sept. 4, when the spacecraft skimmed just 165 kilometers (103 miles) above Mercury's battered, scorched surface. When BepiColombo settles into orbit around Mercury in late 2026, it will pass within 590 kilometers (370 miles) of the planet at its closest point before swinging back out to 11,640 kilometers (7,230 miles). But to get there, the spacecraft has taken a spiraling route through the innersolar system, using the gravitational tug ofEarth(once),Venus(twice), and Mercury (six times) to get itself on the right course at the right speed to end up in orbit around Mercury.Those six Mercury flybys, the last of which will happen in January 2025, together offer researchers a chance to test out the spacecraft's instruments and gather scientific data that will help them refine their plan for the science BepiColombo will do while in orbit. One of the big questions scientists hope to answer about Mercury in the coming years is exactly what its surface is made of — and what that tells us about how the planet formed and evolved so perilously close to the sun’s heat andgravity. MERTIS is the instrument they hope will shed new (mid-infrared) light on that subject, because most of the minerals that combine to form rocks tend to radiate brightly in the mid-infrared wavelengths when they're very hot.You may likeBepiColombo spacecraft's flyby of Mercury begins unraveling the planet's magnetic mysteryWatch Mercury roll by as BepiColombo probe makes superclose flyby (video)For the last two decades, MERTIS's science team has heated minerals, and combinations of minerals, to more than 400 degrees Celsius (752 degrees Fahrenheit) in the lab, then measured the mid-infrared radiation they emit. The result is a database of glowing fingerprints for several minerals, which the science team can compare to the MERTIS data to identify what different patches of Mercury's surface are made of, how hot they are, and how rough the terrain is.""Because Mercury's surface is surprisingly poor in iron, we have been testing natural and synthetic minerals that lack iron,"" said Solmaz Adeli of the German Aerospace Center, project lead for the latest flyby,in a statement. ""The materials tested include rock-forming minerals to simulate what Mercury's surface might be made of.""The latest flyby, MERTIS's first chance to shine, captured a swath of Mercury's northern hemisphere, including part of a wide volcanic plain and part of the Caloris Basin: a rocky plain inside a large impact crater, which, on every other orbit, passes directly beneaththe sunwhile Mercury is at its closest point to our star. These images also contain a striking view of Bashō Crater, an impact crater previously photographed by the Mariner 10 (1974-1975) and Messenger (2011-2015) spacecraft.Get the Space.com NewsletterBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to theTerms & ConditionsandPrivacy Policyand are aged 16 or over.RELATED STORIES:—Japanese-European spacecraft bound for Mercury weakened by thruster glitch—BepiColombo probe captures stunning Mercury images in closest flyby yet—European probe captures stunning up-close views of planet Mercury during brief flyby (video, photos)""The moment when we first looked at the MERTIS flyby data and could immediately distinguish impact craters was breathtaking!"" said Adeli. ""There is so much to be discovered in this dataset – surface features that have never been observed in this way before are waiting for us.""From more than 37,600 kilometers (23,363 miles) away, MERTIS was able to image Mercury's surface with a relatively low resolution of 26 kilometers to 30 kilometers (16 miles to 19 miles) — enough to give the science team a broad overview, but not much detail about the planet's rocky geological history. Once BepiColombo finally settles into orbit, MERTIS will map the whole surface at a resolution of 500 meters (547 yards).Join our Space Forumsto keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov approaches the International Space Station as it orbited 261 miles above Ontario, Canada, near James Bay.NASA published a new report Thursday highlighting 17 agency mechanisms that have directly and indirectly supported the development and growth of the U.S. commercial space sector for the benefit of humanity.The report, titledEnabling America on the Space Frontier: The Evolution of NASA’s Commercial Space Development Toolkit, is available on the agency’s website.“This is the most extensive and comprehensive historical analysis produced by NASA on how it has contributed to commercial space development over the decades,” said Alex MacDonald, NASA chief economist. “These efforts have given NASA regular access to space with companies, such as SpaceX and Rocket Lab, modernizing our communications infrastructure, and even led to the first private lunar lander thanks to Intuitive Machines. With commercial space growth accelerating, this report can help agency leaders and stakeholders assess the numerous mechanisms that the agency uses to support this growth, both now and in the future.”Throughout its history, NASA has supported the development of the commercial space sector, not only leading the way in areas such as satellite communications, launch, and remote sensing, but also developing new contract and operational models to encourage commercial participation and growth. In the last three decades, NASA has seen the results of these efforts with commercial partners able to contribute more to missions across NASA domains, and increasingly innovative agency-led efforts to engage, nurture, and integrate these capabilities. These capabilities support the agency’s mission needs, and have seen a dramatic rise in importance, according to the report.NASA has nurtured technology, companies, people, and ideas in the commercial space sector, contributing to the U.S. and global economies, across four distinct periods in the agency’s history:1915–1960: NASA’s predecessor, the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA), and NASA’s pre-Apollo years.1961–1980: Apollo era.1981–2010: Space shuttle era.2011–present: Post-shuttle commercial era.Each of these time periods are defined by dominant technologies, programs, or economic trends further detailed in the report.Though some of these mechanisms are relatively recent, others have been used throughout the history of NASA and NACA, leading to some overlap. The 17 mechanisms are as follows:Contracts and Partnership AgreementsResearch and Technology Development (R&TD)Dissemination of Research and Scientific DataEducation and Workforce DevelopmentWorkforce External Engagement and MobilityTechnology TransferTechnical SupportEnabling InfrastructureLaunchDirect In-Space SupportStandards and Regulatory Framework SupportPublic EngagementIndustry EngagementVenture Capital EngagementMarket Stimulation FundingEconomic Analysis and Due Diligence CapabilitiesNarrative EncouragementNASA supports commercial space development in everything from spaceflight to supply chains. Small satellite capabilities have inspired a new generation of space start-ups, while new, smaller rockets, as well as new programs are just starting. Examples include CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Services), commercial low Earth orbit destinations, human landing systems, commercial development of NASA spacesuits, and lunar terrain vehicles. The report also details many indirect ways the agency has contributed to the vibrance of commercial space, from economic analyses to student engagement.The agency’s use of commercial capabilities has progressed from being the exception to the default method for many of its missions. The current post-shuttle era of NASA-supported commercial space development has seen a level of technical development comparable to the Apollo era’s Space Race. Deploying the 17 commercial space development mechanisms in the future are part of NASA’s mission to continue encouraging commercial space activities.To learn more about NASA’s missions, please

DirectorMike Cheslikthen painstakingly constructed his absurd slapstick fever dream about an applejack salesman turned fur trapper (Ryland Brickson Cole Tews, who also co-wrote thefilm) by processing over 1,500 shots in Adobe After Effects. It is proof that if you can get your hands on $150,000, create a detailed shot list, and bribe some friends with alcohol, you can make a goddamn motion picture.Related StoriesA Goofier ‘Blade Runner,’ ‘Trancers’ (1984) Delivers a Very Techno-Thriller Christmas with Helen HuntCan the ‘Sing Sing’ Pay Equity Model Help Solve Indie Film’s Woes?But as much as “Hundreds of Beavers” seems like a handmade homage to the greats of silent comedy, the movieisn’tsilent. Much of its humor comes out of the work by sound designer Bobb Barito to make the film feel just as much of a Nintendo side-scroller as it does a Buster Keaton setpiece. Thesound designgives even the most absurd gags weight, momentum, and a character of their own. And in true “Hundreds of Beavers” fashion, Barito found that he fashioned the best sound effects out of wood.“Everything in this movie’s pretty wooden. Wood is definitely really funny, especially when you distort it, there’s like a hollowness to it,” Barito told IndieWire. He tested out a bunch of different options (and the Amazon Prime returns policy) but found that wooden kazoos, wooden clapper toys, and other wooden contraptions all were the perfect matches for key, repeated sounds throughout “Hundreds of Beavers.” (Kazoos for the flies that hapless trapper Jean Kayak uses as bait; the clapper toys for a chattering sound perfect for sled dogs afraid of wolves; and the wooden puzzle for the beavers’ centrifuge in their rocket lab — seriously, this movie is wild.)Even when the goal was for something to sound canned and slightly video game or “Looney Tunes” in character, Barito tried to create original sounds that he could customize, stretch, and exaggerate for the exact comedic effect needed. There’s cartoon violence lurking behind almost every sequence in “Hundreds of Beavers” and amping up and distorting the sound quality of that violence is what makes those jokes really land.‘Hundreds of Beavers’Courtesy Everett Collection“Violence sounds funniest when it’s really distorted,” Barito said. “[Distortion makes effects] sound dated and when things sound dated, even if you’re watching an old movie and it’s not supposed to be funny, sometimes the sound is a little goofy. But also distortion just makes it seem gigantic, a lot bigger than it actually is. It amplifies the gravity of the situation.”Barito’s work helps the film’s comedy live in between the exaggerated sonic landscape and the consciously limited visuals. It’s that combination, the disconnect between sound and image, that gets “Hundreds of Beavers” to feel like more of a live-action cartoon than anything Disney has done in the last decade. Barito’s methods for creating that distortion are pretty resourceful, too.“If a body [fell], I would run it through a tape deck and just distort it. Tape actually adds a really nice sounding saturation that colors the sound in a cool way. So all the body falls and punches and all that stuff was distorted through a tape deck to give a retro feel and make it sound more hilarious,” Barito said.Barito worked on establishing the key sound effects while Cheslik was still locking the picture edit, which helped finesse some of the timing and some of the impact the sound would have in advance of the nine months that Barito perfected thesound designand the mix. “Mike’s philosophy was, ‘What’s the funniest possible thing we should do, and if it breaks a rule, we should still do it,’” Barito said.‘Hundreds of Beavers’Courtesy Everett CollectionIt perhaps wasn’t as massive a challenge as dismantling an orchard to build a Beaver space program, but Barito needed to calibrate which key sounds would lead the audience and how and where the sound would land. But he also had a kind of freedom that live-action films don’t usually offer sound designers.“There’s a lot of creativity involved in every square inch of the movie. So every single second involved not just work, but experimentation and an exploration of ‘what is the funniest possible sound at any given time?’” Barito said. “And it was really fun to do scenes in 5.1 [surround sound], too. I’m not bound by production sound so I can move anything wherever I want to. It’s one of those movies where things will happen and I’m not afraid to put [a sound] behind you just to add to the experience.”As much as Cheslik’s big and obvious visual effects, Chris Ryan’s sledgehammer score, and Tews’s Yukon-sized reactions, the sound helps guide the audience’s focus through the most chaotic and absurd of sequences. Barito told IndieWire that the fast, furious sled chase towards the end of the film was an example of a broad comedy sequence that’s timed very carefully so the score trades off with sound effects to drive the scene’s momentum.“When you’re watching a movie, you really only want to be focusing on one thing at a time,” Barito said. “[The chase] is a gigantic action scene. There’s a whole lot of stuff going on. So my first pass of that had the music pretty low and Mike kept wanting me to bump it up. But the more you bumped up the music, the more chaotic it would get. I had to find the moments where the music could come up and be the main character and then come back down when the sound effects were more center stage.”It’s a credit to Barito, however, that the sound effects neverfeelcenter stage; the slapstick does.“Hundreds of Beavers” is available to stream on YouTube.Read More:FilmHundreds of BeaversMike CheslikSound DesignTop of the LineDaily HeadlinesDaily Headlines covering Film, TV and more.SubscribeMore from IndieWirewho's winning?Everything to Remember from ‘Squid Game’ Season 1Reporting LiveTo Get the Details Right, the Production Design of ‘September 5’ Had to Bring Old Tech Back to LifeScreen TalkIn the Photorealistic ‘Mufasa,’ What’s Lost Is Imagination — and FunGetting Animated‘Mufasa: The Lion King’ Director Barry Jenkins Gets Biblical on His Virtual Production Roller-Coaster RideDeep Dive‘The Substance’: The Cinematic Metamorphosis of Elisabeth SparkleInterviewAyo Edebiri Says Directing ‘The Bear’ Was Like ‘Making a Venn Diagram Out of a Thousand Circles’Daily HeadlinesDaily Headlines covering Film, TV and more.Email address to subscribe to newsletter.SubscribeBy providing your information, you agree to ourTerms of Useand ourPrivacy Policy.

A compilation video offers a look at 2024 highlights in such areas of work as propulsion testing, autonomous systems, range operations, community outreach, and STEM engagement.NASA’s Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, celebrated propulsion testing and site operations milestones in 2024, all while inspiring the Artemis Generation and welcoming new leadership that will help NASA Stennis innovate and grow into the future.Featured highlights show a year of progress and vision, as NASA Stennis accelerates the exploration and commercialization of space, innovates to benefit NASA and industry, and leverages assets to grow as an impactful aerospace and technology hub.“These highlights are just a small snapshot of 2024 at NASA Stennis that show the future is bright,” Bailey said. “We have an incredibly talented and committed team of employees – and all of Mississippi can be proud of the work they do here at NASA Stennis. Together, with the Artemis Generation leading the way, we are returning to the Moon. Together, we are a part of something great.”New Center LeadershipNASA Stennis Director John Bailey, right, and NASA Stennis Deputy Director Christine Powell stand near the United States Capitol during a visit to Washington, D.C. on Sept. 18. It marked the first visit to Capitol Hill for the center leaders since being named to their current roles.NASA/StennisNASA Administrator Bill Nelson named John Bailey as director of NASA Stennis inApril. Bailey had been serving as acting director since January 2024. “So much of NASA runs through Stennis,” said Nelson. “It is where we hone new and exciting capabilities in aerospace, technology, and deep space exploration. I am confident that John will lead the nation’s largest and premier propulsion test site to even greater success.”Four months later inAugust, Bailey announced that longtime propulsion engineer/manager Christine Powell had been selected as deputy director of NASA Stennis.Powell, the first woman selected as NASA Stennis deputy director, began her 33-year agency career as an intern at the center in 1991.

We make technology sexy!Main menuSkip to contentHomeStoreCosplayComicsAboutT-ShirtsSUPPORT USHuman settlement of Mars isn’t as far off as you might thinkFrame Stock Footage / ShutterstockSam McKee,Manchester Metropolitan UniversityCould humans expand out beyond their homeworld and establish settlements on the planet Mars? The idea of settling the red planet has beenaround for decades. However, it has been seen by sceptics as a delusion at best and mere bluster at worst.Mars might seem superficiallysimilar to Earthin a number of ways. But its atmosphere is thin and humans would need to livewithin pressurised habitatson the surface.Yet in an era where space tourism has become possible, the red planet has emerged as a dreamland for rich eccentrics and techno utopians. As is often the case with science communication, there’s a gulf between how close we are to this ultimate goal and where the general public understands it to be.However, I believe there is a rationale for settling Mars and that this objective is not as far off as some would believe. There are actually a few good reasons to be optimistic about humanity’s future on the red planet.First, Mars is reachable. During an optimal alignment between Earth and Mars as the two planets orbit the Sun, its possible to travel there in a spacecraft insix to eight months. Some very interesting new engine designs suggest that it could be done in two months. But based on technology that’s ready to go, it would take astronauts six months to travel to Mars and six months back to Earth.Astronauts havealready stayedfor this long on the International Space Station (ISS) and on the Soviet orbiting lab Mir. We can get there safely and we have already shown that we can reliably land robots on the surface. There’s no technical reason why we couldn’t do the same with humans.Second, Marsis abundantin theraw materialsrequired for humans to “live off the land”, in other words, achieve a level of self sufficiency. The red planet has plentiful carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen which can be separated and isolated, using processes developed on Earth. Mars is interesting and useful in a multitude of ways that the moon isn’t. And we have technology on Earth to enable us to stay and settle Mars by making use of its materials.A third reason for Mars optimism is the radical new technology that we can put to use on a crewed mission to the planet. For example,Moxie(Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment) is an project developed by scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) that sucks in Martian atmosphere andseparates it into oxygen. Byproducts of the process – carbon monoxide, nitrogen and argon – can be vented.When scaled up, similar machines would be able to separate oxygen from hydrogen to produce breathable air, rocket fuel and water. This makes it easier to travel to the planet and live on the surface because it’s not necessary to bring these commodities from Earth – they can be made once on Mars. Generating fuel on the surface would also make any future habitat less reliant on electric or solar-powered vehicles.But how would we build the habitats for our Mars settlers? Space architect Melodie Yasherhas developedingenious plans for using robots to 3D print the habitats, landing pads and everything needed for human life on Mars. Using robots means that these could all be manufactured on Mars before humans landed. 3D printed homes have already been demonstrated on Earth.Volunteers have also spent time living in simulated Mars habitats here on Earth. These are known as Mars analogues. The emergency medicine doctor Beth Healey spent a year overwintering in Antarctica (which offers many parallels with living on another planet) for the European Space Agency (Esa) andcommunicates her experienceregularly.She is not alone, as each year sees new projects in caves, deserts and other extreme environments, where long term studies can explore the physical and psychological demands on humans living in such isolated environments.Finally, theMars Direct plandevised by Dr Robert Zubrin has existed for more than 30 years, and has been modified to account for modern technology as the private sector has grown. The original plan was based on using a Saturn V rocket (used for the Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s) to launch people. However, this can now be accomplished using the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and a SpaceX Dragon capsule to carry crew members.Elon Musk wants to use his Starship vehicle to establish large settlements on Mars.SpaceX,CC BY-NCSeveral uncrewed launches from Earth could ferry necessary equipment to Mars. These could include a vehicle for crew members to return on. This means that everything could be ready for the first crew once they arrived.For astronauts making the journey to Mars, radiation is the biggest problem. But using certainmaterials in the wallsof the spacecraft or building a protective shelter inside the vehicle could shield astronauts from high energy particles. Similar ideas could apply to 3D printed habitats on the Martian surface. Alternatively, settlers could live underground or in Martian caves.On Mars, there’s a 24-minute communication delay with Earth. This means that Martians will need to be self-sustaining and less reliant on their homeworld from the beginning. While this could pose challenges, they are not insurmountable.Elon Musk’sStarship vehicle, which launches on the most powerful rocket ever built, could be a game changer. Starship is currently undergoing testing at SpaceX’s facility in southern Texas. It is hard to overstate what a reliable Starship, that has been cleared to carry humans, could do for exploration of the moon and Mars.Lower costs, higher payloads and larger crews all make for a far more efficient programme of lunar and Martian exploration. Yet even without it, everything we need to travel to Mars is currently available or in exciting late stages of development. There will not be a shortage of well-suited astronauts eager to go.Sam McKee, Associate Tutor and PhD Candidate in Philosophy of Science,Manchester Metropolitan UniversityThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

Let's pray that the season finale makes a second outing irresistible for the studio.With Valya's ruse last week in ""Twice Born,"" with Baron Harrow Harkonnen failing to finger Emperor Corrino for Pruwet Richese's death and Keiran Atreides' conspirators roasted alive by Desmond Hart, things are looking grim for the Harkonnen family's future prospects, especially with angry Uncle Evgeny dead and pompous Harrow being ridiculed for his weak sauce performance at the Landsraad High Council.And down deep in the catacombs of the Sisterhood's home on Wallach IX, Tula’s Frankenstein-like experiment to use the Anirulthinking machinewith a sprinkling of spice to resurrect Lila has succeeded, as we saw the young girl alive again and her striking blue eyes saturated by the spice known as melange like the native Fremen of Arrakis.Onward to the fifth revelation-filled episode titled ""In Blood, Truth,"" beginning with a very different sort of reunion as Emperor Corrino receives a guest in the form of Sister Francesca, Javicco's former lover and Constantine's mom, who's played by the beautiful Bollywood legend Tabu. This confidant of Valya's inner circle shows up to secure her son's future by convincing the Emperor to allow him to direct the royal fleet despite his having essentially no experience for the job whatsoever.You may likeNew 'Dune: Prophecy' trailer unveils the prequel series' grand scope (video)'Dune: Prophecy' 'Twice Born' — Plans go awry, people die, and what's behind those blue eyes?Desmond Hart, being given credit for saving the Landsraad from the hunter-seeker bomb, attends a formal ceremony bestowing upon him the title of Bashar, leader of the Emperor’s elite guard to defend the Imperium's values ""with ferocity and pride.""A spaceship cruises over Emperor Javicco Corrino's homeworld(Image credit: HBO/Max)Over at the Sisterhood, Sister Jen (Faoileann Cunningham) speaks out regarding the students' nightmares invading their minds, frustrated that they're being given no explanation as to the meaning of the blue machine eyes that watch from the darkness. Tula scolds her in front of Mother Avila and the acolytes but has bigger plans for the outspoken member of the special school due to Jen's intelligence, strength, and resistance to the doomsday dreams.She's asked to accompany Tula into the catacombs under strict confidentiality, where she's shown Anirul and the crazed possessed Lila.

Raquella, speaking via Lila, needs to know how Kasha died and uses a slice of her brainstem to investigate, discovering a damaging viral enzyme in the fear center of Kasha's brain.Back at the palace, Harrow comes slinking back to offer an apology for his misguided accusations and to gain favor with Desmond Hart, who instantly sees Harrow as a pawn to be used to ferret out info on the relationship between the Sisterhood, spice trade, and the rebellion.Valya, in full manipulative mode, meets with Francesca to reveal that the Sisterhood has been sidelined after Kasha's death and that the Emperor has refused a new truthsayer. She needs her help to guide the Emperor back to the Sisterhood while she distracts Desmond Hart and his new police dogs. Fortifying her defenses even further, she encourages Harrow to get cozy with Hart to help House Harkonnen, but he's more than apprehensive and for good reason. Valya has gone over the edge!Keiran Atreides is arrested for treason by the palace guards(Image credit: HBO/Max)Swordmaster Keiran Atreides, the infiltrating resistance rebel, warns Mikaela that Hart is hunting for insurgents, but she's got a sack of portable explosives and she aims to use them. When Desmond Hart and his goons arrive to shake her down for information on spice smuggling, he needles her on her Fremen heritage before trashing her outpost, while upstairs, Keiran plants the bombs.In a much appreciated action sequence, Keiran gets to display his sword skills by dispatching Hart's soldiers while trying to escape before the explosives detonate. Desmond Hart finds Mikaela's black Sisterhood robe upstairs amid spice containers when the bombs go kaboom and Keiran And Mikaela get free of the building. But Keiran recognizes Mikaela's distinctive knife and confronts her about secretly working for the Sisterhood. Hart miraculously survives the explosions by activating his body shield at the last second and he walks out, ""Terminator""-style.In a quiet moment, Francesca reminds Constantine of his purpose to protect his sister Princess Ynez, the future ruler of the Imperium. Summoning the courage to snoop, he finds Keiran's 3D hologram map of the palace layout in the training room and has him arrested when he strolls in after the outpost explosion and fire.Finally, a contingency arrives on Wallach IX with Desmond Hart's blood sample. Tula runs it through Anirul's genetic library and a direct match is found. His mother was a Sister! And for an even better twist, Tula's devastated reaction hints at him being the abandoned love child of her and Orry Atreides, as Desmond partially relates to a seductive Empress Natalya in a cross-cut scene. These are some messed up families!Empress Natalya (Jodhi May) vows to eradicate the Sisterhood with Desmond Hart (Travis Fimmel)(Image credit: HBO/Max)What will happen when Constantine's newly-awarded Imperial fleet is deployed to Arrakis to bring stability to House Corrino?

They've detected the most energetic cosmic electrons ever observed, unlocking new avenues in our understanding of the universe.""Cosmic rays are a century-old mystery,"" Mathieu de Naurois, a researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and deputy director of the H.E.S.S. collaboration, told Space.com.First reported in 1912 by Austrian physicist Victor Hess,cosmic rayswere discovered after a series of balloon ascents meant to explore ionizing radiation that was first detected on an electroscope. However, after reaching an altitude of 5,300 meters, Hess unveiled a natural source of high-energy particles fromspace. Today, we call those particles cosmic rays.Now, H.E.S.S. scientists are excited because they’ve detected thehighest energyelectronsand positrons to date (a positron is like the ""opposite"" of an electron because it has the mass of an electron, but is positively charged like aproton), which make up one component of high-energy cosmic rays.The finding is exciting because it provides tangible evidence of extreme cosmic processes unleashing colossal amounts of energy.You may likeMysterious Cosmic Rays Leave Scientists in the DarkHigh-energy cosmic rays may originate within the Milky Way galaxyRelated:Earth got hammered by cosmic rays 41,000 years ago due to a weak magnetic field""Understanding these cosmic rays allows us to unveil big particle accelerators inthe universethat are often associated with the most violent phenomena: the explosion ofstars; very compact objects with huge gravitational and electromagnetic fields, such as neutron stars andpulsars; cataclysmic mergers; andblack holes,"" said de Naurois.The cool part is, because electrons at this energy lose energy quickly, the team believes they must be coming from relatively nearby. ""In the vicinity of oursolar system, there [are] very efficient cosmic accelerators of electrons,"" de Naurois said. ""Within a few hundredlight-years, there are many stars, with the nearest ones typically lying two light-years from theEarth. We would therefore also expect to have a few ‘dead stars’ in this region, such as pulsars orsupernovaremnants, which could be the sources of these electrons.""Get the Space.com NewsletterBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to theTerms & ConditionsandPrivacy Policyand are aged 16 or over.Detecting these high energy electrons and positrons with energies of several teraelectronvolts — higher than any particle accelerators on Earth are able to achieve — has been particularly challenging for a couple of reasons.Firstly, galactic magnetic fields cause electrons to deviate from a straight path, arriving on Earth from seemingly random directions. Secondly, space-based instruments are too small to capture enough of these particles, partly due to the particles' uneven energy distribution in space.In other words, cosmic ray sources accelerate particles gradually, with higher-energy particles being more likely to escape their systems. Because reaching the highest energies takestime, this leads to an abundance of low-energy particles and progressively fewer particles at higher energy levels. ""At high energies, the cosmic ray flux falls rapidly, meaning space instruments collect too few of them,"" de Naurois explained.On the other hand, however, ground-based telescopes that detect cosmic rays indirectly have a difficult time differentiating cosmic ray electrons from countless other types of cosmic rays bombardingEarth's atmosphere.""H.E.S.S., in contrast, has a huge effective area, making it particularly suitable to study the high energy part of the electron spectrum,"" de Naurois said.The H.E.S.S. Observatory, consisting of five large telescopes spread across an area of about the size of a football field, was designed to capture atmospheric showers that emit Cherenkov radiation. This radiation occurs when high-energy particles collide with the Earth's atmosphere, creating particle showers that the telescopes can detect and analyze.Artist's impression of a pulsar with its powerful magnetic field rotating around it. The clouds of charged particles moving along the field lines emit gamma rays that are focused by the magnetic fields, rather like the beams of light from a lighthouse. In these magnetic fields, pairs of positrons and electrons are created and accelerated, making pulsars potential sources of high-energy cosmic electrons and positrons.(Image credit: NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Conceptual Image Lab)Though its main purpose is to detectgamma raysand find their sources, the team repurposed the data to search for these high energy cosmic ray electrons. ""The algorithm used here is based on a pixel-by-pixel comparison, using sophisticated statistical modeling — specifically likelihood analysis — between a pre-calculated model and the images recorded by the camera,"" said de Naurois.Originally, the algorithm was adapted to detect electrons, which are subtly different from gamma rays. They also had to be able to differentiate the electrons from background signals. And, because electrons are rare in the data, the algorithm had to be adjusted to reject other cosmic ray particles by applying stricter criteria, but this also resulted in fewer electrons being detected.To improve accuracy, ""every telescope observation was thoroughly simulated, providing a deeper understanding of how the instruments behave,"" said de Naurois.This resulted in an unparalleled set of statistical data for analyzing cosmic-ray electrons. The team confirmed that the electron energy spectrum extends up to at least 40 TeV, which is 400 times higher than the energy-detection capabilities of Earth-based accelerators. A sharp ""break"" in the spectrum around 1 TeV indicates that electrons at this energy lose energy rapidly within theMilky Way, suggesting, as de Naurois stated, that they originate from relatively nearby sources.""The sharpness of this break implies that only a few, or possibly just one, cosmic source is responsible for these electrons,"" he added.

Still a far cry from the Lorentz factor of the Oh-My-God particle, which - assuming it was a proton - was an insane 3.2\00d710^11.ReplyClassical MotionImpressive numbers. I don’t accept the Lorentz factor as such. Only a portion of that energy is related to velocity. I think one could have a dozen electrons, at the same speed, with different energy levels.The rotational energy(rest mass) of the electron comes from the rate of acceleration.Rest mass increases with acceleration, not velocity.The ratio of rest momentum to kinetic momentum depends on acceleration.Just a supposition.Interaction has at least two rates. Velocity of stimulus. And rate of transfer from that velocity. Which depends on density and duration.Think of velocity as having a ramp. That slope, that rate, has an acceleration. And acceleration riding on that velocity.That ramp’s slope can be change with acceleration.And by the way. Acceleration could not occur without a constant time and constant length.Just some more hayseed supposition.We are bound with intellect, not time and space.ReplyMHFI was not aware of any stars (burning or dark) 2 lightyears from the solar system.

The apparent mass increases with speed not acceleration although if you are accelerated you do feel heavier!ReplyClassical MotionThe only accelerator I’ve read about is Sol. It emits a particle flux which is accelerated for weeks and months out past Neptune. No one knows where this acceleration ends or where this flux goes.Electrons and positrons can be accelerated at a faster rate than protons, because of inertia. And the solar wind acceleration doesn’t seem to depend on the inertia. Solar particle flux is 50/50 electrons and protons. The acceleration has an anti-gravity characteristic. And the acceleration is clear across our solar system, NOT a point source acceleration. It’s a system wide acceleration. Seems to flee gravity.And if they are loosing energy, chances are they are decelerating, casting off energy. They might have had much higher velocities.It wasn’t mentioned how or where the samples were taken. Maybe I missed it.But the earth’s fields, capture a portion of the wind deflected. And I’ll bet some of those captures have high accelerations, angular accelerations. With new ratios of mass/velocity. New states.A physicality supposition. No studies or math to back it up. A picky glean of concepts.ReplyClassical MotionIt has recently been demonstrated while igniting deuterium, That if you hit a particle at incidence, at the right EM rate, the charge will sit still and contract. Gaining rest mass. No velocity needed.Particles have quantum steps of inertia and rest mass. From acceleration, not velocity.It’s just my opinion. Not an authority.I augured this dynamic before they found it. But I have no references. My only scaffold is classical reasoning. With a classical model.

information you agree to theterms conditionsandprivacy policyand are aged  or overdetecting these high energy electrons and positrons with energies of several teraelectronvolts higher than any particle accelerators on earth are able to achieve has been particularly challenging for a couple of reasonsfirstly galactic magnetic fields cause electrons to deviate from a straight path arriving on earth from seemingly random directions secondly spacebased instruments are too small to capture enough of these particles partly due to the particles uneven energy distribution in spacein other words cosmic ray sources accelerate particles gradually with higherenergy particles being more likely to escape their systems because reaching the highest energies takestime this leads to an abundance of lowenergy particles and progressively fewer particles at higher energy levels at high energies the cosmic ray flux falls rapidly meaning space instruments collect too few of them de naurois explainedon the other hand however groundbased telescopes that detect cosmic rays indirectly have a difficult time differentiating cosmic ray electrons from countless other types of cosmic rays bombardingearths atmospherehess in contrast has a huge effective area making it particularly suitable to study the high energy part of the electron spectrum de naurois saidthe hess observatory consisting of five large telescopes spread across an area of about the size of a football field was designed to capture atmospheric showers that emit cherenkov radiation this radiation occurs when highenergy particles collide with the earths atmosphere creating particle showers that the telescopes can detect and analyzeartists impression of a pulsar with its powerful magnetic field rotating around it the clouds of charged particles moving along the field lines emit gamma rays that are focused by the magnetic fields rather like the beams of light from a lighthouse in these magnetic fields pairs of positrons and electrons are created and accelerated making pulsars potential sources of highenergy cosmic electrons and positronsimage credit nasagoddard space flight center conceptual image labthough its main purpose is to detectgamma raysand find their sources the team repurposed the data to search for these high energy cosmic ray electrons the algorithm used here is based on a pixelbypixel comparison using sophisticated statistical modeling specifically likelihood analysis between a precalculated model and the images recorded by the camera said de nauroisoriginally the algorithm was adapted to detect electrons which are subtly different from gamma rays they also had to be able to differentiate the electrons from background signals and because electrons are rare in the data the algorithm had to be adjusted to reject other cosmic ray particles by applying stricter criteria but this also resulted in fewer electrons being detectedto improve accuracy every telescope observation was thoroughly simulated providing a deeper understanding of how the instruments behave said de nauroisthis resulted in an unparalleled set of statistical data for analyzing cosmicray electrons the team confirmed that the electron energy spectrum extends up to at least  tev which is  times higher than the energydetection capabilities of earthbased accelerators a sharp break in the spectrum around  tev indicates that electrons at this energy lose energy rapidly within themilky way suggesting as de naurois stated that they originate from relatively nearby sourcesthe sharpness of this break implies that only a few or possibly just one cosmic source is responsible for these electrons he added if multiple sources were involved the spectrum would be smoother with breaks occurring at different energy levels the best candidates are relatively old supernovas or strong stellar winds from wr stars the bare cores of initially massive stars whose original hydrogenrich envelope has

The company published its first prototype design in atechnical paperas well.The company said that this could potentially expand the connectivity bandwidth in a data center, which could in turn significantly decrease the amount of energy consumed by generative AI applications. The company’s calculations suggest the energy saved in training a large language model would be equal to the annual power consumed by 5,000 homes–and it would happen up to five times faster than conventional training.“If we can reduce this communication bottleneck, then GPUs can talk to each other much faster, and that can really save us power,” Mukesh Khare, general manager of IBM semiconductors, said in a media briefing.Stay tuned.Yesterday’s Coal Can Turn Into Tomorrow’s BatteryMaking graphite from coalOak Ridge National LaboratoryThe world is increasingly relianton electronics and batteries for everyday life. And that means turning to a material that you can find in your old school box: graphite. The same material that makes your pencil possible is also a crucial component of lithium-ion batteries and other electronic devices.But supplies of graphite are beginning to show their limits, with shortages expected by the beginning of the next decade. And the world is mostly dependent on China for the material: it produces nearly 80% of the world’s supply, both from mines and manufacturing of artificial graphite.In the meantime, while moving towards renewable energy is an overall positive, it’s had an economic cost in coal-producing regions of the United States as demand has declined. But researchers from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory may have a solution: they’ve developedtwo new processesthat can transform coal in many of its forms into graphite to power the next generation of technology.There are two separate processes for this, project lead Edgar Lara-Curzio explained to me. The first is the heat up coal to about 800 degrees Celsius, at which point the volatile chemicals turn to gasses, leaving char behind, which is ground into small particles and milled. They are then loaded into an electrochemical reactor that heats it up to about 1500 degrees Celsius, resulting in the production of graphite. The process is similar to what happened when car bumpers used to be electroplated, Lara-Curzio added.The second method is applied to coal slurries, where coal is mixed with water or other liquid. These are filtered and treated to create pitch, which is then added to a solvent to dissolve. The resulting mixture is sprayed through a nozzle, which evaporates the solvent leaving spherical particles behind that are then electrochemically treated the same way as the ground char.Both processes, when scaled, are likely to be less expensive than current graphite production methods, Lara-Curzio said. “When you compare the cost per kilogram of our process to the conventional processes, you utilize less energy, that’s probably the biggest factor,” he said. “In terms of capital equipment, they may also be less expensive.”So far in the lab, scientists can produce graphite from coal using a batch process. The next step, Lara-Curzio said, is to work with industry to develop a scalable, continuous process of manufacturing. This is not only important for meeting the growing demand for the material, he said, but also for the coal-producing communities America’s economy was built on.“This country became a superpower because of inexpensive coal,” said Lara-Curzio, who added. “It would be an incredible story if we could bring back some of those jobs related to coal, but to support new industries and new technologies.”DISCOVERY OF THE WEEK: GOOGLE’S NEW QUANTUM CHIPGoogle unveiledWillow, its newquantum computing chip, which boasts the ability to quickly correct errors in computation, a key barrier to scaling quantum computing. Google’schip architecturecreates alattice of qubitsthat, interestingly enough, are better at correcting errors the bigger they get. The companypublished its experimental resultsinNature.FINAL FRONTIER:BLUE ORIGIN TO LAUNCH ITS FIRST SATELLITEEarlier this week, Jeff Bezos' space companyBlue Originannounced that itsfirst Blue Ring satelliteis ready to launch on theNew Glenn, the company’s orbital rocket.

But according toresearchersat the University of Mississippi, particular phrases in a job placement–like looking for candidates who are“results-oriented”or""persuasive""or“think outside the box”–will tend to attract applicants who are more willing to engage in unethical behavior, particularly narcissists.

The investment will cut the company’s planned modernization timeline in half, Commerce said.The Pentagon plans to spend $1.7 trillion on the F-35 program including buying 2,500 planes in the coming decades. The chips are critical to F-15s and F-35s.The Commerce Department is also finalizing $23.9 million for Rocket Lab unit SolAero Technologies Corp, which the government said would boost the company's production of solar cells by 50 per cent over the next three years.Rocket Lab, founded in 2006 by New Zealander Peter Beck, is one of two U.S. firms specializing in the production of highly efficient, radiation resistant compound semiconductors called space-grade solar cells.The company's solar cells support U.S. space programs, including missile awareness systems, the James Webb Space Telescope, NASA's Artemis lunar explorations, Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, and Mars Insight Lander.Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told Reuters this month the department is racing to complete as many agreements as possible under the Biden administration's $52.7 billion ""Chips and Science"" program before President-elect Donald Trump, who criticized the program, takes office on Jan. 20.Commerce earlier this month finalized its first major award - a $6.6 billion subsidy for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's U.S. unit.Last week, Commerce finalized a $1.5 billion subsidy for GlobalFoundries to expand semiconductor production in Malta, New York and Vermont.Source: ReutersSign up for our newslettersGet our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inboxSubscribe hereGet the CNA appStay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best storiesDownload hereGet WhatsApp alertsJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat appJoin hereAdvertisementAlso worth readingContent is loading...AdvertisementExpand to read the full storyGet bite-sized news via a newcards interface.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on RDW. Redwire Corporation (RDW)'s share was trading at $13.96 as of Nov 29th.A huge in-process machining center producing parts for aircraft and aerospace systems.Redwire Corporation stands out as an undervalued gem in the burgeoning space sector, leveraging its foundational success as a critical supplier across diverse aerospace domains. The company’s partnerships with giants like NASA, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Blue Origin, and Rocket Lab underscore its dominant footprint in space infrastructure. Notably, Redwire's ongoing collaboration with Eli Lilly on 3D bioprinting organs in space represents groundbreaking innovation with significant progress reported. The acquisition of Hera Systems has further bolstered its presence in the national security space market, complemented by its advanced RF payload contracts with leading defense contractors.Strategic alliances continue to propel Redwire forward, including its membership in the US-U.A.E. council, which highlights its role as a leader in American space innovation. Redwire’s Memorandum of Understanding with NASA’s REMIS-2 mission and its critical onboard computer contributions to the European Space Agency’s Hera planetary defense mission exemplify its pivotal role in next-generation space initiatives. Furthermore, Redwire’s provision of solar arrays for Thales Alenia and development of the advanced Valkyrie Thruster for surging national security programs reinforce its technological edge. The company also secured a DARPA prime contract to integrate revolutionary air-breathing satellite propulsion for very-low Earth orbit (VLEO) missions and is developing a robotic arm for the European Lunar Exploration Mission.Despite these advancements, Redwire remains strikingly undervalued compared to peers like Rocket Lab and ASTS, trading at a modest P/S ratio of 1.58 with a market cap of just $900M. Analysts suggest that a fair valuation could see Redwire’s stock reaching $42, offering substantial upside. The space sector is gaining momentum as a thematic investment trend, driven by high-profile successes from SpaceX, ASTS, and Rocket Lab’s milestones. With a market cap poised to surpass $1 billion by year-end in a worst-case scenario, Redwire offers a rare combination of advanced capabilities and untapped growth potential. Its CEO’s mantra, “If space wins, Redwire wins,” captures the company’s trajectory as the building blocks of space infrastructure.Story ContinuesRedwire Corporation (RDW) is not on our list of the31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 7 hedge fund portfolios held RDW at the end of the third quarter which was 8 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of RDW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RDW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Nowand30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

""On the other hand, if Musk were to want to cut out other companies in the competition for rockets, that would not be a good thing. And I think Musk is smarter than that.""NASA's Space Launch System rocket is seen atop pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center before its maiden flight in 2022. Its second flight, carrying a crew of four, is scheduled for launch in April 2026.NASASpaceX already delivers cargo to the International Space Station with its unpiloted Dragon capsules and ferries astronauts to and from the outpost aboard its Crew Dragon spacecraft.Critical to the Artemis moon program, SpaceX also is building a variant of its Starship rocket tocarry astronauts back to the lunar surface in 2027. It will be NASA's first such landing since the final Apollo mission in 1972.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' company, Blue Origin, also is building a moon lander for NASA, giving the agency alternatives in case one company's spacecraft is grounded for some reason.But in the near term, SpaceX is ""the horse that we're going to ride, and we're expecting that horse to be able to run and run fast,"" Nelson said. ""And if not, we've got another horse and it's called Blue Origin.""An artist's impression of a SpaceX lunar lander on the surface of the moon. The lander is a modified version of the Starship upper stage used with SpaceX's Super Heavy booster.NASAAt Nelson insistence shortly after taking office, NASA held a second competition for a second lunar lander ""based on the principle that you want to have two spacecraft in case something happens to one of them,"" Nelson said.""If ever there's been a demonstration of the wisdom of having two competitors, it was for the cargo and crew to the space station.""NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing to build commercial crew ferry ships in the wake of the space shuttle's retirement in 2011.While SpaceX has successfully launched 10 sets of astronauts and cosmonauts to the station aboard Crew Dragon capsules, along with five purely commercial flights to orbit,Boeing's Starliner spacecrafthas carried just two crew members to the lab.CommanderBarry ""Butch"" Wilmore and Sunita Williamstook off on Boeing's first piloted Starlinertest flight June 5. The mission was expected to last eight to 10 days, but thruster problems and propellant leaks combined to extend the crew's stay aboard the ISS while engineers carried out extensive testing.In the end, NASA decided tobring the Starliner downwithout its crew, switching Wilmore and Williams to a Crew Dragon and delaying their return to Earth until mid February. On Tuesday, NASA announced launch of the next Crew Dragon, carrying a replacement ISS crew, is slipping toat least the end of March.That meansWilmore and Williams will log an additional month and a half in orbitbefore finally coming home after 10 months in space. Asked if he had any words of encouragement for the Starliner astronauts, Nelson said simply ""they are true professionals, as are all of our astronauts, and they meet whatever is the need of NASA.""Future of NASA's Artemis moon programThe Isaacman nomination has prompted speculation in some quarters that NASA's Artemis moon program, relying on the agency's costly Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, could face major changes, including a possible switch from the SLS to SpaceX's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.Nelson said a different rocket might be used in the 2030s, but the SLS is the only choice available for moon flights through the end of the current decade.""Understand, that there is currently one human-rated rocket that has been to the moon and back, and that is SLS,"" Nelson said.NASA launchedthe first SLS on the program's maiden flight in 2021, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule on a looping flight around the moon and back. The second SLS is being prepared for launch in the April 2026 timeframe to send four astronauts on a similar out-and-back-again trip around the moon.Left to right: Artemis 2 Canadian backup astronaut Jenni Gibbons, NASA  backup Andre Douglas, and prime crew members Jeremy Hansen of Canada, NASA's  Christina Koch, NASA pilot Victoria Glover and NASA commander Reid  Wiseman.William Harwood/CBS NewsAfter that, the Artemis 3 mission is tentatively targeted for launch in 2027. In that flight, an SLS will boost astronauts to the moon in an Orion capsule that will dock with SpaceX's lander in lunar orbit. From there, two astronauts will descend to touchdown near the moon's south pole where ice deposits may await discovery.""Right now, when you add up all of that, you're talking about a number of years down the road, you're talking about Artemis 3 landing in mid '27 and then the others to follow,"" Nelson said. ""This is fiscal year '25, we're talking at least into fiscal year 3031.""So by that time, is there going to be another rocket that's going to supersede (SLS)? I do not know the answer to that. But I know that the SLS and the Artemis program are certainly going to be there for the near future.""Space & AstronomyMoreDiscovery of ""tipped over"" black hole surprises NASA scientistsWhy are the Boeing Starliner astronauts stuck in space?NASA leader weighs in on Elon Musk, SpaceX and plans for moon rocketBoeing Starliner crew's return to Earth delayed yet againHere's when, where the Geminid meteor shower will be visible during peakMoreIn:Elon MuskBill NelsonArtemis ProgramSpaceNASASpaceXWilliam HarwoodBill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News.Twitter© 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

Cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner were on duty monitoring the arrival of Progress. Two of the NASA crew members are Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, theastronauts “stranded”by issues with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft that carried them into orbit in June.

[+]space exploration, 2024 witnessed some of the most transformative technological developments in history.Adobe StockAs we reach the end of another year, it’s time to take a look at some of the biggest events, breakthroughs, and stories that shook the world of technology in 2024.It was a year in which we saw technology play a central role in untold numbers of world-changing events. So here are the biggest game-changers, the most hyped buzzwords and the most important milestones we raced past this year. Who knows what 2025 will bring? But if it’s as fast-moving and unpredictable as this year was, we’d better hold onto our hats.Artificial Intelligence Impacts Elections2024 marked a significant year for democratic processes worldwide, with major elections, including India's record-breaking democratic exercise and the closely watched U.S. presidential election. Emerging technologies, particularly AI, played an unprecedented role in shaping these electoral landscapes. Campaign teams leveraged AI for voter analysis and engagement, developing sophisticated outreach strategies and real-time response systems. However, this technological integration also brought new challenges, as election officials and tech companies worked to address concerns about deepfakes and automated misinformation. The year demonstrated how AI tools could both enhance democratic participation through improved voter engagement and simultaneously create new challenges for maintaining electoral integrity.Future War: Technology On The Battlefields Of UkraineThe ongoing war in Ukraine has established itself as the mosthigh-tech conflictin human history, defined by drone warfare, robotic dog soldiers and cyber-warfare. Beyond this, we’ve seen NGOs deploying facial recognition technology to identify perpetrators of war crimes and new forms of hypersonic missiles never before used in conflict.Amazing Discoveries And Breakthroughs In Sustainability TechPerhaps the most pressing challenge facing technologists in 2024 has involved developing real-world solutions for the climate emergency. One field that has seen significant advances has been the development of carbon capture technologies, such as the microbial solutiondemonstrated by researchersthis year. Together with new developments in battery storage, renewable energy andelectrocaloric cooling, which could pave the way to more energy-efficient refrigeration, important progress continues to be made.MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024ByKevin PayneContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024ByCassidy HortonContributorTechnology Beyond The Final FrontierAs scientists and engineers continue working towards human colonization of Mars, perhaps 2024’s most impressive space-tech achievement was the successful “catch” of the Space X Super Heavy booster Starship rocket. Following re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere, the arms of the 146-meter (480 ft) “Mechazilla"" tower were used to stabilize and land the rocket. In other space news, in 2024 India joined the U.S., Russia and China to become the fourth country to land on the moon.Quantum Computing Records SmashedWhile work progressed on applying quantum computing to everyday tasks and applications, back in the lab, records wereonce again smashedwhen unparalleled levels of performance were achieved. The 56-qubit H2-1 computer built by Quantinuum overtook the previous record set by Google’s Sycamore platform by a factor of more than 100. While quantum computing won’t be useful for every type of application, it has the potential to revolutionize fields such as solving optimization and cryptography, where it could enable complex computational tasks to be carried out hundreds of millions of times more quickly.First T-Cell Therapy To Treat Solid Tumors Receives FDA ApprovalNotable breakthroughs in biotechnology in 2024 included the firstFDA approvalfor a personalized immunotherapy treatment targeting T-cells, designed to help the body’s immune system target solid tumor cells. This engineered cell therapy was granted accelerated approval following early-stage trials in which Tecelra, developed genetically modifying a patient’s own white blood cells, was found to be effective at shrinking tumors in 44% of patients.As we reflect on 2024's technological milestones, it's clear that we're living through a period of unprecedented innovation and change. While these developments bring immense promise – from revolutionary cancer treatments to sustainable energy solutions – they also present new challenges that society must carefully navigate. As we look ahead to 2025, the pace of technological advancement shows no signs of slowing, suggesting that we're only at the beginning of what promises to be a transformative decade in human history.Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Check outmywebsiteor some of my other workhere.Bernard MarrFollowingEditorial StandardsForbes AccoladesJoin The ConversationCommentsOne Community.

NASA has contracted with SpaceX to provide the lunar landing system. Credit: SpaceXPosted onDecember 6, 2024December 6, 2024byCarolyn Collins PetersenNASA Pushes Human Moon Landing Back to 2027The Artemis moon landings are delayed again due to technical difficulties. This time, the problem is with the Orion spacecraft heat shield. NASA administrator Bill Nelson announced that the new landing dates are in April of 2026 for Artemis II and sometime in 2027 for the first human landing during the Artemis III mission.The difficulties the Artemis program faces stem from the complexity of the hardware and trajectories needed to take astronauts to the Moon according to Nelson. “The Artemis campaign is the most daring, technically challenging, collaborative, international endeavor humanity has ever set out to do,” said Nelson. He pointed out that the mission has made a lot of progress. However, there’s more work to be done, in particular on the Orion life support systems. Artemis II is next up in early 2026. It will be a test flight to demonstrate the viability of all the systems, said Nelson. “We need to get this next test flight right. That’s how the Artemis campaign succeeds.”Making a safe return through Earth’s atmosphere is a vital part of the mission. After Orion came back from itsArtemis 1 missionin November 2022, engineers noticed issues with the heat shield. They figured out that gases generated inside the heat shield didn’t vent properly. That caused cracks in the shield and triggered an investigation. The decision to delay the Artemis II test flight came after that investigation. This allows NASA engineers to work with the heat shield currently attached to the Orion capsule for the April 2026 flight. In addition, they’re studying the re-entry process to avoid future problems with the shield.Artemis II to the MoonAs we all know, the Artemis program will allow long-term exploration of the Moon. The April 2026 mission is a test flight that will orbit, but not land, and then return to Earth. The idea is to test all the spacecraft’s systems with astronauts on board.The Orion spacecraft is the crew’s living quarters and lab, all in one. It’s built to carry four astronauts from Earth to space and ultimately to the Moon. It makes sense that this “home away from home” has to be shielded from pretty much anything that space—and Earth’s atmosphere—can throw at the capsule. This includes the ultrahot trip through our atmosphere on the return trip. At times, Orion experiences temperatures up to 2700 C (5000 F), which could harm the capsule if not for the shielding. So, the shield is a life-saver.The heat shield retrieved after the Artemis 1 test flight to the Moon. Crews inspected it to understand what caused it to char. Courtesy: NASA.When Orion first encountered the heat shield problem, engineers determined that heating rates increased during the spaceship’s planned “dips” into the atmosphere. It was performing a skip guidance entry technique. Heat built up inside the heat shield’s material and gases accumulated. Eventually, that cracked areas in the outer layer of the shield and blew some of it off to space. It turns out that if astronauts had been aboard, they would not have been affected. However, now that engineers understand what occurred, they can enhance the heat shield material to make sure it doesn’t happen again. In addition, the mission plan will be altered to change how far the capsule flies between atmospheric re-entry and eventual landing.Upgrading Mission PlansThe extended time until the April 2026 and mid-2027 Artemis missions will allow improvements to the capsule and launch systems. For example, engineers can give more attention to environmental and life support systems. This is particularly important for the Artemis III mission. It will launch on top of a Space Launch System rocket into Earth orbit. Once there, the mission will perform a translunar injection to send it to lunar space.Not only will it carry astronauts to the Moon, but they will land in the south polar region using a SpaceX landing system. That 30-day mission will require at least two crew members to spend a week at the pole collecting samples, doing site photography, and measuring conditions there.This image shows nine candidate landing regions for NASA’s Artemis III mission, with each region containing multiple potential sites for the first crewed landing on the Moon in more than 50 years. The background image of the lunar South Pole terrain within the nine regions is a mosaic of LRO (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter) WAC (Wide Angle Camera) images.
Credit: NASAArtemis III will be the first time anyone has set foot on the Moon since the last Apollo mission in December 1972. The entire Artemis program aims at providing long-term habitation and study of Earth’s nearest neighbor in space. To that end,NASA has been studying several interesting landing spotsat the pole.Eventually, there will be an orbiting lunar station, plus habitats on the surface and regular trips between. NASA and other agencies expect that lunar explorers will be spending their time studying the surface and geology of the Moon, plus determining what resources are available for long-term exploration and habitation. However, given the pace of the program, those next developments probably won’t take place until the 2030s.For More InformationNASA Identifies Cause of Artemis I Orion Heat Shield Chart LossAs Artemis

[+]on-board AI systemRendering courtesy of Will Marshall and Planet Labs“It’s an extraordinary achievement, and Vance nicely illustrates how those images ‘have already seeped into our lives (as the source, for instance, of many satellite photos we see of the Ukraine war).’”The book, and the film, also trace Marshall’s earlier stint at the NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley, and the strange chain of events that led to his being catapulted into that post.Will Marshall and Robbie Schingler met while writing a torrent of academic papers that warnedagainst deploying weaponsin low Earth orbit, and then co-authored space-peace manifestos while presenting them at conferences around the world.At one gathering, where an American general was giving a talk on a proposal to station armed interceptors in low Earth orbit to shoot down enemy-launched missiles, Marshall and Schingler picketed outside the venue to protest the envisioned weaponization of space.“Peace in space - no space weapons”“We stood outside and handed out these little flyers: Peace in space, no space weapons,” recalled Marshall.By an incredible twist of fate, that evening they bumped into the speaker, General Pete Worden, the one-time tech lead for the Strategic Defense Initiative - a proposed space-based missile defense shield. The general and the peace activists staged an impromptu but friendly debate on the missile defense plans - all inside the unlikely venue of a Houston nightclub.That chance meeting would ultimately change all their lives.When Washington despatchedWorden, an acclaimed astrophysicist, to head up NASA Ames, he invited the future founders of Planet, along with a constellation of other young space scientists with a rebellious streak, to join what would become a futuristic skunkworks of radical spaceflight experiments - rejecting NASA’s rigid traditionalism in favor of Silicon Valley’s mantra of “Move fast and break things.”During Will Marshall's stint there, NASA Ames Research Center was transformed into a futuristic... [+]skunkworks of radical spaceflight experiments   (NASA). (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)Getty Images“When I came to Ames,” Worden recalled, “I brought a hat-trick of young people with me.”“These are like the best of the best PhDs in all different areas of physics, computer science,” recounts a narrator. “It really started a revolution - or I might call it a counterrevolution.”Nearby, Elon Musk and SpaceX, tapping the energy and zeitgeist of Silicon Valley, were racing to loft their first rocket, even as the new space iconoclasts were transforming NASA Ames, and the two sides clicked.Around the same time, Apple’s launch of the avant-garde iPhone, which combined a leading-edge camera, transmitter and Web interface - the same components required for a simple Earth-observation satellite - triggered an epiphany for Marshall.Metamorphosis of a smartphone into a satelliteHe raced through experiments aimed at transforming an advanced smartphone into the world’s first micro-scale imaging sat.Commander Worden, while shielding his Ames acolytes from volleys of criticism being fired off from NASA headquarters in Washington, even gushed to Barack Obama, during a presidential tour of the freewheeling research outpost, that his group had sent the cheapest-ever spacecraft into orbit on a mission to image the planet.While Marshall’s first prototype CubeSat cameras were shot into space by NASA, they would ultimately give rise to the more sophisticated satellites designed and launched by the newborn Planet Labs.His inner, utopian compass might have been partly shaped by his pole-star professor at Oxford University - theoretical physicist Roger Penrose - who would later be awarded theNobel Prize in Physicsfor his world-leading discoveries surrounding black holes and other cosmic phenomena predicted by Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, including competing models describing the unfolding of the universe following the Big Bang.Marshall’s ongoing drive to end the military conflict in Ukraine, and to halt the testing worldwide of anti-satellite missiles, in some ways resemblesEinstein’s earlier campaignto abolish nuclear super-bombs and the entire realm of war.Pete Worden says of Planet Labs’ founders: “You know, their key objective was a utopian one. In fact they called their satellites Doves and that they were sort of peace sats.”SpaceX helped ignite a revolution of independent space players that would spread out across the... [+]globe, just as Planet Labs opened a new era by circling the Earth with cutting-edge imaging satellites  (Photo by Tim Peake / ESA/NASA via Getty Images)gettyYet Planet Labs’ play-by-play revelations of Moscow’s every battle move across Ukraine, along with SpaceX’s airlifting of thousands of Starlink satellite terminals into the besieged democracy, have infuriated the Kremlin.Russian fighter-bombers target SpaceX terminalsOver the last two years, Putin’s lieutenants havetrumpeted their threatsto begin shooting down allied satellites aiding Kyiv, even as Russia’s strategic weapons designers develop a newnuclear-armed spacecraftthat could stalk Western players across low Earth orbit.As it pushes forward the first phase of its Space War against Ukraine, the Kremlin has deployed fighter-bombers, missile brigades and drones to attack Starlink terminals along the borderlands, and last week launched its newOreshnik nuclear-capable missileto attack the Rocket City of Dnipro.Yet Will Marshall remains convinced that shining a luminous spotlight from space on war maneuvers planet-wide could ultimately stamp out combat as a means of interaction between fellow members of the UN.He says that to speed up that outcome, Planet has been closely collaborating with Human Rights Watch and other leading rights defenders, along with investigative journalists, to map Russia’s violations of international law that could one day help convict Putin and his two top generals of war crimes at the International Criminal Court.Putin’s war crimes trialThe Court, based in the Netherlands, has already issued anarrest warrant for Putin, and for thetwo Russian generals who have spearheaded the invasionof Ukraine.Professor Jack Beard, a former Pentagon counsel who is one of the world’s leading experts on the mosaic of international treaties governing war crimes, told me in an interview that Planet’s powerful imagery will make for super-strong evidence at the Putin trial.He adds that if Russia’s democratic faction - whose survivors are imprisoned across the country’s gulag archipelago or have escaped to freedom in exile - miraculously managed to gain power, the Kremlin’s new rulers could turn Putin over to the ICC’s international panel of judges.During a“No Putin. No War” protestthat crisscrossed the center of Berlin earlier this month,Russia’s dissidents-in-exile- headed by Yulia Navalnaya, the wife of the slain opposition leader Alexei Navalny - called for Putin to be extradited to The Hague to face the war crimes charges that now hang over his head like a planet-spanning Sword of Damocles.Leaders of Russia's democratic opposition, headed by Yulia Navalnaya, stage an anti-war protest in...

It said there was no indication of injury or damage to the outside facility.""JAXA will conduct a thorough investigation into the cause of the problem and consider countermeasures,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said at a regular press briefing.Hayashi, the top government spokesperson, said rocket development is ""extremely important"" to ensure the autonomy of Japan's space program.JAXA partnered with the aerospace unit of heavy machinery maker IHI to develop Epsilon S, the next generation in the Epsilon solid-fuel small rocket series.Shares in IHI were down as much as 6% in Tokyo trade. An IHI Aerospace spokesperson said the company is investigating the cause.Epsilon S's debut flight was slated by the end of the fiscal year through March 31 depending on the success of Tuesday's engine test.The test was conducted after previous failures triggered months of investigation that have delayed space missions and satellite launch plans.In July last year, an Epsilon S engine test failed due to thermal damage to its ignition systems. That followed a launch failure in 2022.JAXA's larger flagship rocket H3, built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, failed at its first launch last year but has succeeded in three flights this year, launching Japanese satellites and winning orders including from French satellite operator Eutelsat.The H3 and Epsilon S are central to JAXA's ambition to build cost-competitive rockets amid the rise of American commercial launch providers such as market leader SpaceX and small rocket maker Rocket Lab.In the private sector, IHI-backed Space One is set to attempt the second launch of its Kairos small rocket on Dec 14 after the first flight exploded in March.

That's a question that used to be a fairly simple one--Fortnite became popular as a battle royale, so ""games like Fortnite"" usually meant other battle royale games. The situation is a little bit different now that we're in Fortnite's seventh year of existence, as Epic Games' metaverse has grown in a lot of different ways. On top of that battle royale mode, there's Fortnite Festival, Lego Fortnite, Rocket Racing, and thousands of user-created islands in the bottomless pit that is Fortnite Creative.Fortnite is still primarily known as a battle royale, judging by the player-counts--but the rest of Fortnite continues to grow. Some folks, like me, like to sample everything, and some tend to stay in the modes and games they already know they enjoy and don't feel much of an urge to explore. There's nothing at all wrong with either approach--it just means that ""games like Fortnite"" can mean pretty different things to different people these days.With that in mind, we're going to make our recommendations based on some of the various niches that can be found within Fortnite, rather than looking for other games that have this same breadth and scope. There just aren't many games that can compare, so it would be silly to go that route. Instead, scroll on for recommendations for other games that hit some of the same niches that Fortnite does. Many of these are free-to-play; for more of those, check out our picks for thebest free games.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesThe Best RPGs Of 2024 According To MetacriticThe Best PlayStation Games Of 2024 According To MetacriticThe Best Shooter Games Of 2024 According To MetacriticCall of Duty / Call of Duty: WarzoneFor fans of: Shooty shootyDeveloper: Raven Software, Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer GamesRelease Date: March 10, 2020Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|SGenre: Shooter, battle royaleOne key reason that Fortnite has persisted is that Epic is able and willing to spend so much money and resources keeping it up. Very few companies would ever even be able toconsiderthe sort of spending Epic does on Fortnite, but Activision is definitely one of them, turning out Call of Duty games with blockbuster-movie budgets year after year. With that being the case, Call of Duty, including Warzone, makes for an excellent alternative to Fortnite--it's got battle royale in averydifferent flavor, it's got other modes to mess around with when you're tired of the open world, it's got tons of great cosmetics and skins, and rarely does Activision cheap out. It's notasfree as Fortnite, since playing standard multiplayer requires buying a new game every year, but it's solid counterprogramming even so.See at AmazonPUBG: Battlegrounds / PUBG MobileFor fans of: Battle royale gamesDeveloper: PUBG StudiosRelease Date: December 20, 2017Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Android, iOSGenre: Shooter, battle royalePlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is the game that popularized the battle royale genre, from which Fortnite took cues from in developing its own BR mode. This OG battle royale is still going strong today, even though the days when it dominated all of PC gaming are long gone--and while it lacks the polish of Fortnite, there's still something very endearing about going back to the original and seeing how it's evolved.See PUBG on SteamApex LegendsFor fans of: Action and shooter games with fast movement, battle royale gamesDeveloper: Respawn EntertainmentRelease Date: February 4, 2019Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, Android, iOSGenre: Shooter, battle royaleEA's entry in the battle royale genre carved out its own niche by pairing Titanfall's sick movement mechanics--something Fortnite cribbed from with its own movement updates during Chapter 3--with a hero shooter. Thanks to that unique combination, Apex Legends has a fundamentally different feel from Fortnite, and that makes it a great option for when you need a break from Epic's never-ending grind.See Apex Legends on SteamHunt: ShowdownFor fans of: Historical action games, extraction shooters, battle royale gamesDeveloper: CrytekRelease Date: February 22, 2018Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|SGenre: Extraction shooter, battle royaleCrytek's cooperative shooter--it has both an extraction-shooter/bounty-hunter PvPvE mode as well as a battle royale--has a distinctly different flavor from all the competition because it's set in the late 1800s and features period-appropriate gadgets and weapons in a Van Helsing-esque gothic setting. So even while it covers some of the same ground as other games you may have played, the package it comes in is novel enough that it doesn't matter.See Hunt: Showdown at HumbleDead by DaylightFor fans of: Competitive multiplayer, horror moviesDeveloper: Behaviour InteractiveRelease Date: June 14, 2016Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, Android, iOSGenre: Cooperative, asymmetrical multiplayerThis is a scrappy asymmetrical indie multiplayer game in which four survivors have to match wits with a single, player-controlled boss enemy. Thereisa Fortnite comparison to be made just with that cooperative gameplay alone, which is a blast, but where it really hits the spot and can even surpass Fortnite is in its DLC--while Fortnite has some pretty solid horror movie skins, Dead by Daylight haswaymore.Fanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.See Dead by Daylight at FanaticalTrackmaniaFor fans of: Arcade-style racing games, making custom tracksDeveloper: Ubisoft NadeoRelease Date: July 1, 2020Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|SGenre: RacingWith arcade-style driving mechanics, tracks that do loops and make you do big jumps, and the ability to design and share your own wacky tracks, Trackmania sounds a whole lot like Rocket Racing. But while Rocket Racing is still in its infancy, folks have been plugging away at Ubisoft's free-to-play racer for years now, and it's chock full of weird and interesting tracks that anybody can try.See Trackmania on SteamDescendersFor fans of: Racing games, extreme sports gamesDeveloper: RageSquidRelease Date: May 7, 2019Platforms: PC, Mac, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, Android, iOSGenre: Driving, platformingIf you were to combine the more forgiving arcade-style controls of Rocket Racing with the platforming of Trials, you'd end up with something like Descenders: a game about riding a dirtbike down hills. The beauty of this one is that it's only ever as easy or difficult as you want it--you can have a relaxing ride down a slight slope, or go with a path on an ultra-steep incline that's covered in huge jumps. And since there's no battle pass to grind here, you can simply enjoy Descenders because it's fun, and not because you're being coerced into it with the promise of free cosmetics.See Descenders on FanaticalRock Band 4For fans of: Rhythm gamesDeveloper: HarmonixRelease Date: October 6, 2015Platforms: PS4, Xbox OneGenre: RhythmIf you enjoy Fortnite Festival but are frustrated by how weirdly expensive the songs are, Rock Band 4 goes for just $10 on digital storefronts these days, and you get more than 100 songs for that small sum. There's a catch, of course--Rock Band 4 was not designed primarily to be played with a gamepad the way Festival is, and so ideally you'll need a plastic instrument to go with it. So for those folks who bought the new PDP Riffmaster guitar for Festival, you can get a little more bang for your buck with Rock Band 4, because that guitar is fully compatible with it.See Rock Band 4 on the PS StoreHatsune Miku: Project DIVAFor fans of: Rhythm gamesDeveloper: SegaRelease date: 2016 for most recent console version, 2022 for most recent PC versionPlatforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, ArcadesGenre: RhythmSome hardcore Festival players have noted that Festival is pretty forgiving for a rhythm game, particularly when playing on a gamepad. If you're one of those people looking for an additional challenge but don't want to deal with plastic guitars, give one of the Hatsune Miku games a chance--any max-difficulty song in a recent Project Diva game ismuchharder than anything you'll find in Festival, and you still get to play dress-up with your characters. And the most recent games include literally hundreds of songs, so it'll take a very long time to get bored.See Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix+ on FanaticalBeat SaberFor fans of: VR, rhythm gamesDeveloper: Beat GamesRelease Date: May 21, 2019Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Meta QuestGenre: VR, rhythmVery few virtual reality games are worth the hassle of dealing with a VR setup for most folks, but the rhythm game Beat Saber is certainly an example of one thatis. This is both because it's a lot of fun and because players have uploaded tons of custom charts for a shocking amount of music, so you won't have to spend hundreds of dollars' worth of fake currency to get it.See Beat Saber on HumbleTower UniteFor fans of: Hanging out in digital spacesDeveloper: PixelTail GamesRelease Date: April 8, 2016Platforms: PC, LinuxGenre: Social, party, minigamesThis janky little metaverse, which contains no microtransactions at all, is one of my favorite little virtual spaces to visit because it doesn't really have any hook--it's just a place to hang out, where you can play mini-golf on some surprisingly cool courses, or play blackjack at a casino, and there are a ton of really strange little user-created sub-worlds. But what really makes Tower Unite work is the Steam Workshop, where you can find tons of user-created skins of pretty much anything--my main is Shrek smoking a cigarette.See Tower Unite at HumbleSecond LifeFor fans of: Hanging out in digital spaces, and having a job to do while you're thereDeveloper: Linden LabRelease Date: June 23, 2003Platforms: PC, Mac, Linux, Android, iOSGenre: Social, life simThe original metaverse--in this case essentially a virtual version of our world, in which the purpose of playing is simply to exist in that space and participate in this digital society--is somehow still around after more than two decades. It's a credit not just to the concept, but how solid the foundation is that Linden Lab built for it.Check out Second Life freeWarframeFor fans of: Racing games, extreme sports gamesDeveloper: Digital ExtremesRelease Date: March 25, 2013Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, iOSGenre: Action, live-serviceThe online actioner Warframe has long been a stalwart of the live-service genre, persisting for more than a decade while most other attempts at that kind of thing have crashed and burned. A big part of that is Warframe's incentive structure--there'salwayssomething to grind for in Warframe, because most cosmetics and unlocks can be earned through play, and its battle pass is free.See Warframe at FanaticalDestiny 2For fans of: ShootersDeveloper: BungieRelease Date: September 6, 2017Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|SGenre: Shooter, live-serviceWhen the original Destiny originally launched back in 2014, it was successful in large part because it was the new shooter game and universe from the people who made Halo. But it and its 2017 sequel maintained that success by combining Bungie's unrivaled shooter feel with one of the best live-service hamster wheels in gaming. Destiny 2 is simply so enjoyable on its most basic level that it takes real effort to get burnt out on it.See Destiny 2: The Final Shape at FanaticalFall GuysFor fans of: Platforming, silly game showsDeveloper: MediatonicRelease Date: August 4, 2020Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, Android, iOSGenre: Driving, platformingThis goofy, bean-based game show, in which you compete against dozens of other players in a series of Nickelodeon-style competitions, is perpetually amusing, and since it's owned by Epic Games, it's packed with all sorts of cosmetic options that you can buy from the shop or unlock from the battle pass. But Fall Guys is great primarily because it's a totally unique experience that will constantly put a smile on your face, even if you don't mess with the cosmetics at all.See Fall Guys at the Epic Games StoreMinecraftFor fans of: Survival, craftingDeveloper: MojangRelease Date: May 17, 2009Platforms: PC, Mac, Linux, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, PS4, PS5, SwitchGenre: Survival, craftingLego Fortnite has been a particularly intriguing addition to Epic's metaverse, but even a year after its release, and tons of updates, it feels a little bit barebones compared with the very-well-established Minecraft. Mojang's game covers a lot of the same ground with its systems of exploration, crafting and building, and since it's been around for so much longer than Fortnite overall, much less Lego Fortnite specifically, there's just so much more going on in Minecraft.See Minecraft at FanaticalAmong UsFor fans of: Casual multiplayer games, party gamesDeveloper: InnerslothRelease Date: Jun 15, 2018Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, Android, iOSGenre: PartyEpic infamously replicated this game, in which players have to complete a series of chores around a base while one or more of them is secretly trying to undermine and murder the others, within Fortnite with the Impostors mode a couple years back.

Skip ahead if you want to dive straight into the new ram-rotor detonation engine!First came the failed flappy wings of da Vinci'sornithopters, inspired directly by birds. Soon after came propellers, which got the Wright Brothers off the ground using constant thrust from spinning blades that could be connected to an engine. Propellers remained the state of the art right up until WW2.In 1939, the first jet-powered aircraft, the Heinkel He 178, took to the skies, switching things up by using its own expelled exhaust gases to create thrust. In 1941, the first turbojet flew in the Gloster E.28/39, adding a turbine-driven compressor to force more air into the combustion chamber for additional power and efficiency.In 1949 we saw the first aircraft, the Leduc 0.10, to fly entirely powered by a ramjet, which also directed compressed air into the engine – but this time compressed entirely by the aircraft's own high-speed forward motion, and an intake shape designed to slow that air way down. The infamousLockheedD-21 drone of the mid-1960s was essentially a ramjet with wings and thus, incapable of taking off under its own power. It had to be launched from the back of a Lockheed M-21 (not to be confused with theSR-71) once it was traveling at supersonic speeds, allowing the ramjet to function properly.The Lockheed D-21, a ramjet with wingsUSAFThe 1950s was a highly innovative time for aerospace, and plenty of what we still use in go-fast flight today was born in this era. We saw the first production turbofan engine by Rolls-Royce, called the Conway, in 1954. Turbofans divert some airflow around the core of a turbojet engine, speeding it up with a large fan, and then mix this bypass air with the jet exhaust.You can adjust the ratio of these two flows; a high bypass ratio is great when you want an engine that's quiet and efficient, a low ratio works when you're prioritizing speed and agility. Nearly every commercial passenger airliner today uses high-bypass turbofan engines.In 1958, the scramjet, or supersonic combustion ramjet, was conceptualized – which would ignite fuel in a combustion chamber while air flowed through continuously at supersonic speeds, eliminating the ramjet's draggy need to slow that airflow down below the speed of sound. But this design wasn't successfully put to the test until 2001 in NASA's X-43A – whereupon it hit an impressive hypersonic speed of Mach 6.8 (5,217 mph or 8,396 km/h) – then three years later,Mach 9.6(7,366 mph or 11,854 km/h).Rotating detonation enginesIn 2020, we saw thefirst of an ""impossible"" new breed of rotating detonation engines (RDEs) fire upon a test bench. These machines leave the slow, controllable world of combustion behind, and instead literally attempt to harness the intense, chaotic energy released in actual explosions.Rotating Detonation Rocket Engine Test at Marshall Space Flight CenterThis is not the nice, predictable oxidation of an air-fuel mix by flame, it's literally hitting explosive fuel molecules hard enough with a shockwave to break apart their chemical bonds, causing them to detonate and release another shockwave. The genius of the RDE is in sending the energy of that shockwave around a ring-shaped channel, and timing the release of more explosive fuel to create a self-sustaining pattern of explosions.The benefit: a theoretical efficiency boost up to 25% over regular combustion engines. One drawback: they work much less efficiently at atmospheric pressures, so they're much happier at supersonic or hypersonic speeds where intake air can easily be compressed to keep conditions ideal for detonation.2024: Enter the ram-rotor detonation engine (RRDE) conceptDr. Haocheng Wen and Prof. Bing Wang of Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, have conceptualized a revolutionary new type of engine they say could improve the efficiency of rotating detonation engines across a wide range of airspeeds.Essentially, it's a rotating detonation engine in which the detonation wave is stabilized within a high-speed rotor. A precisely shaped flow channel within the rotor compresses the air-fuel mixture to the ideal conditions for detonation, whatever the intake speed, and the detonation wave is held in place by balancing the relative velocities of intake airflow and the expanding gases and shockwave leaving the exhaust.As the rotor spins, air is compressed, detonated, and expands before used as thrust in a continuous detonation waveChinese Journal of AeronauticsSo the ram-rotor controls reactant compression, the detonation point, and burned gas expansion within that single rotor. And it uses a continuous supersonic rotating detonation wave as its primary means of propulsion, which is inherently more efficient than traditional deflagration methods. The RRDE achieves higher thermodynamic efficiency by capitalizing on the extreme pressures and temperatures of detonation in a way no traditional ramjet engine can.So far, the RRDE exists only as a design, and has proven itself only in theoretical and simulated lab tests. Theoretical tests say that this beast of an engine should be capable ofhypersonicflight over Mach 5+ (3,836 mph / 6,174 km/h), at considerably higher efficiency than other detonation engines – and the air-compressing ram-rotor should also be able to generate the right conditions for detonation at speeds substantially slower than regular RDEs.This doesn't mean a ram-rotor detonation engine-powered aircraft will necessarily be able to take off under its own power, but it does herald a significant step in detonation engine technology.Of course, challenges remain. Driving that ram rotor requires energy, and that's going to impact efficiency. Sustaining a detonation wave is hard enough in a static ring channel, so keeping one stable in a high-speed rotor won't be a walk in the park. And of course, the rotor blades will need to be light enough to spin quickly and efficiently, but strong enough to handle hypersonic intake airflows ... As well as constant explosive detonations between the blades. Yikes.We hope it's a lot quicker to go from the drawing board to a test aircraft than some previous advances, but the recent acceleration in hypersonic research, particularly out of China, would suggest it'll have a chance to prove itself before long.Source:Chinese Journal of AeronauticsView gallery - 4 imagesTagsAircraftSupersonicHypersonicRotating Detonation EnginesFlightFacebookTwitterFlipboardLinkedIn4 commentsJoe SalasA well-established motorcycle action photographer with high-octane gasoline in his veins, Joe also takes a keen interest in a broad range of technologies, gadgets, outdoor living and adventure topics.Most ViewedBody & MindTurmeric and green tea among six supplements putting people in hospitalSpaceRadio signal from space repeats every hour, defying explanationTransportMonster 310-mile automated cargo conveyor will replace 25,000 trucksLoad More4 commentsSign into post a comment.Please keep comments to less than 150 words. No abusive material or spam will be published.TechGazerDecember 5, 2024 09:45 AMIt seems that stability would be a problem.  It might work nicely in a mathematical simulation, but aircraft hit turbulence and other pressure inconsistencies that would change conditions at the blades far faster than the engine can change blade speed, fuel flow, etc.TheDaleksDecember 5, 2024 02:10 PMMy first concern is the extraordinary RPMs that the rotor would have to spin at in order to keep pace with a detonation wave. Detonation waves by definition have to propagate at above the local speed of sound, however they often travel much faster than this. In a gas explosion (air and some flammable gas), the velocity of detonation often lies between 1700-3000 m/s (Mach 5-9). If I am imagining this engine correctly, that would mean that the edge of the rotor would have to be spinning at 1700-3000 m/s. If one assumes a best-case scenario velocity of 1700 m/s, and an arbitrary radius of 0.3 m, this equates to 900 revolutions per second, or 54000 RPM. The amount of centripetal force this would produce would be enormous. Regular jet engines often operate at around 10000-20000 RPM.dave beDecember 6, 2024 02:09 AMApplications for these arent only for aircraft though. If enabled at atmospheric pressure theres potential for these to be useful anywhere turbines are.As far as extraordinary RPMs this assumes a design like the diagram with essentially a single rotor. There could be other variables lie harmonics or multiblade rotors that change the dynamics after the theoretical work is done.meofbillionsDecember 9, 2024 07:20 AMI don't know about others here but I don't understand how this is supposed to work and I don't see an adequate explanation for it. I'm a Ph.D. in Aerospace so maybe there's something missing here or I've suddenly contracted dementia, which is not something to joke about.I am aware of the rotating detonation rocket engine which doesn't use mechanical parts. It makes use of the tangential acoustic instabilities in a flat combustion chamber. The idea here may be an extension of that, and if it is, it deserves mentioning in the article.GET OUR NEWSLETTEROver 220,000 people receive our email newsletter.

quickly and efficiently but strong enough to handle hypersonic intake airflows as well as constant explosive detonations between the blades yikeswe hope its a lot quicker to go from the drawing board to a test aircraft than some previous advances but the recent acceleration in hypersonic research particularly out of china would suggest itll have a chance to prove itself before longsourcechinese

commentssign into post a commentplease keep comments to less than  words no abusive material or spam will be publishedtechgazerdecember    amit seems that stability would be a problem it might work nicely in a mathematical simulation but aircraft hit turbulence and other pressure inconsistencies that would change conditions at the blades far faster than the engine can change blade speed fuel flow etcthedaleksdecember    pmmy first concern is the extraordinary rpms that the rotor would have to spin at in order to keep pace with a detonation wave detonation waves by definition have to propagate at above the local speed of sound however they often travel much faster than this in a gas explosion air and some flammable gas the velocity of detonation often lies between  ms mach  if i am imagining this engine correctly that would mean that the edge of the rotor would have to be spinning at  ms if one assumes a bestcase scenario velocity of  ms and an arbitrary radius of  m this equates to  revolutions per second or  rpm the amount of centripetal force this would produce would be enormous regular jet engines often operate at around  rpmdave bedecember    amapplications for these arent only for aircraft though if enabled at atmospheric pressure theres potential for these to be useful anywhere turbines areas far as extraordinary rpms this assumes a design like the diagram with essentially a single rotor there could be other variables lie harmonics or multiblade rotors that change the dynamics after the theoretical work is donemeofbillionsdecember    ami dont know about others here but i dont understand how this is supposed to work and i dont see an adequate explanation for it im a phd in aerospace so maybe theres something missing here or ive suddenly contracted dementia which is not something to joke abouti am aware of the rotating detonation rocket engine which doesnt use mechanical parts it makes use of the tangential acoustic instabilities in a flat combustion chamber the idea here may be an extension of that and if it is it deserves mentioning in the articleget our newsletterover  people receive our email newsletter get your daily dose of

The idea of settling the red planet has beenaround for decades. However, it has been seen by sceptics as a delusion at best and mere bluster at worst.Mars might seem superficiallysimilar to Earthin a number of ways. But its atmosphere is thin and humans would need to livewithin pressurised habitatson the surface.Yet in an era where space tourism has become possible, the red planet has emerged as a dreamland for rich eccentrics and techno utopians. As is often the case with science communication, there’s a gulf between how close we are to this ultimate goal and where the general public understands it to be.However, I believe there is a rationale for settling Mars and that this objective is not as far off as some would believe. There are actually a few good reasons to be optimistic about humanity’s future on the red planet.First, Mars is reachable. During an optimal alignment between Earth and Mars as the two planets orbit the Sun, its possible to travel there in a spacecraft insix to eight months. Some very interesting new engine designs suggest that it could be done in two months. But based on technology that’s ready to go, it would take astronauts six months to travel to Mars and six months back to Earth.Astronauts havealready stayedfor this long on the International Space Station (ISS) and on the Soviet orbiting lab Mir. We can get there safely and we have already shown that we can reliably land robots on the surface. There’s no technical reason why we couldn’t do the same with humans.Second, Marsis abundantin theraw materialsrequired for humans to “live off the land”, in other words, achieve a level of self sufficiency. The red planet has plentiful carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen which can be separated and isolated, using processes developed on Earth. Mars is interesting and useful in a multitude of ways that the moon isn’t. And we have technology on Earth to enable us to stay and settle Mars by making use of its materials.A third reason for Mars optimism is the radical new technology that we can put to use on a crewed mission to the planet. For example,Moxie(Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment) is an project developed by scientists at theCaliforniaInstitute of Technology (Caltech) that sucks in Martian atmosphere andseparates it into oxygen. Byproducts of the process – carbon monoxide, nitrogen and argon – can be vented.When scaled up, similar machines would be able to separate oxygen from hydrogen to produce breathable air, rocket fuel and water. This makes it easier to travel to the planet and live on the surface because it’s not necessary to bring these commodities from Earth – they can be made once on Mars. Generating fuel on the surface would also make any future habitat less reliant on electric or solar-powered vehicles.But how would we build the habitats for our Mars settlers? Space architect Melodie Yasherhas developedingenious plans for using robots to 3D print the habitats, landing pads and everything needed for human life on Mars. Using robots means that these could all be manufactured on Mars before humans landed. 3D printed homes have already been demonstrated on Earth.Volunteers have also spent time living in simulated Mars habitats here on Earth. These are known as Mars analogues. The emergency medicine doctor Beth Healey spent a year overwintering in Antarctica (which offers many parallels with living on another planet) for the European Space Agency (Esa) andcommunicates her experienceregularly.She is not alone, as each year sees new projects in caves, deserts and other extreme environments, where long term studies can explore the physical and psychological demands on humans living in such isolated environments.Finally, theMars Direct plandevised by Dr Robert Zubrin has existed for more than 30 years, and has been modified to account for modern technology as the private sector has grown. The original plan was based on using a Saturn V rocket (used for the Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s) to launch people. However, this can now be accomplished using the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and a SpaceX Dragon capsule to carry crew members.Elon Musk wants to use his Starship vehicle to establish large settlements on Mars.SpaceX,CC BY-NCSeveral uncrewed launches from Earth could ferry necessary equipment to Mars. These could include a vehicle for crew members to return on. This means that everything could be ready for the first crew once they arrived.For astronauts making the journey to Mars, radiation is the biggest problem. But using certainmaterials in the wallsof the spacecraft or building a protective shelter inside the vehicle could shield astronauts from high energy particles. Similar ideas could apply to 3D printed habitats on the Martian surface. Alternatively, settlers could live underground or in Martian caves.On Mars, there’s a 24-minute communication delay with Earth. This means that Martians will need to be self-sustaining and less reliant on their homeworld from the beginning. While this could pose challenges, they are not insurmountable.Elon Musk’sStarship vehicle, which launches on the most powerful rocket ever built, could be a game changer. Starship is currently undergoing testing at SpaceX’s facility in southern Texas. It is hard to overstate what a reliable Starship, that has been cleared to carry humans, could do for exploration of the moon and Mars.Lower costs, higher payloads and larger crews all make for a far more efficient programme of lunar and Martian exploration. Yet even without it, everything we need to travel to Mars is currently available or in exciting late stages of development. There will not be a shortage of well-suited astronauts eager to go.Sam McKee, Associate Tutor and PhD Candidate in Philosophy of Science,Manchester Metropolitan UniversityThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

As a kid, I didn’t get whatever subversive message there was to the song, and I couldn’t quite make out any of the lyrics besides the titular refrain. I just unironically resonated with the headline sentiment and the stylized mechanistic musical arrangement, with processed vocals.The opening Russian-English lines (the group was German, so I don’t know why the song is in Russian+English) go:Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when publishedЯ твой слуга [I am your servant]
Я твой работник [I'm your employee]Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when publishedWe're charging our battery
And now we're full of energy
We are the robots
We are the robots...The song has an associated music video, featuring the band members playing their instruments with stereotypically robotic movements and flat affects:The funny thing about human impressions of robots these days is that actual robots don’t move in stereotypically machinic ways anymore, or make stereotypically machinic sounds.Advanced humanoid robots, such as those from Boston Dynamics (not the Tesla clanker1), move in much more fluid and organic ways, and can certainly dance human dances better than I can. Their sounds have a more complex musicality to them. Andallmachines, whether or not they are consciously designed in biomorphic ways, seem to be getting more idiomatically organic in how they are built and how they operate. They are even starting to exhibit emergent patterns of affect that feel organic. You can sense something like internal emotional states that rhyme with human ones like uncertainty, panic, and exhilaration for example. In modern robots, these are typically epiphenomena of functional behaviors rather than being designed in through some effort to engineer cosmetic “affective computing” features. A robot programmed with a sufficiently sophisticated exploration algorithm willlooklike it is exploring. It doesn’t need to be equipped with a designed “exploration face.”What should we make of the actual robot dance?Futuramapoints the way.There’s a really funny scene in the episodeFear of a Bot Planet(S1E6) where Bender the robot is befuddled by the humans doing the robot dance to help him celebrate “Robanukkah,” and goes, “hey, you guys are good! How the hell do you do that?” In the show, Bender himself aspires to be a country musician, and practices a rather human style of dancing that includes a move he calls “the Bender.”The robot dance is just the newest in a long tradition of dances that draw inspiration from mechanisms. In pre-modern dance forms, for instance, we find performance styles inspired by puppets, such as thewayang wongof Southeast Asia. Many traditional Indian dances are essentially stylized interpolation sequences between sculptural poses, which often have associated religious symbolism. The temple sculptures you see depicting dancers aren’t pure representations; they document, in a somewhat prescriptive way, the stylized poses that form the scaffolding of the dance forms themselves. I suspect the dance and sculptural traditions co-evolved. In a documentary I watched long ago, a classical Indian dancer described the differences among styles as follows: Bharatanatyam uses straight-line movements between poses, Kathak uses circles, and Kuchupudi uses arcs. This is how roboticists talk. Or used to, in the pre-deep-learning era.The robot, which Bender struggled to grok, is a dance from the 80s, and today is incorporated into the popping genre, which itself is derived from the the older (60s?) boogaloo genre, from which modern hip-hop dancing is also descended. Boogaloo, like classical Indian dances, is based on interpolation between poses, held statically for a beat or two. The distinct element appears to be the bit of exaggerated jitter or dangling exhibited when entering or exiting poses, which clearly reveals that observations of machinery starting and stopping abruptly, and underactuated parts swinging, provided the inspiration.It is important to note, however, that whatever the particular technological era that inspires a dance style — sculpture, puppetry, monumental architecture (the modern dance pioneered by Isadora Duncan) or 20th century machinery — it says almost nothing abouttechnologyper se. But it does say a lot about the humanattractionto the machinic. The underlying sentiment of theKraftwerkvideo and song is the exception. Generally, our cultural performances seek to mimic the contemporary machinic because the aesthetics of machine states (poses) and movementsappealsto us, not because they represent oppression and control.Affinity, not alienation, defines the default evolving relationship between the organic and machinic. The machinic as contiguous with the organic, rather than representing a hostile Other separated from it by an unbridgeable gap. A mode available to the artist as much as to the engineer, for incorporation into experimentally expanded senses of being.Machinic StereotypesMuch of what we might call the machinic aesthetic in modern culture reflects the workings of a particular narrow class of machines: Those whose behaviors are governed by discrete state transitions between stable static states. The machinic aesthetic is a set ofstereotypesbecause actual machines, increasingly, do not conform to them.Sculpture is of course the simplest and mathematically most degenerate example. A traditional static sculpture or piece of statuary is a technological artifact whose governing state machine features a single state and no transitions. Puppetry, depending on the style, involves many more static states and a few dynamic ones (depictions of horseback fighting in Rajasthani puppetry, for example, involve wild pendular swinging). It’s less obvious in music, but the music ofKraftwerkclearly draws inspirations from the sounds of machinery. Many modern musical genres have a generally syncopated state-transition quality to them, while genres that have a nostalgic vibe tend to be smoother and more flowing. This is a distinct machinic evolutionary trend, not to be confused with the more familiar trend towards increasing dissonance.The machinic aesthetic in the arts is inspired by machines, obviously, but it’s worth taking a closer look at the specifics of whymachinesbehave like machines. Where do machinic stereotypes come from?Industrial-age machines feature a lot of orthonormal movement axes (due to the limitations of rotary and piston parts, and machined contact surfaces), connecting states that are stabilized by mechanical stops, spring-loaded bumpers, and so on. Simpler control techniques and less capable actuators (like pneumatic) produce abrupt, jarring motion primitives, and force a separation of translational and rotational movements. More sophisticated control techniques and hardware allow for primitives that feature smooth accelerations and decelerations, and simultaneous translations and rotations.Artistic aspiration can gallop ahead of available technological inspiration. In an interview aboutRobocop,the classic 80s movie, Peter Weller, who played the titular cyborg cop, revealed that he and his choreographer actually came up with a style of slinky, curvy motion primitives that the rigid robocop suit did not allow him to use. So sadly the character moves like an old-fashioned jarring-orthonormal-primitives machine because of technical limitations, not lack of artistic imagination. I’d really like to see a reboot with the original movement style they’d come up with. I bet we can do actual physical suits now (not just CGI) that would allow for the original artistic vision.From the way Weller described the stillborn robocop motion grammar that never made it to the screen, the inspiration was likely the precise multi-input/multi-output servo-mechanisms controlled by digital controllers that began entering the industrial workplace in the late 70s. Machines using such mechanisms tend to make complex smooth humming sounds when they move, rather than clanking, whirring and thumping sounds, and can produce fairly arbitrary motion primitives (since they can move and turn in multiple dimensions at once). They also have less of a state-to-state pose-interpolation “locking” operating style, and look more like they’re flowing smoothly, dynamically, and not very repetitively, only pausing where they actually need to.The takeaway from this particular example is that artists, like engineers, often move with, or even ahead of, machinic evolution. The people who are bound by obsolete machinic stereotypes are typically ones who neither work with machines, nor observe them closely for artistic inspiration. They have a primitivist urge to look away instead.If you are paying attention, you’ll know that machines are rapidly evolving past the pose-to-pose transition/interpolation manner of operation that historically provided the inspiration for machine-inspired art. The flowing, organic quality we associate with “nature” and “naturalistic” arts is now better embodied by machines.Machines that FlowIn modern mechanical engineering, any motion curve and velocity profile you can define mathematically in a computer program, you can now produce with a suitably expressive machine. The movement can also integrate feedback from sensors, and accommodate large variations in how work inputs present themselves. This creates an increasingly flowing, organic quality to how modern machines operate.The challenge isn’t actuation of particular limbs and joints, but macro-stability of the whole, given everything you could “say” with a given set of motion primitives. The robotics lab I worked in as a postdoc at Cornell pioneered the use of precisely such complex motion primitives (computed using calculus of variations techniques that require modern computers) for robotic soccer contests. They dominated the contest for years because the other teams continued to use stereotypically robotic grid-based motion primitives, with decoupled translations and rotations. I suspect state-of-the-art wheeled soccer robots could already defeat human soccer players. Humanoid soccer robots will take a while longer. Within human-like constraints of speed and power, the human body is not actually the best machine for playing soccer, anymore than it is the best machine for playing chess, or cranking widgets on an industrial-era assembly line.In industry, CNC machines (which are simpler than robots) hadalreadyfar exceeded the limits of human dexterity by the 80s. Human machinists can typically only control one movement dimension with any precision. Operating a lathe, for instance, only requires you to move the bit precisely in the radial direction, and somewhat coarsely in the axial direction. Humans can only produce simpler geometries with a 2d milling machine. More complex geometries require computer control. Milling operations under computer control machining complex parts often have a flowing quality to them. They can be mesmerizing to watch.In robotics, an emerging example of the rise of flowing, organic operating qualities can be found in drones (which are simpler than ground-based robots in many ways). Early drones, about 20 years ago, were being programmed using what are known asmaneuver automata.This was done by having expert human pilots fly the drones around using remote controllers, and recording the maneuvers (such as barrel rolls) that transitioned between trim states (states like steady forward flight). These then supplied the grammar and vocabulary of motion that autopilots could use, modeled using sophisticated mathematical frameworks (automata theory, Lie algebras…). The limit again was math and computation, not mechanics. Drones programmed this way had a clear “pose-to-pose” quality to how they flew.But more recently, drones are being programmed to fly in ways no humans could fly. And this isn’t just a matter of higher g-forces or tighter turning radii achievable with unpiloted vehicles. Not only can machines now produce motions that no humans can produce (directly with their bodies, or indirectly through pilot controls), no humans can evenconceiveof them. It takes machine learning to discover and grammatize higher-order motion primitives that exploit the full mobility envelope of a given machine. And the result is motion languages that are increasingly beyond the human brain to learn. Motion languages that flow in ways where humans can’t easily perceive the underlying boundaries between primitives, and governing grammars.We are reaching the limits of the ability of the organic to conceive of, grok, or imitate the machinic, even symbolically or allegorically, through art. Yet, paradoxically, machines are looking more organic than ever.HyperorganicityThe evolutionary tendency of machines, given improving material and computational capabilities, is not towards perfection of static human notions of the machinic (artistically mimicked or conceptually modeled), but towards thehyperorganic.By hyperorganic, I mean an evolutionary mode that drives increasing complexity along both machinic and organic dimensions. This gives us machines from qualitatively distinct evolutionary design regimes. Machines that exhibit organic idioms but defy comparisons with specific biological organisms, andalsoexhibit alien aspects thatdon’tfit organic idioms.This is not as complicated a point as it might seem. The ball-and-socket joint is idiomatically organic (your hip joint is an example). The (macro-scale) wheel-and-axle is idiomatically machinic. A machine that features a ball-and-socket joint more complex than any natural example,andwheels, would count as hyperorganic. Certain Boston Dynamic robots are already there.Karl Schroeder observed that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from nature (a snowclone of Arthur C. Clarke’s line about magic). This is likely too weak a proposition now. Technology gets to parity with the organic, in terms of informational complexity, then begins to go past it to hyperorganic regimes. And art sometimes leads the evolution and points the way there. The anticipation of flowing motions by Robocop is one example. Another is in AI. I readsome speculationthat the depiction of alien language inArrivalwas part of the inspiration of the transformers architecture underlying much of modern AI, which is ironic given author Ted Chiang’s turn against AI. I don’t quite buy the theory (technological origins are neverthatsimple) but it’s hilarious and fun-to-believe origin story.Today’s robots are much more flowing and organic than stereotypically machinic robots that whose movements resemble the robot dance. They will soon be hyperorganic as advances in soft materials, weird actuators, and AI-discovered motion languages continue. The hyperorganic future is arriving not just linguistically, butmaterially.We tend to miss this dynamic because we identify most easily with technology thatvisiblyhas roughly the complexity of human self-models. We harbor contempt for technology that is simpler than we perceive ourselves to be (unless you’re a particular sort of mystic seeking to become one with a simple tool like a sword or hammer), and fear of technology that is more complex.While this is most obvious with technologies that reproduce, automate, or surpass human functions and behaviors in legible ways (most obviously humanoid robots), this is actually true of all technology, including technologies that do things humans never did, like fly.Consider airplanes. Most airplane enthusiasts resonate most strongly with airplanes from the era where the gross morphology of aircraft was human-like in complexity (World War II). Airplanes through World War I were too simple and contraptiony. They did not have the cohesion and humanish contraption factor (ratio of complexity to design integrity) to allow us to identify strongly with them. But at the other extreme, modern airplanes all look strangely similar, falling into far fewer geometric varieties than WW 2, andtoocohesive and monolithic. For example, the “flying wing” design is hard to project a 4-limbed primate bodily identity onto, compared to say a WW2 fighter. WW2 aircraft represent an anthropomorphic identification sweet-spot.One sign: It is far harder to individually identify modern aircraft, compared to WW2 aircraft, unless you really the subtle details to look for. Aerodynamically, they have converged to a few deceptively simple forms, beneath which a lot of invisible and non-human complexity and machinic design integrity lurks (I suspect this convergence is about to be reversed, by the way, by an explosion of new hyperorganic flyable forms).The case of stealthairplanes is illuminating and worth a detour. The original stealth fighter, the F-117, has a weird, clunky appearance, full of strangely intersecting flat planes. Nobody I know finds it to be attractive. It looks like a contraption because it is. But not for the reasons you might think. The plane looks the way it does because computers in the 70s and 80s were not powerful enough to do complex ray-tracing to minimize radar profiles. So they solved for “low-poly” profiles. Later generations of stealth aircraft could rely both on better computers and better materials to engineer stealth features without sacrificing aerodynamics. So the airplanes have returned to the trajectory of increasingly smooth, aerodynamic profiles they were on. Once again, the limiting factor was computing, not mechanical imagination. The ugly Tesla cybertruck supposedly looks the way it does because of the difficulties in constructing automotive bodies out of stainless steel. But I suspect in that case, there is also a deliberately reactionary machinic aesthetic at play.  On the plus side, it has hyperorganic maneuverability, thanks to the first automotive use of fly-by-wire type controls.There is a sublimated sort of anthropomorphism at work in stories like this. A machine does not need to look obviously anthropomorphic for us to project our identities onto it. It does not even need obviously humanistic pareidolia-fodder elements, such as headlights that can be mapped to eyes. The necessary (and likely sufficient) condition is that it presents with a complexity comparable to human self-models in visual (or more generally, visual-auditory) modes. We trust and identify with machines that can be unbundled similarly to how we unbundle ourselves. This typically means about 7±2 visual lumps to the morphology for example (the so called “magic number), and operating principles summarizable at the level of (say), “id, ego, superego” theories of the psyche. Steam engines are easier to identify with than electric motors, which in turn are easier to identify with than gas turbines.We might say that humans like machines that are informationallyimpedance matchedto human self-models.Hyperorganic AsymptotesA thing — whether organic or machinic — can of course be vastly more complex than human self-models, both structurally and behaviorally. Things that are more structurally complex present asstatically inscrutableeven when they aren’t doing anything. A good example is the exposed plumbing and wiring in the cross-section of a rocket booster, such as that of the Saturn V that you can see at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Another good example is the innards of a modern CPU. Or an aerial view of a modern metropolis.Things that are more behaviorally complex present aschaoticeven if they’re not. The rhythms of early industrial era factories were pleasing, even if high-tempo. You can vaguely sense the exciting orderliness of activities in progress. They were legible enough to sustain humor, such as the famous scene of Lucy working the accelerating chocolate production assembly line. But the rhythms of modern technologies, such as the view of evolving software presented by the evolving state of code repositories (there are several excellent visualizations) look chaotic. Even experienced programmers struggle to get attuned to them. Making widely accessible jokes about software projects is harder than making jokes about industrial factories.We typically react to both static inscrutability and chaotic dynamics with anxiety, and in extreme cases, even with terror or horror. And the more hyperorganic technology gets, the worse it gets.In a post a few months ago, I tagged one flavor of the horror —fear of oozification. Oozification — evolution towards gray goo that simultaneously seems like a regression to primordial ooze and progress towards alien intelligence — is one asymptote of evolution of the machinic towards the hyperorganic.Another asymptote is towardsmonolithicity,which I wrote about in another post. Where ooze evokes a kind of primordial horror based on what is hyper-present,the monolithic can, under some conditions, inspire terror based on what isvisiblyabsent(htLincoln Michelfor this distinction). Terrifying conditions obtain, I think, at the intersection of monolithicity andmonumentality,which, asI argued a couple of weeks ago, is about proportions rather than scale. But when monumental proportions coincide with monolithicity and particular scales, you can evoke terror. In movies, this is often depicted through platonic-primitive imagery. The mysterious alien orb. The blocky robot inInterstellar.The smooth pyramid. The impossibly large cube.What can make this terrifying is that there are clear signs of great complexitysomewhere,butnoneof it is visible.  The scales being either epic, or worryingly small, establish a worrying distance from human scales, and signal either terrifying magnitude or density of latent powers.A third asymptote of hyperorganicity is what we might callhypermodularity.When a technology presents as Lego-like composable blocks, but the visible grammar and vocabulary are clearlytoo simpleto account for what is going on.If you were swarmed by a bunch of different levitating parts that had different shapes and coupled in complicated but comprehensible ways (think Iron Man’s suit), you might try to figure out the underlying assembly logic and hack it. But if you were swarmed by (say) a bunch of featureless levitating cubes that seem to self-assemble into weird alien geometries, hinting at advanced group theory beyond human mathematical capabilities, you’d possibly be terrified.Humans are attracted to the machinic while it is evolving through the particular range of complexity that is our own range of self-models, with much of the visible complexity in idiomatically organic rather than machinic dimensions. We like mirror-like machines that offer us simplified, but still recognizable reflections of ourselves. With perhaps a bit of an imitable machinic aspect that we can incorporate into our own sense of ourselves.Machinic MirrorsOur simplistic self-models, of course, don’t exhaust our own actual complexity. As emergent meatbags comprising billions of cells, entire microbiomes within our bodies, and a range of engineering complexity that exceeds the span of semiconductors to space stations,of course,we aren’t accurately modeled or constrained by (say)id-ego-superegograde psyche models orDasein-grade metaphysics, any more than our bodies are accurately modeled by stick-figure drawings.Any such radically limited model of Being/mind/body can only be alimitingself-perception. Living in ways that feel true to such limiting self-perceptions is what we declare to beauthentic.Technology that allows us to live in more complex ways without falling apart profanes not our literal biological natures — anything our bodies can do without irreversible damage or death is arguably legal in an engineering sense — but these limiting self-perceptions.Over one lifetime, we don’t update or evolve our self models much. Over multiple generations, however, we do. So machines that provoke anxiety in older adults do not provoke such anxieties in younger adults who imprint on more complex self-models at formative stages of young adulthood. Douglas Adams’ 3 rules of technology capture this effect:Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.If you apply this idea alongside the tendency towards hyperorganicity in machines, you get a co-evolutionary model, where each successive generation gazes upon its reflection in a richer machinic mirror, and locks on to a more expressive organic identity.Machinic mirrors drive our evolving human sense of being human.Your self-models tend to form and ossify between 15-35, and because the machinic tends to evolve towards and past the organic, older people look more stereotypically machinic, and less human, than you perceive yourself to be. And younger people appear more dissolute, presenting both inscrutable structure and chaotic behavior. Co-evolving with technology means all generations are inclined to view olderandyounger generations as dehumanized. Every generation views itself as the peak of humanness. Only the youngest generation living generation is likely to be right.Douglas Adams’ three laws require a caveat though — you only imprint on contemporary technology if the world appears to be broadly improving and technology appears to be contributing to that impression based on casual impressions. In other words, you have tolikewhat you see in the machinic mirror when you’re ready to lock-in an identity.Note that onlycasualimpressions matter here. Arguments, sound or not, about whether or not technology is actually improving the world are moot. When contemporary technologyappearsto be contributing broadly to anapparentimprovement of the world, more young people imprint on it and develop corresponding self-models. When the world appears to be in decline, and technology appears to be contributing to that decline, more young people are tempted into a reactionary turn. Often they turn more reactionary than living older generations. There are at least some signs that this is true of significant segments of Gen Z.This can lead to weird retrograde periods in cultural evolution. Two British movies, both featuring Om Puri, portray this phenomenon. InEast is East,he plays a conservative Muslim father dealing with a progressive son. InMy Son the Fanatic,he plays a liberal Muslim father dealing with son who has turned to fundamentalism.The evolution of human self-models is not necessarily monotonic in the medium term, even if in the long term it drives us towards an increasingly complex sense of our own humanity.Nowhere is this clearer than in the most complex machines we build — organizations. Aging GenX and Boomer managers demand a return to 9-5 work, struggle to address low motivation, have no good ideas for dealing with “quiet quitting,” and declare meaning crises. It is effectively a demand that we put on primitive suits and return to an older ideal of stereotypically robotic work. And many in Gen Z seem eager to transform themselves into stereotypical robots and comply.Meanwhile younger founders adopt more fluid org forms, cheerfully organize in seemingly inchoate structures and behaviors, and build little subcultures that seem remarkably free of the “meaning crisis” their reactionary peers and fearful parents clutch pearls about. They too are modeling themselves on robots, except that these are the emerging hyperorganic, swarming ones that don’t do the robot dance.1The very underwhelming Tesla humanoid “robot” (apparently still human controlled, so really more of an autonomous cyborg suit) was labeled a clanker derisively by critics, and the term clanker has since found notoriety as the name of an AI bot that allows you to launch memecoins on blockchains. Ironically,thisclanker is actually a lot more organic in its behavior, though not in a humanoid way.40Share this postContraptionsWe Are the RobotsCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMore10SharePreviousNextDiscussion about this postCommentsRestacksTopLatestDiscussionsNo postsReady for more?Subscribe© 2024 Venkatesh RaoPrivacy∙Terms∙Collection noticeStart WritingGet the appSubstackis the home for great cultureShareCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

episodefear of a bot planetse where bender the robot is befuddled by the humans doing the robot dance to help him celebrate robanukkah and goes hey you guys are good how the hell do you do that in the show bender himself aspires to be a country musician and practices a rather human style of dancing that includes a move he calls the benderthe robot dance is just the newest in a long tradition of dances that draw inspiration from mechanisms in premodern dance forms for instance we find performance styles inspired by puppets such as thewayang wongof southeast asia many traditional indian dances are essentially stylized interpolation sequences between sculptural poses which often have associated religious symbolism the temple sculptures you see depicting dancers arent pure representations they document in a somewhat prescriptive way the stylized poses that form the scaffolding of the dance forms themselves i suspect the dance and sculptural traditions coevolved in a documentary i watched long ago a classical indian dancer described the differences among styles as follows bharatanatyam uses straightline movements between poses kathak uses circles and kuchupudi uses arcs this is how roboticists talk or used to in the predeeplearning erathe robot which bender struggled to grok is a dance from the s and today is incorporated into the popping genre which itself is derived from the the older s boogaloo genre from which modern hiphop dancing is also descended boogaloo like classical indian dances is based on interpolation between poses held statically for a beat or two the distinct element appears to be the bit of exaggerated jitter or dangling exhibited when entering or exiting poses which clearly reveals that observations of machinery starting and stopping abruptly and underactuated parts swinging provided the inspirationit is important to note however that whatever the particular technological era that inspires a dance style sculpture puppetry monumental architecture the modern dance pioneered by isadora duncan or th century machinery it says almost nothing abouttechnologyper se but it does say a lot about the humanattractionto the machinic the underlying sentiment of thekraftwerkvideo and song is the exception generally our cultural performances seek to mimic the contemporary machinic because the aesthetics of machine states poses and movementsappealsto us not because they represent oppression and controlaffinity not alienation defines the default evolving relationship between the organic and machinic the machinic as contiguous with the organic rather than representing a hostile other separated from it by an unbridgeable gap a mode available to the artist as much as to the engineer for incorporation into experimentally expanded senses of beingmachinic stereotypesmuch of what we might call the machinic aesthetic in modern culture reflects the workings of a particular narrow class of machines those whose behaviors are governed by discrete state transitions between stable static states the machinic aesthetic is a set ofstereotypesbecause actual machines increasingly do not conform to themsculpture is of course the simplest and mathematically most degenerate example a traditional static sculpture or piece of statuary is a technological artifact whose governing state machine features a single state and no transitions puppetry depending on the style involves many more static states and a few dynamic ones depictions of horseback fighting in rajasthani puppetry for example involve wild pendular swinging its less obvious in music but the music ofkraftwerkclearly draws inspirations from the sounds of machinery many modern musical genres have a generally syncopated statetransition quality to them while genres that have a nostalgic vibe tend to be smoother and more flowing this is a distinct machinic evolutionary trend not to be confused with the more familiar trend towards increasing dissonancethe machinic aesthetic in the arts is inspired by machines obviously but its worth taking a closer look at the specifics of whymachinesbehave like machines where do machinic stereotypes come fromindustrialage machines feature a lot of orthonormal movement axes due to the limitations of rotary and piston parts and machined contact surfaces connecting states that are stabilized by mechanical stops springloaded bumpers and so on simpler control techniques and less capable actuators like pneumatic produce abrupt jarring motion primitives and force a separation of translational and rotational movements more sophisticated control techniques and hardware allow for primitives that feature smooth accelerations and decelerations and simultaneous translations and rotationsartistic aspiration can gallop ahead of available technological inspiration in an interview aboutrobocopthe classic s movie peter weller who played the titular cyborg cop revealed that he and his choreographer actually came up with a style of slinky curvy motion primitives that the rigid robocop suit did not allow him to use so sadly the character moves like an oldfashioned jarringorthonormalprimitives machine because of technical limitations not lack of artistic imagination id really like to see a reboot with the original movement style theyd come up with i bet we can do actual physical suits now not just cgi that would allow for the original artistic visionfrom the way weller described the stillborn robocop motion grammar that never made it to the screen the inspiration was likely the precise multiinputmultioutput servomechanisms controlled by digital controllers that began entering the industrial workplace in the late s machines using such mechanisms tend to make complex smooth humming sounds when they move rather than clanking whirring and thumping sounds and can produce fairly arbitrary motion primitives since they can move and turn in multiple dimensions at once they also have less of a statetostate poseinterpolation locking operating style and look more like theyre flowing smoothly dynamically and not very repetitively only pausing where they actually need tothe takeaway from this particular example is that artists like engineers often move with or even ahead of machinic evolution the people who are bound by obsolete machinic stereotypes are typically ones who neither work with machines nor observe them closely for artistic inspiration they have a primitivist urge to look away insteadif you are paying attention youll know that machines are rapidly evolving past the posetopose transitioninterpolation manner of operation that historically provided the inspiration for machineinspired art the flowing organic quality we associate with nature and naturalistic arts is now better embodied by machinesmachines that flowin modern mechanical engineering any motion curve and velocity profile you can define mathematically in a computer program you can now produce with a suitably expressive machine the movement can also integrate feedback from sensors and accommodate large variations in how work inputs present themselves this creates an increasingly flowing organic quality to how modern machines operatethe challenge isnt actuation of particular limbs and joints but macrostability of the whole given everything you could say with a given set of motion primitives the robotics lab i worked in as a postdoc at cornell pioneered the use of precisely such complex motion primitives computed using calculus of variations techniques that require modern computers for robotic soccer contests they dominated the contest for years because the other teams continued to use stereotypically robotic gridbased motion primitives with decoupled translations and rotations i suspect stateoftheart wheeled soccer robots could already defeat human soccer players humanoid soccer robots will take a while longer within humanlike constraints of speed and power the human body is not actually the best machine for playing soccer anymore than it is the best machine for playing chess or cranking widgets on an industrialera assembly linein industry cnc machines which are simpler than robots hadalreadyfar exceeded the limits of human dexterity by the s human machinists can typically only control one movement dimension with any precision operating a lathe for instance only requires you to move the bit precisely in the radial direction and somewhat coarsely in the axial direction humans can only produce simpler geometries with a d milling machine more complex geometries require computer control milling operations under computer control machining complex parts often have a flowing quality to them they can be mesmerizing to watchin robotics an emerging example of the

organic identitymachinic mirrors drive our evolving human sense of being humanyour selfmodels tend to form and ossify between  and because the machinic tends to evolve towards and past the organic older people look more stereotypically machinic and less human than you perceive yourself to be and younger people appear more dissolute presenting both inscrutable structure and chaotic behavior coevolving with technology means all generations are inclined to view olderandyounger generations as dehumanized every generation views itself as the peak of humanness only the youngest generation living generation is likely to be rightdouglas adams three laws require a caveat though you only imprint on contemporary technology if the world appears to be broadly improving and technology appears to be contributing to that impression based on casual impressions in other words you have tolikewhat you see in the machinic mirror when youre ready to lockin an identitynote that

anapparentimprovement of the world more young people imprint on it and develop corresponding selfmodels when the world appears to be in decline and technology appears to be contributing to that decline more young people are tempted into a reactionary turn often they turn more reactionary than living older generations there are at least some signs that this is true of significant segments of

boomer managers demand a return to  work struggle to address low motivation have no good ideas for dealing with quiet quitting and declare meaning crises it is effectively a demand that we put on primitive suits and return to an older ideal of stereotypically robotic work and many in gen z seem eager to transform themselves into stereotypical robots and complymeanwhile younger founders adopt

tool EagleMsgSpy used by Chinese law enforcementPierluigi PaganiniDecember 12, 2024Chinese law enforcement uses the mobile surveillance tool EagleMsgSpy to gather data from Android devices, as detailed by Lookout.Researchers at theLookout Threat Labdiscovered a surveillance tool, dubbed EagleMsgSpy, used by Chinese law enforcement to spy on mobile devices. The researchers analyzed multiple samples of the malware and gained access to internal documents obtained from open directories on attacker infrastructure. These documents suggest the existence of an iOS conversion of the spyware that has yet to be uncovered.The surveillance tool family has been active since 2017, the experts highlighted that it requires physical access to the target device to initiate operations. The surveillance software is composed of an installer APK, and a surveillance client that runs headlessly on the device when installed. Law enforcement would use the installer component to deploy the headless surveillance module, which collects sensitive data. Neither the installer nor the payload has been found in app stores like Google Play.“EagleMsgSpy is a lawful intercept surveillance tool developed by a Chinese software development company with use by public security bureaus in mainland China.” reads thereportpublished by Lookout. “Early samples indicate the surveillance tool has been operational since at least 2017, with development continued into late 2024.”The surveillance tool, likely used by multiple customers, collects extensive data from victim devices, including messages from various apps (QQ, Telegram, Viber, WhatsApp, WeChat), screen recordings, screenshots, audio, contacts, call logs, GPS coordinates, and more. The tool encrypts data before exfiltrate it to a command-and-control server. The tool is actively maintained, with increasing use of obfuscation to evade detection.The IP address of one of the C2 servers used by the surveillance tool has been linked to Wuhan Chinasoft Token Information Technology Co., Ltd., a Chinese tech company founded in 2016 with fewer than 50 employees. Lookout believes the company developed and maintains the tool, which is being used by several public security bureaus in mainland China.The researchers also reported that EagleMsgSpy shares infrastructure with other Chinese surveillance tools, includingPluginPhantomand CarbonSteal, used in campaigns linked to other APT groups. The IP address 202.107.80[.]34 linked to PluginPhantom, and 119.36.193[.]210 tied to CarbonSteal, has been used in campaigns targeting minorities in China. Overlap in infrastructure and code has been observed across these tools, including Silkbean, HenBox, and DarthPusher.“EagleMsgSpy is a lawful intercept surveillance tool developed by Wuhan Chinasoft Token Information Technology Co., Ltd. (武汉中软通证信息技术有限公司) used by public security bureaus in mainland China. The malware is placed on victim devices and configured through access to the unlocked victim device.” concludes the report. “Once installed, the headless payload runs in the background, hiding its activities from the user of the device and collects extensive data from the user. Public CFPs for similar systems indicate that this surveillance tool or analogous systems are in use by many public security bureaus in China.”Follow me on Twitter:@securityaffairsandFacebookandMastodonPierluigi Paganini(SecurityAffairs–hacking, China)facebooklinkedintwitterEagleMsgSpyHackinghacking newsinformation security newsIT Information SecuritymalwaremobilePierluigi PaganiniSecurity AffairsSecurity Newssurveillanceyou might also likePierluigi PaganiniDecember 21, 2024Romanian national was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in NetWalker ransomware attacksRead morePierluigi PaganiniDecember 20, 2024Sophos fixed critical vulnerabilities in its Firewall productRead moreleave a commentnewsletterSubscribe to my email list and stayup-to-date!recent articlesRomanian national was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in NetWalker ransomware attacksCyber Crime/December 21, 2024Sophos fixed critical vulnerabilities in its Firewall productSecurity/December 20, 2024U.S. CISA adds BeyondTrust software flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalogSecurity/December 20, 2024Raccoon Infostealer operator sentenced to 60 months in prisonCyber Crime/December 20, 2024Mirai botnet targets SSR devices, Juniper Networks warnsMalware/December 19, 2024To contact me write an email to:Pierluigi Paganini :[email protected]LEARN MOREQUICK LINKSHomeCyber CrimeCyber warfareAPTData BreachDeep WebDigital IDHackingHacktivismIntelligenceInternet of ThingsLaws and regulationsMalwareMobileReportsSecuritySocial NetworksTerrorismICS-SCADAPOLICIESContact meCopyright@securityaffairs 2024We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

programmerPierluigi PaganiniDecember 07, 2024Russia’s FSB used spyware against a Russian programmer after detaining him for allegedly donating to Ukraine earlier this year.The Federal Security Service (FSB) used spyware to monitor a Russian programmer, Kirill Parubets, after he was detained earlier this year for allegedly donating to Ukraine.Researchers from theFirst Departmentand theCitizen Labdiscovered that the Russian intelligence agency installed the malware on the programmer’s Android device after he was detained for 15 days.During the detention, authorities seized the programmer’s device, an Oukitel WP7 phone running Android 10, and installed spyware on it.“This joint investigation withFirst Department, a legal assistance organization, found spyware covertly implanted on a phone returned to a Russian programmer accused of sending money to Ukraine after he was released from custody.” reads thereportpublished by Citizen Lab. “The spyware bears many similarities to theMonoklefamily of spyware,previously reported on by Lookout Mobile Security, which they attribute to the “Special Technology Center,” a contractor to the Russian government.”In June 2024, Parubets reported toFirst Departmentthat during a 15-day administrative detention authorities confiscated his Android device. Parubets disclosed that his apartment was searched, and he was beaten to force him to reveal his device password.The spyware allowed Russian authorities to track a target device’s location, record phone calls, and keystrokes, and read messages from encrypted messaging apps.Kirill Parubets and his spouse were detained, during which the FSB pressured him to become an informant, threatening life imprisonment if he refused. The FSB showed significant interest in his work and connections, including ties to Ukraine.After Parubets was released, his phone was returned at the FSB’s Lubyanka headquarters. He noticed suspicious behavior, including an unusual notification, “Arm cortex vx3 synchronization,” which is not standard for the device. A subsequent analysis by The First Department identified a likely-malicious app installed during his detention. Then, the First Department requested the support of Citizen Lab to investigate the device.The analysis of the Android device revealed that Russian intelligence installed on the device a trojanized version of the genuineCube Call Recorderapp. It’s worth noting that the legitimate app has the package name “com.catalinagroup.callrecorder,” whereas therogue counterpart’spackage name is “com.cortex.arm.vx3.”The spyware supports multiple functionalities through the extensive permissions it requests. The malicious code can access location data even when not in use, read and send SMS messages, install additional packages, and record screen captures. It can also read calendar entries, list installed applications, answer phone calls, retrieve account details, and record videos using the device’s camera.Moreover, the spyware retains some permissions also found in the genuine app, such as precise location tracking, recording phone calls, and accessing contact information, which are common functionalities in many spyware tools. These extended capabilities suggest that the malware aims for comprehensive surveillance of the target device.“Most of the malicious functionality of the application is contained in the class com.android.twe1ve, a class that is unique to this sample of spyware and not present in the Cube Call Recorder app available in the Google Play Store.” continues the report. “Most of the malicious functionality of the application is hidden in an encrypted second stage of the spyware. Once the spyware is loaded onto the phone and executed, the second stage is decrypted and loaded into memory. This type of obfuscation can help hide malicious activity from some antivirus software.”The second stage of the spyware expands its capabilities, integrating core Android libraries and open-source tools like RTMP for audio/video streaming and SMB for file uploads. Its functionality includes location tracking, screen capture, keylogging, call recording, file extraction, password retrieval, and reading messages from other apps. It can also add a new device administrator, inject JavaScript, execute shell commands, and extract the device’s unlock password.Additionally, it decrypts settings and data files stored in its assets directory. The researchers also noticed that the malicious code contains some references to iOS, suggesting a possible iPhone version of the spyware.“This case illustrates that the loss of physical custody of a device to a hostile security service like the FSB can be a severe risk for compromise that will extend beyond the period where the security services have custody of the device.” concludes the report that includes Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). “In this case, the target noticed several odd behaviors on their device after he was released from detention, such as an unfamiliar and suspicious notification and the presence of an app that he had not installed. However, not every attempt to infiltrate and monitor a device is likely to result in such visible alerts. “Follow me on Twitter:@securityaffairsandFacebookandMastodonPierluigi Paganini(SecurityAffairs–hacking, FSB)facebooklinkedintwitterAndroidFSBHackinghacking newsinformation security newsIT Information SecuritymalwarePierluigi PaganiniSecurity Affairsspywareyou might also likePierluigi PaganiniDecember 21, 2024Romanian national was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in NetWalker ransomware attacksRead morePierluigi PaganiniDecember 20, 2024Sophos fixed critical vulnerabilities in its Firewall productRead moreleave a commentnewsletterSubscribe to my email list and stayup-to-date!recent articlesRomanian national was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in NetWalker ransomware attacksCyber Crime/December 21, 2024Sophos fixed critical vulnerabilities in its Firewall productSecurity/December 20, 2024U.S. CISA adds BeyondTrust software flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalogSecurity/December 20, 2024Raccoon Infostealer operator sentenced to 60 months in prisonCyber Crime/December 20, 2024Mirai botnet targets SSR devices, Juniper Networks warnsMalware/December 19, 2024To contact me write an email to:Pierluigi Paganini :[email protected]LEARN MOREQUICK LINKSHomeCyber CrimeCyber warfareAPTData BreachDeep WebDigital IDHackingHacktivismIntelligenceInternet of ThingsLaws and regulationsMalwareMobileReportsSecuritySocial NetworksTerrorismICS-SCADAPOLICIESContact meCopyright@securityaffairs 2024We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

paganinidecember  russias fsb used spyware against a russian programmer after detaining him for allegedly donating to ukraine earlier this yearthe federal security service fsb used spyware to monitor a russian programmer kirill parubets after he was detained earlier this year for allegedly donating to ukraineresearchers from thefirst departmentand thecitizen labdiscovered that the russian intelligence agency installed the malware on the programmers android device after he was detained for  daysduring the detention authorities seized the programmers device an oukitel wp phone running android  and installed spyware on itthis joint investigation withfirst department a legal assistance organization found spyware covertly implanted on a phone returned to a russian programmer accused of sending money to ukraine after he was released from custody reads thereportpublished by citizen lab the spyware bears many similarities to themonoklefamily of spywarepreviously reported on by lookout mobile security which they attribute to the special technology center a contractor to the russian governmentin june  parubets reported tofirst departmentthat during a day administrative detention authorities confiscated his android device parubets disclosed that his apartment was searched and he was beaten to force him to reveal his device passwordthe spyware allowed russian authorities to track a target devices location record phone calls and keystrokes and read messages from encrypted messaging appskirill parubets and his spouse were detained during which the fsb pressured him to become an informant threatening life imprisonment if he refused the fsb showed significant interest in his work and connections including ties to ukraineafter parubets was released his phone was returned at the fsbs lubyanka headquarters he noticed suspicious behavior including an unusual notification arm cortex vx synchronization which is not standard for the device a subsequent analysis by the first department identified a likelymalicious app installed during his detention then the first department requested the support of citizen lab to investigate the devicethe analysis of the android device revealed that russian intelligence installed on the device a trojanized version of the genuinecube call recorderapp its worth noting that the legitimate app has the package name comcatalinagroupcallrecorder whereas therogue counterpartspackage name is comcortexarmvxthe spyware supports multiple functionalities through the extensive permissions it requests the malicious code can access location data even when not in use read and send sms messages install additional packages and record screen captures it can also read calendar entries list installed applications answer phone calls retrieve account details and record videos using the devices cameramoreover the spyware retains some permissions also found in the genuine app such as precise location tracking recording phone calls and accessing contact information which are common functionalities in many spyware tools these extended capabilities suggest that the malware aims for comprehensive surveillance of the target devicemost of the malicious functionality of the application is contained in the class comandroidtweve a class that is unique to this sample of spyware and not present in the cube call recorder app available in the google play store continues the report most of the malicious functionality of the application is hidden in an encrypted second stage of the spyware once the spyware is loaded onto the phone and executed the second stage is decrypted and loaded into memory this type of obfuscation can help hide malicious activity from some antivirus softwarethe second stage of the spyware expands its capabilities integrating core android libraries and opensource tools like rtmp for audiovideo streaming and smb for file uploads its functionality includes location tracking screen capture keylogging call recording file extraction password retrieval and reading messages from other apps it can also add a new device administrator inject javascript execute shell commands and extract the devices unlock passwordadditionally it decrypts settings and data files stored in its assets directory the researchers also noticed that the malicious code contains some references to ios suggesting a possible iphone version of the spywarethis case illustrates that the loss of physical custody of a device to a hostile security service like the fsb can be a severe risk for compromise that will extend beyond the period where the security services have custody of the device concludes the report that includes indicators of compromise iocs in this case the target noticed several odd behaviors on their device after he was released from detention such as an unfamiliar and suspicious notification and the presence of an app that he had not installed however not every attempt to infiltrate and monitor a device is likely to result in such visible alerts follow me on twittersecurityaffairsandfacebookandmastodonpierluigi paganinisecurityaffairshacking

mechanismsPierluigi PaganiniDecember 15, 2024Researchers discovered PUMAKIT, a Linux rootkit capable of hiding files, escalating privileges, and evading system tools and detection.Elastic Security Lab researchers discovered a new loadable kernel module (LKM) rootkit called PUMAKIT that supports advanced evasion mechanisms.PUMAKIT features a multi-stage design including a dropper, memory-resident executables, and a rootkit. It leverages an LKM rootkit named “PUMA,” using ftrace hooks to modify core system functions.The malware hooks 18 syscalls and several kernel functions usingftrace()to hide files, directories, and the rootkit itself, while evading debugging attempts.Developers focused on stealthy deployment, the malware activates only under specific conditions, such as secure boot checks or kernel symbol availability, embedding ELF binaries within its dropper.“PUMAKIT is a sophisticated piece of malware, initially uncovered during routine threat hunting on VirusTotal and named after developer-embedded strings found within its binary.” reads thereportpublished by Elastic Security Lab. “Key functionalities of the kernel module include privilege escalation, hiding files and directories, concealing itself from system tools, anti-debugging measures, and establishing communication with command-and-control (C2) servers.”The LKM rootkit uses the syscall table to manipulate system behavior and relies on kallsyms_lookup_name() for symbol resolution. Unlike rootkits that target kernel versions 5.7 and above, the rootkit component of PUMAKIT does not usekprobes, suggesting it is designed for older kernels.“This choice is significant because, prior to kernel version 5.7,kallsyms_lookup_name()was exported and could be easily leveraged by modules, even those without proper licensing.” continues the report.“In February 2020, kernel developers debated the unexporting ofkallsyms_lookup_name()to prevent misuse by unauthorized or malicious modules. A common tactic involved adding a fakeMODULE_LICENSE(""GPL"")declaration to circumvent licensing checks, allowing these modules to access non-exported kernel functions. The LKM rootkit demonstrates this behavior”Thermdir_hook()function in PUMAKIT’s kernel module interceptsrmdir()syscalls to manipulate directory operations. The malware uses it for privilege escalation and to retrieve configuration details based on a structured input pattern. The hook processes commands and arguments embedded in the syscall, starting with “zarya,” followed by command and argument characters. This structured system enhances control and concealment.Below is the list of commands processed by the hook:CommandPurposezarya.c.0Retrieve the configzarya.t.0Test the workingzarya.k.<pid>Hide a PIDzarya.v.0Get the running versionElastic Security developed aYARAsignature to detect PUMAKIT components, including the dropper (cron), rootkit loader (/memfd:wpn), LKM rootkit, and Kitsune shared object files.“PUMAKIT is a complex and stealthy threat that uses advanced techniques like syscall hooking, memory-resident execution, and unique privilege escalation methods. Its multi-architectural design highlights the growing sophistication of malware targeting Linux systems,” concludes the report.Follow me on Twitter:@securityaffairsandFacebookandMastodonPierluigi Paganini(SecurityAffairs–hacking, malware)facebooklinkedintwitterHackinghacking newsinformation security newsIT Information SecuritymalwarePierluigi PaganiniPUMAKITrootkitSecurity AffairsSecurity Newsyou might also likePierluigi PaganiniDecember 21, 2024Romanian national was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in NetWalker ransomware attacksRead morePierluigi PaganiniDecember 20, 2024Sophos fixed critical vulnerabilities in its Firewall productRead moreleave a commentnewsletterSubscribe to my email list and stayup-to-date!recent articlesRomanian national was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in NetWalker ransomware attacksCyber Crime/December 21, 2024Sophos fixed critical vulnerabilities in its Firewall productSecurity/December 20, 2024U.S. CISA adds BeyondTrust software flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalogSecurity/December 20, 2024Raccoon Infostealer operator sentenced to 60 months in prisonCyber Crime/December 20, 2024Mirai botnet targets SSR devices, Juniper Networks warnsMalware/December 19, 2024To contact me write an email to:Pierluigi Paganini :[email protected]LEARN MOREQUICK LINKSHomeCyber CrimeCyber warfareAPTData BreachDeep WebDigital IDHackingHacktivismIntelligenceInternet of ThingsLaws and regulationsMalwareMobileReportsSecuritySocial NetworksTerrorismICS-SCADAPOLICIESContact meCopyright@securityaffairs 2024We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

mechanismspierluigi paganinidecember  researchers discovered pumakit a linux rootkit capable of hiding files escalating privileges and evading system tools and detectionelastic security lab researchers discovered a new loadable kernel module lkm rootkit called pumakit that supports advanced evasion mechanismspumakit features a multistage design including a dropper memoryresident executables and a rootkit it leverages an lkm rootkit named puma using ftrace hooks to modify core system functionsthe malware hooks  syscalls and several kernel functions usingftraceto hide files directories and the rootkit itself while evading debugging attemptsdevelopers focused on stealthy deployment the malware activates only under specific conditions such as secure boot checks or kernel symbol availability embedding elf binaries within its dropperpumakit is a sophisticated piece of malware initially uncovered during routine threat hunting on virustotal and named after developerembedded strings found within its binary reads thereportpublished by elastic security lab key functionalities of the kernel module include privilege escalation hiding files and directories concealing itself from system tools antidebugging measures and establishing communication with commandandcontrol c serversthe lkm rootkit uses the syscall table to manipulate system behavior and relies on kallsyms_lookup_name for symbol resolution unlike rootkits that target kernel versions  and above the rootkit component of pumakit does not usekprobes suggesting it is designed for older kernelsthis choice is significant because prior to kernel version kallsyms_lookup_namewas exported and could be easily leveraged by modules even those without proper licensing continues the reportin february  kernel developers debated the unexporting ofkallsyms_lookup_nameto prevent misuse by unauthorized or malicious modules a common tactic involved adding a fakemodule_licensegpldeclaration to circumvent licensing checks allowing these modules to access nonexported kernel functions the lkm rootkit demonstrates this behaviorthermdir_hookfunction in pumakits kernel module interceptsrmdirsyscalls to manipulate directory operations the malware uses it for privilege escalation and to retrieve configuration details based on a structured input pattern the hook processes commands and arguments embedded in the syscall starting with zarya followed by command and argument characters this structured system enhances control and concealmentbelow is the list of commands

Give it a try.Click here to return to FASTTap here to return to FASTFASTTOKYO:Japan's space agency has halted an engine combustion test of its Epsilon S rocket, a spokesperson said on Tuesday (Nov 26), after a fire broke out at the test site, the Tanegashima Space Center in southwestern Japan.Footage from public broadcaster NHK showed a blaze breaking out shortly after the ground combustion test started, with an explosion heard as well.No damage has been reported, NHK said citing local police and fire departments.The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is checking the situation at the site, the spokesperson said.NHK said the fire happened during a combustion test that began at around 8.30am, with media stationed around 600m away.About 30 seconds later, a large explosion was heard, and what appeared to be something on fire flew towards the sea, it reported.The Sankei Shimbun reported that orange flames burst out from the rocket engine placed on a horizontal platform before the explosion.There were no reports of any injuries in the incident in the remote Kagoshima region of southern Japan.JAXA has partnered with the aerospace unit of IHI Corp to develop Epsilon S, a next-generation model of the nation's solid-fuel small rocket series Epsilon.Shares in IHI were down as much as 6 per cent in Tuesday's Tokyo trading.A previous engine test failure of the Epsilon S rocket in July 2023, together with a launch failure of the sixth Epsilon rocket in 2022, led to months of investigation that caused delays in Japan's national space missions and satellite launch plans.Epsilon S was slated for a debut flight by the end of the current fiscal year ending in March if Tuesday's engine test was successful.JAXA's larger flagship rocket H3, built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, also failed at its first launch last year but has since succeeded in three flights this year, launching Japanese satellites and winning orders from including French satellite company Eutelsat.H3 and Epsilon S have been JAXA's hope to build cost-competitive rockets on its own amid the rise of American commercial launch providers such as market leader SpaceX and small rocket maker Rocket Lab.Source: Agencies/rlSign up for our newslettersGet our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inboxSubscribe hereGet the CNA appStay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best storiesDownload hereGet WhatsApp alertsJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat appJoin hereRelated TopicsJapanrocketAdvertisementAlso worth readingContent is loading...AdvertisementExpand to read the full storyGet bite-sized news via a newcards interface.
