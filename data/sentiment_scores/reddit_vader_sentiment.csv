RocketLab_posts.csv,Moat chat,"First off this ain't a DD. This is a motivational wake up to what is actually happening. 


Every month that rocketlab is running, is the moat.


This ain't a 7/11 franchise. This is a business that has all the knowledge and engineering to get to space. Every day, every week, every month something new is learned that gives them an edged. All the layers beyond just a rocket, rocketlab already is refining and gaining new plans and partnerships.


All their previous launches, all that experience, gaining customers, a proven track record, refining, adapting, tweaking, integrating. Rocketlab building parts, building platforms, launching, monitoring, landing, building a process, refining a process.


The amount of experience, retaining customers, providing new experiences and solutions for customers...


...that is the moat. Doing the hard thing, doing it well, and most importantly already doing it. There isn't hopium, there isn't promises, they are already doing it.


Others haven't even scratched the surface of what that all entails. They don't have all the additional staff, processes, customers, solutions, platforms, they are stuck on figuring out step one. They are blowing millions, billions, without even a foundation of a business yet.


Rocketlab is so far ahead that they have a wild tech/intelligence/platform moat that is still far unrealized compared to their stock worth.


I am actually incredibly excited because a lot of this is still to be discovered by others. You really need to grasp how much rocketlab has already accomplished and how fast they are moving on neutron and space systems. Like, this ain't a shop that sells loaves of bread(nothing against a good sour dough, promise). They made a business that escapes the atmosphere, literally leaving the planet to find new opportunities. That is something once only held by the wealthiest and most knowledgable countries. Now we have it from rocketlab, where we individually have the ability, through its stock, to be a part of it. Literally nerd heaven.


Owning some rocketlab stock puts us right there in time, in the history of humanity where we are transitioning to space. Like imagine what you can tell your kids, nephews and neices or grand kids.


The wonderful thing is, you don't even have to imagine, you just do it, and you are a part of all this. Own a piece of this awesomeness. Help make sure it all happens, promote it, champion it. 


I just don't even know what else to say!!! It's so damn exciting.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Let's just imagine... what happens to Rocket Lab post-contact from Aliens?,"I know it is a taboo subject with a million different theories or beliefs. With all the congress hearings lately claiming UAPs are real, they are here, they hypothesize how they work within our understanding of physics but all agree the technology is not ours.

Let's just play pretend and all of that is 100% real and all of a sudden some alien race made contact and we got access to their gravitational propulsion technology, and are able to travel between our atmosphere, space, other planets, etc all very fast.

Does Rocket Lab just immediately become obsolete and tank? I suppose even if we don't need launch vehicles like rockets, the satellite components business would still be in full operation and working.

Or maybe it is a massive catalyst in humanity's drive for space and motivation to become interplanetary. All of a sudden rocket launches and satellites are #1, 2 and 3 priority and get massive attention and funding.

I thought this would be a fun thought experiment and conversation if we all think outside the box and think open minded!

I have a lingering thought. For Neutron reusability, where is the hop test vehicle? And if it is partially built, why has Rocket Lab not shared it's progress? Electron's 1st stage ability to come back to an area above the ocean via parachutes, to then be caught by a helicopter, was an interesting idea that never materialized. Bringing Neutron back to the Wallops pad, at a precise location, is much more challenging. And doing that landing on a floating barge is much more difficult. Why no word on the barge build?

Edit: With weapons I am specifically referring to bombs or other devices designed to activly hurt or kill people. I am not talking about missiles in general. Also I don't care about it if the rockets accidently crash and hurt the environment. The earth will certainly carry on without us. However I think its immoral to take away life, as in killing humans. Therefor (and thats just personal, not judging investors) I don't want to invest in stocks that build weapons (specifically bombs or WoMD designed to kill humans). Excluding explosives that are not used to harm humans (nuking an asteroid flying towards earth or exploding a mountain to mine diamonds). I just don't want my invested money used to actively hurt other people. However I don't care about espionage, cars and engines that hurts the environment or climate change or something like that.

RocketLab_posts.csv,I hope what I'm thinking doesn't happen,"I have a theory about why Blue Origin might finally cancel the launch of the Rocket Lab probes.

It was recently revealed that Blue Origin had applied for a license from the FAA to ship the Blue Moon MK1 in March 2025. (https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueOrigin/comments/1eqf17f/blue\_moon\_mk1\_pathfinder\_net\_march\_2025/)

A few days ago Bloomberg revealed that the hardware of the second and third New Glenn ship had been damaged in internal company tests, if the report is accurate, BO only has a single New Glenn ship tested and ready to fly, with the urgency of BO to demonstrate their lunar rover for missions to NASA while Starship is in development, they may have their internal interests as priority. (https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/08/21/bezos-blue-origin-suffers-fiery-setback-building-new-rocket/)

Let us remember that the probes that Rocket Lab has manufactured are launch class D, low-cost and these can be delayed, since they are not an urgent priority like classes A and B would be.

These are my thoughts, maybe I'm wrong and everything is ready for launch, but if Blue Origin decides in the end that they will not be able to meet the schedule for the window, it is possible that they are considering this path of prioritizing their lunar module since they are very profitable missions that NASA spends a lot of money

Ahead of earnings I've been doing some research. I'm fairly ok with this quarter earnings meeting the targets of 98m assuming the space system forecast was accurate. Traditionally they've been pretty close so maybe +/- 1m but overall they've had all successful launches done.

My issue is for the upcoming quarter. Didn't they guide for like 6 launches this quarter? And more so for the entire year it was around 22/24. I really don't think this seems feasible right now. 

A possible downwards revision in launches in the guidance could be bearish news for this stock right? We could take a big hit that basis?

A delay/downwards revision in launches is either due to the fault of customers not having satellites ready to go or just a big lag between when Rocket lab get the electron rockets ready for launch.

The other side is the good news which could be them saying they'd be able to hit the target launches and possible news of neutron.",8,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1chca1w/downward_revision_for_q2_launches/,0.6149,0.087,0.848,0.065

But there is also a group of startups that are not interested in building rockets, because they are clear that they cannot compete with the main 3, so they are dedicating their efforts to trying to offer other services related to payload, saleslites, software, among others. . services that may arise, but we will not talk about them, we will focus on SpaceX, Blue Origin and Rocket Lab, which is what is expected of them in the coming years and this is where I want to make it clear that it is my perception that I will say to below and this may not happen as I will say.

To begin with, I think that SpaceX and Blue Origin have some points in common, not only does it have a strong backing of money, but its CEOs are people with certain power, who may have certain ties with politicians, this in some way . may influence certain future government contracts.

As for Rocket Lab, it is a company that comes from nowhere and is making its way with its own resources, this is where I want to remain skeptical, I don't know if Rocket is aware that it can be very difficult to compete directly with these 2 companies in the future, maybe I'm wrong, but I have the feeling that Rocket Lab will eventually focus on offering services like the other startups they mention at the beginning want to do and will slowly abandon rockets.

In terms of durability, will carbon fiber still allow neutron to be reused a high number of times? I‚Äôm especially curious about reusability because of Rocket Lab‚Äôs goal of eventually having the capability to relaunch within 24 hours. 

Is it also possible Rocket Lab is becoming increasingly better equipped to manufacture carbon fiber materials, and they‚Äôre capitalizing on this more than SpaceX?",30,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1b8721b/neutrons_use_of_carbon_fiber/,0.9324,0.139,0.861,0.0
RocketLab_posts.csv,Estimating Neutron first launch date based on publicly announced milestones,"Reposting with some updates to assumptions, from a different account for privacy reasons. Calculations haven't changed, and reference data is shown in the table at the bottom.

A little out of interest and mostly out of boredom, I decided to collate some public statements around Neutron development milestones to estimate the delay to Neutron's first launch date. For this, I collected statements from:

* Presentations available on Rocket Lab's investor relations page
* Archived versions of the Neutron page on the Rocket Lab website

This work could be expanded significantly by trawling through videos, interviews, etc as well (but not by me, this was already only mildly less boring than what I was avoiding doing). It is only a very simple analysis, with some large assumptions being made. Of course, these are only adjustments to public timelines and contain no inside knowledge of Rocket Lab's schedules or internal estimates.

Here's a chart of the results up front:

[Chart of Neutron first launch date estimates. The x-axis is the date that the statement of a milestone was made \(either Archimedes first hot fire or LC-3 readiness\).](https://preview.redd.it/gx0p4rpf4mmc1.png?width=3126&format=png&auto=webp&s=f13b2973239623152232b2c6b00da92ff294b353)

There are two different estimates based on two different approaches for each public statement date:

1. Simple Delay - assumes the amount of work after the milestone date remains the same as the original schedule, and adds the delay to the original launch date of 31 Dec 2024. This means that if Archimedes first hot fire is delayed by one year, the first launch date is delayed by one year.
2. Proportional Delay - this assumes that the effort estimates for the whole schedule are off by some factor, and applies that factor to the remaining activities as well. I.e., if it takes twice as long to reach Archimedes first hot fire from project start, it will also take twice as long to reach first launch from project start.

There are obviously a fair few assumptions going into this very basic analysis:

* Archimedes and LC-3 readiness are on the critical path to first launch. This means any delay to either of these is a delay to first launch. None of the calculated dates above assume a delay in both, only one or the other (and all but one is based on a delay in Archimedes).
* It does not account for any ""accelerations"" such as the company throwing significantly more people or money at the program, purchasing more components rather than building in house, etc. It also assumes that any planned ramp up in personnel is included in the original timeline and any other timelines shared publicly by the company.
* It assumes publicly announced dates were the best dates known to the company at the time, and takes them at face value on this.
* These two models for estimating delay are valid.
* When milestones were only listed as being completed in ""Q3"", the latest date in that quarter or month was assumed.
* When milestones were listed on the timeline on the Neutron page (only sorted by year, but in order), best guess was applied for delivery date to try and be most reasonable.
* It includes all delays - including from changing Archimedes architecture and having to redo a bunch of work there.

**What does this tell us?**

Neutron is probably delayed based on the assumptions made here, without a significant change in approach or spend - this analysis estimates to 2026 in all likelihood. This isn't a validated approach to estimating first launch of a new rocket, so you could dismiss it entirely if you want.

I personally think the first launch will be somewhere in between the Simple Delay and Proportional Delay (a bit closer to the Simple Delay) as the company will be trying to accelerate as much as they can to recover the timeline, and the Proportional Delay estimates are therefore extremely conservative. But at this scale, it only takes a few simple mistakes to significantly delay a program, so who knows.

**If you wanted to take this further**

I would recommend two next steps:

1. Add in more information sources (interviews, podcasts, videos, info from Electron launch livestreams, etc)
2. Perform the same analysis for other companies' first rockets that have actually launched to roughly assess the validity or accuracy of the method

Tl;dr - just look at the pretty graph

Has anyone else been getting emails from ""Rocket Lab"" saying they have positions open and would like to conduct an interview with me. It seems fine at first but the more I look at the paperwork and such I am pretty sure it is a scam that someone is doing. So if someone see's it be careful I doubt that it is the real company. I can attach a screengrab of the email I have got a few times now. Then once you answer the email like an automated one sends again saying to contact them through teams and to continue with the interview through there. I am pretty positive this is a scam but I haven't talked with them other than sending the first email.

RocketLab_posts.csv,"LC-1A vs LC1-B, choice of launch pad in New Zealand","RocketLab's first 23 Electron launches were from LC-1A in New Zealand.

In 2022 they finished construction of a new pad, LC-1B, near the original and intended to increase launch frequency. 

The next 15 New Zealand launches in a row were from LC-1B. (And some from a third launchpad in America). 

Why is there such a strong preference for LC-1B? Is it better than LC-1A in some way? Is LC-1A undergoing upgrades currently? LC-1B was built five years later so might be a better pad and they've gone back to make the same changes to LC-1A?    
Or is the plan to ignore LC-1A and stick to LC-1B, improve launch frequency with a better pad rather than improving frequency by using two pads? I did wonder if they were modifying the pad ready for Neutron but that's a much larger rocket so they'd probably need to build a whole new pad rather than upgrading the oldest one.

So what's happening with LC-1A? Is LC-1B just better?",17,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1axcf1c/lc1a_vs_lc1b_choice_of_launch_pad_in_new_zealand/,0.9325,0.118,0.873,0.01

RocketLab_posts.csv,Is Rocket Lab moving away from Matlab and towards Python in all jobs?,"Hi guys,

&#x200B;

I am thinking of going to uni this year and doing some ad-hoc courses in Python and data analysis to better prepare myself for some mechanical engineering roles in Rocket Lab. On many job listings, Python seems to be the sole requirement as far as data analysis goes.

&#x200B;

Does this indicate that Rocket Lab no longer is favouring Matlab and that I don't have to worry about taking Matlab courses to prepare myself better for some roles, such as in propulsion or thermofluids? Getting into one of these would be a dream!

Thanks in advance for all answers!

RocketLab_posts.csv,Sources indicate that the customer is likely the Space Development Agency.," 

SDA, an organization under the U.S. Space Force, is building a mesh[ network of military satellites](https://spacenews.com/space-development-agency-renames-constellation-to-reflect-focus-on-u-s-warfighter/?preview_id=140632&preview_nonce=0118ef1bb4&preview=true&_thumbnail_id=141872) in low Earth orbit known as the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.

SDA Director Derek Tournear speaking at a conference earlier this month said the agency was negotiating a contract with an unspecified supplier for 18 satellites to expand the U.S. military low Earth orbit constellation.

One of the portions of SDA‚Äôs proliferated architecture is the [Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta](https://spacenews.com/space-development-agencys-data-transport-satellites-get-more-complex/), made up of communications satellites to enable beyond line-of-sight connectivity for military forces on the ground.¬†

Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta is projected to have 90 satellites. The agency in August announced it awarded $1.5 billion in contracts to Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman for 72 Beta satellites.

Tournear said Dec. 7 at a National Security Space Association event that SDA was planning to add another 18 Beta satellites to the constellation and was in negotiations with another vendor that he did not disclose.

The Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta satellites ‚Äî projected to launch in 2026 and 2027 ‚Äî will carry radios using the UHF (Ultra High Frequency) and S-band frequencies that military and intelligence units rely upon for voice and low-speed data transmissions.

‚ÄúWe are looking at putting another approximately 18 satellites on contract, and we‚Äôre working with a third vendor to do that, and we should make that announcement shortly,‚Äù Tournear said Dec. 7 at the NSSA forum.¬†

According to Rocket Lab‚Äôs SEC filing, the contract includes a base amount of $489 million, with incentives and options worth $26 million. ‚ÄúWork under the agreement will begin immediately with the delivery of the space vehicles to the customer for launch slated for 2027, operation of the satellites through 2030, and an option to operate the satellites through 2033.‚Äù

RocketLab_posts.csv,Why is RocketLab the only launch provider with a Photon equivalent?,"Photon is a really cool addition to RocketLab's Electron rocket.

It blurs the lines between being a part of the payload and part of the launch vehicle, in a way it's both at once. From the customer's perspective it must be really useful to have Photon as an option when launching your payload. It can provide extra thrust to reach higher orbits than Electron alone, or it can provide the orbit circularisation burn at apogee, in both cases removing the need for the payload to handle those burns and keeping the final payload mass low. But it's also a communications bus to talk to Earth, has precision guidance systems and star tracking to assist in those final burns, further reducing payload complexity.

I was looking up Photon to make this post and I discovered they've made it even better than I already thought it was. The CAPSTONE mission to the moon last year used an upgraded Photon with an upgraded engine. They're marketing it as a full satellite bus with solar panels and radio antennae for missions to Mars or Venus. I thought it was just the kick-stage for the last little nudge to the correct orbit, I didn't realise it was so capable.

Which feeds more into my question, why doesn't anyone else have a Photon equivalent?

RocketLab's website describes Photon as being ""Vertically integrated with in-house subsystems based on constellation-scale manufacturing capabilities"". Yeah, it's made by people who routinely make and launch rockets, uses known parts and subsystems with known behaviours and capabilities. It just makes sense that the rocket manufacturer can make a really effective satellite bus, especially for customers where this might be their first satellite. I wonder if the customer base of smallsat providers / first launches is why this is relevant for RocketLab but not SpaceX. In theory SpaceX make a bigger and better kickstage/satellite-bus with Draco/Superdraco engines and help people launch more capable satellites. But Falcon 9 is so much bigger that their customers are usually larger and more capable of managing their own payloads. Electron is so much smaller and more of their customers are smallsats / first ever launches and they need to lean more heavily on the launch provider.

It may also be that Falcon 9's second stage has excess capacity compared to Electron's second stage. Apart from Starlink launches very few Falcon 9 launches come within 20% of the max payload capacity so they just use the second stage for circularisation burns or finessing the orbital insertion. Electron can't do that because it's so close to the mass limits and it's more efficient to ditch the second stage mass and use a smaller kickstage for circularisation burns.

But I'm just guessing blind really. I'd like to see SpaceX develop a Photon equivalent for Falcon 9. Or someone else, maybe Stoke or Relativity Space or ISRO.",36,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/176zsgg/why_is_rocketlab_the_only_launch_provider_with_a/,0.9909,0.09,0.897,0.013

**Reused Rutherford Engine Successfully Flies on 40th Mission!** 

You   read that right! On August 24 (NZST), we successfully launched our  40th  Electron mission, called ‚ÄúWe Love the Nightlife,‚Äù for Capella  Space.  Not only did we deliver Capella‚Äôs satellite to orbit, but we  also  demonstrated some significant milestones in evolving Electron into  a  reusable rocket.¬†

For  the  first time, we reused a Rutherford engine that had previously flown  on  our ‚ÄúThere And Back Again‚Äù mission in May 2022. The engine worked   flawlessly on its second flight as it took Electron to space. Then the   first stage returned to Earth with a successful ocean splashdown in the   Pacific Ocean.¬†

Hot on the heels  of ‚ÄúWe Love the Nightlife,‚Äù we‚Äôre launching another  dedicated Electron  launch for Capella. The ‚ÄòWe Will Never Desert You‚Äô  mission is scheduled  for lift-off from Launch Complex 1 as soon as 19  September. The  mission will be our third launch for Capella this year ‚Äì  we're on a  roll! ¬†

* [Four new HASTE missions](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=dd817b0cc7&e=56a66a2a9a) for Leidos under the MACH-TB program, scheduled to launch from LC-2 across 2024 and 2025. ¬†
* BlackSky,   a leading provider of real-time geospatial intelligence and global   monitoring services, which has launched on six Electron missions since   2019, [signed a block buy deal for five Electron launches](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=85cc888a2e&e=56a66a2a9a)   for their Gen-3 satellites beginning in 2024. Fun fact: BlackSky has   used Electron as a launch vehicle more than any other single commercial   customer!¬†¬†
* A new, double-launch deal with NASA to deliver their climate change research-focused mission, [PREFIRE](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=45378f0d66&e=56a66a2a9a),   is now scheduled to launch in May 2024. NASA's PREFIRE (Polar Radiant   Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment) mission will help close a gap in   understanding of how much of Earth‚Äôs heat is lost to space, especially   from the Arctic and Antarctica. This will be our 7th and 8th mission  for  NASA since 2018. (Graphic we made of 2 launches)¬†¬†
* Last but not least, [we signed a deal with Japanese Earth imaging company Synspective ](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=8e1595f672&e=56a66a2a9a)to   launch two dedicated Electron missions. Rocket Lab has been launching   for Synspective since 2020 when the Company deployed the first  satellite  in Synspective‚Äôs synthetic aperture radar (SAR)  constellation. Since  that first mission, Rocket Lab has been the sole  launch provider for  Synspective‚Äôs StriX constellation to date,  successfully deploying three  StriX satellites across three dedicated  Electron launches¬†

Rocket Lab Wins Industry of the Year Award for Stennis Location

Rocket Lab received the prestigious [Industry of the Year Award](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=42323fcd30&e=56a66a2a9a)   at the Hancock Chamber Business & Industry Awards Gala in August.   The annual awards recognize outstanding achievements in citizenship,   industry and business in Hancock County, Mississippi. ¬†  
We opened our  facility at the Stennis Space Center in 2022 and the site  will be used  to test the new Archimedes engines for the Neutron rocket  coming in  2024.¬†

When   we expanded our Space Systems division, we created a vertical   integration strategy where we could build essential elements of a   spacecraft for our own satellites and those built by others. The idea   behind this was everything going to space should have a Rocket Lab logo   on it!¬†

Speaking of‚Ä¶¬†                                      **NASA Psyche Mission** 

NASA‚Äôs  Psyche mission, which will orbit a metal-rich asteroid of the  same  name in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, is  scheduled  to launch in less than 30 days on 5 October 2023! ¬†

The spacecraft will use a huge Rocket Lab solar array that will power the spacecraft during its 4-billion-kilometer journey.¬†

MethaneSAT,  scheduled to launch no earlier than January 2024, is an  Earth  observation satellite that will monitor and study global methane   emissions to combat climate change. We are providing multiple elements   to make this mission a success including developing the Mission   Operation Center, the solar panels to power the spacecraft, and the   separation system that will eject the satellite to its orbit. This   mission is jointly funded and operated by the Environmental Defense   Fund, an American NGO, and the New Zealand Space Agency ‚Äì the country‚Äôs   first space science mission! ¬†

**Neutron Update**

Neutron,   our mega constellation launcher, continues its development on  schedule.  We‚Äôve now begun Stage 2 tank testing including cryogenic fill  and  pressure cycles to determine structural and sealing integrity and   performance, hydrostat test to prove the structural integrity of the   structure, domes, and hatches, and the fill, press, vent and de-tank   systems and procedures among other structural tests.

Our engineers are hard at work making Neutron a reality!

RocketLab_posts.csv,Thoughts on Ashlee Vance's new book?,"I just finished When the Heavens Went on Sale, Ashlee Vance's new book detailing Planet Labs, Rocket Lab, Astra, and Firefly. I read Vance's book on Musk when it came out and learned a lot from it. This new book had some really great history and details, and gives us a very inside view of the founding of these exciting companies. However, I must say it was relatively unbalanced. The section on Rocket Lab was short and sweet, and tried to include some negatives/controversies where there weren't really any. The other sections were rife with massive issues with the founders, conflicts, etc. I was honestly looking to learn about companies besides Rocket Lab so I could diversify my position in the space economy, but after reading I just want to hold RKLB more because the others have so many issues. The sections on Astra and Firefly seemed so hopeful, but blatantly ignored the reality that Rocket Lab has worked up a regular cadence with a flight proven vehicle while they are still floundering around.

I did learn some new stuff about Rocket Lab, like how the first electron launch when flawlessly and it was actually a US government software issue that caused them to terminate. What a shame. However, the section on Astra seemed really drawn out when it was effectively chapter after chapter of ""they tried to launch a rocket, it was delayed/blew up"" and especially knowing that they never got Rocket 3 to work and won't launch another rocket until 2025, when they're out of cash.

I think the main takeaway for me was how the US government has really muddled the space industry by overreaching. E.g. everyone at NASA having 0 vision besides Pete Worden, multiple agencies cockblocking Max Polyakov for being Ukrainian, and the restrictions on Rocket Lab's development given that most of it happens in New Zealand. 

I wanted to see what you all thought of the book, if you had different impressions, and just get a conversation going around it. While the book should get some more people looking at Rocket Lab, I think it really underplays their accomplishments while trying to inflate the progress of the competition.",19,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1526awp/thoughts_on_ashlee_vances_new_book/,0.9748,0.095,0.882,0.024

# Introduction

With the 2024 first launch of the Rocket Lab Mega Constellation Launcher‚ÄîThe Neutron‚Äîfast approaching, I decided it is high time for a more up-to-date DD on Rocket Lab. A lot is happening in the industry, the company, and the world. I have decided to dive into the future, fundamentals, industry, funding, financials, dreams, and of course, the memes of the aspiring space company. Now, I am posting my DD into both of the Rocket Lab subreddit, as I am new to writing DD and I want to hit as wide of an audience as I can. One disclaimer (for those who do not like stock talk), this DD is not meant to encourage buying of the stock, nor is it financial advice or a stock-only DD, I merely want to dive into this company and simply spark some discussion on it!

Now, Rocket Lab is a private aerospace manufacturer and small satellite launch service provider. The company was founded in 2006 by Peter Beck and is headquartered in Long Beach, California, with additional facilities in New Zealand and Australia. Rocket Lab specializes in the development and launch of small rockets capable of delivering payloads of up to 300 kilograms to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab‚Äîself-designated as a leader in launch and space systems‚Äîis a company that has a chance at becoming a highly profitable giant over the next decade and beyond. In my honest opinion, Rocket Lab currently thrives off of the crumbs of the current space industry ecosystem. With Space X increasingly focused upon one goal‚Äîthanks to their controversial, yet nevertheless, fearless leader‚Äîbeing Mars, Rocket Labs can (and in my opinion will) become one of the go-to space companies for low earth orbit launches in the near term and in the long-term become one of the go-to space company for launches between the Moon, Venus, and Mars as well. Rocket Lab currently lives off of the crumbs left behind by NASA, Space X, and the United States military-industrial complex.

[  Like these two legends from the movie War Dogs, Rocket Lab is determined to become the go-to space company for transporting all types of goods into orbit. For those of you who have not seen the movie \(I personally highly recommend it\), essentially, when these two start their arms-dealing company, they focus upon all of the small contracts that the government is putting out for arms supplies. The contracts that the big players are ignoring, due to their small sizes, even so, these small contracts are worth hundreds of thousands to low millions. Now, this is where Rocket Lab currently lies in the industry.](https://preview.redd.it/j6wloa05vd4b1.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fc5120309359cb8789b861e68009133ef92d376)

[ \\""A new space race has begun, and most Americans are not even aware of it. This race is not \[about\] political prestige or military power. This new race involves the whole human species in a contest against time.\\"" - Ben Bova ](https://preview.redd.it/iliovpg7vd4b1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=f22e8c01f45a403829c6c681966f1a9a53fab213)

Now, before I dive into everything here, I need every to understand that this industry is on the verge of immense change and rapid evolution. We are currently in the first stage of the world‚Äôs Second Space Race. As a student of History, I can confidently tell you that there are murmurings within the historical community, that this is the case, beginning with the creation and success of Space X‚Äôs first reusable rocket: the Falcon 9. On December 21st of 2015, when the first Falcon 9 was launched and the landing was successful with the first stage fully recovered, the race began. In the same way that there is no single company above all others in the airline, shipping & transportation, or car manufacturing industries, is the same reason I do not believe that Space X will alone run the space industry‚Äôs transportation needs. There is plenty of room for companies like Rocket Lab to fill the gaps Space X cannot and in a decade‚Äôs time, there will be plenty of room for even more companies. Yet, there are no companies that are even close to competing with Space X‚Äîother than Rocket Lab‚Äîat this time. Now, I won‚Äôt go deeply into most of these competitors in this deep dive, but to be short, Astra is on the verge of total failure, Virgin Galactic has been playing an entirely different game‚Äîspace tourism, which there is a massive market for, just perhaps won‚Äôt be penetrated by them‚Äîthey likewise seem to be failing. While Blue Origin has been playing a strong game and Space X an even stronger one, albeit more and more focused solely on Mars as the years go on.

[ Here you can see the 1-year charts of Rocket Lab, Astra, Virgin, and Boeing for reference, as you can see, these charts speak volumes. Rocket Lab has been having a tough year but has found a nice bottom and is consistently bouncing from lows in the $3.6-4 range. While Astra has been reduced to a penny stock, with their future unknown. Virgin Galactic is only maintaining below Rocket Lab‚Äôs share price, partly due to the large number of Retail investors that do not know much and refuse to let it die, coupled with a small hope that the company can recover in the coming years. Boeing is here for reference as to what a successful, large-cap company involved in a similar industry \(and the space industry as well\), should look like over the course of a decent year. ](https://preview.redd.it/4lgxhawavd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d24878b2d7dc72b1e5c87ccd01d67c077485001a)

*Now, there are a few assumptions that I am making that we need to cover before diving into the real DD:* Whether it be because we live in the beginnings of a second Space Race (fueled by privatized space companies and the world‚Äôs governments) or because of technological advancement and a rising interest in space, the increase in rocket launches, space development (in Earth‚Äôs orbit, the Moon, and Mars), and the lowering costs of space launches‚Ä¶ it will become exponentially cheaper, easier, and faster to launch into orbit and the industry as a whole will have a massive boom‚Äîakin, in a way, to the industrial revolution‚Äîover the mid-to-late 2020s into the early 2030s. With the mid-to-end 2030s and early 2040s, we will see massive developments in terms of low-Earth orbit manufacturing facilities, tourist destinations, and stations, as well as settlements on the Moon for mining and refueling for greater exploration and colonization of the Sol System as a whole.

Now these are in part assumptions, but I think once one does the research and looks at the fact, all of this is very achievable. Even if it does not occur in this way, you can shift the dates by an additional decade and every time you do, the more likely, easier, and cheaper it all becomes.

Rocket Lab's business model revolves around providing cost-effective and frequent access to space for small satellite operators. The company aims to simplify the process of deploying satellites by offering dedicated launches on its Electron rocket. Rocket Lab operates as an end-to-end service provider, handling the entire launch process from mission planning and payload integration to launch and on-orbit operations.

# Section 1: Rocket Lab Takes Flight! The Electron & the Neutron

[  ‚ÄòRocket Lab is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, complete spacecraft design and manufacturing, satellite components, flight software, and an on-orbit management.‚Äô ‚Äì Rocket Labs](https://preview.redd.it/nbt3cd8dvd4b1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc518b0149113dc115f082394c2b6e8b33e36707)

Rocket Lab's primary launch vehicle, the Electron, is a two-stage rocket powered by Rutherford engines, which use electric-pump-fed LOX/RP-1 propellants. The Electron is designed to optimize cost, flexibility, and rapid launch capability for small satellites. Rocket Lab has demonstrated numerous successful launches since its inaugural flight in 2017, showcasing its technological prowess and reliability. The small satellite market has been growing rapidly, driven by increased demand for data collection, communications, and Earth observation. Rocket Lab's focus on dedicated launches for small satellites positions it well to capture a significant portion of this expanding market. The company has already established a solid customer base, securing contracts with government agencies, research institutions, and commercial entities.

Rocket Labs‚Äîat the time of writing this‚Äîhas had 37 launches‚Äîwith a 91.89% success rate‚Äîdeployed 164 satellites, operates 3 launch pads, and is maintaining 3 Photon Satellites in the Earth‚Äôs orbit. Of the 164 satellites launched by Rocket Labs, they were commissioned to do so by a wide variety of clients, from NASA, Space Force, DARPA, to Canon. Rocket Labs is supported by Future Fund: Australia‚Äôs Sovereign Wealth Fund, Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Data Collective, Greenspring Associates, ACC, Promus Ventures, L One W One Ltd., and Lockheed Martin.

Rocket Lab‚Äôs main rocket, the Electron‚Äîbuilt and operated by Rocket Lab‚Äîhas flown 37 times and been successful 34 times, with only 3 failures. Rocket Lab‚Äôs key areas of business penetration lie in the launch of mid-sized service rockets, the manufacturing of space systems and satellites, and their adept ability to manufacture industrial space parts, applications, and proponents. The latter of which, they are sort of unopposed in terms of competition.

The Neutron‚ÄîRocket Lab‚Äôs medium-lift, mega constellation launcher‚Äîwill be able to launch 13,000 kilograms into low Earth orbit and it will be ‚Ä¶drum roll please‚Ä¶ reusable! The current goal is for it to launch in 2024. It will be designed for not only low earth orbital supply missions, but also deep space missions, and even human spaceflight. It will be fairing a design allowing for full reusability of the first stage and it will be lightweight, being made of Rock Lab‚Äôs own carbon composite structure. The home base for the Neutron will be at the Neutron Production Complex and the launch pad at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility and Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.

[ ‚ÄòThe Neutron Production Complex will be home to a rocket production, assembly, and integration facility, as well as a dedicated launch pad for the Neutron rocket located on the southern end of Wallops Island. The estimated 250,000 square foot state-of-the-art complex will be constructed on a 28-acre site adjacent to the Wallops Island Flight Facility and will include a Launch Control Center, Rocket Lab‚Äôs fifth global operations center for launch activities and on-orbit operations. To support rapid production of the Neutron rocket, current plans for the complex include automated fiber placement robotic production systems capable of laying up meters of Neutron‚Äôs new, specially formulated carbon composite structures in minutes. As a reusable rocket, Neutron is designed to land back on the Launch Complex 3 pad after a mission and from there it would be returned to the production complex for refurbishment and re-flight.‚Äô ](https://preview.redd.it/k592skwfvd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=279742c6d6196d860258d747af98f84e71b71470)

With Space X dominating large-load space orbital flight and transportation, Rocket Labs, in my honest opinion, is where Space X was roughly something like 6-8 years ago. While Rocket Lab intends to compete with Space X‚Äîwhether it will be considered competition in an industry this brand new and small, time will tell‚Äîfor cargo and humans to the low Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and even Venus! Space X and Elon Musk have made it abundantly clear that the goal of Space X is the large-scale settlement of Mars. While later models of Rocket Lab‚Äôs Neutron will be able to go to Mars and Venus, it appears that is not their main goal. In the near term (being the next two decades), they will be looking to dominate the low Earth orbit and Moon market as well as the manufacturing of industrial space parts, applications, and proponents.

# Section 2: The Space Industry & Company Fundamentals

Rocket Lab faces competition from other commercial launch providers, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. However, the company differentiates itself by specializing in small satellite launches, offering a tailored solution for this niche market. Rocket Lab's Electron rocket provides the advantage of dedicated launches and the flexibility to reach specific orbits, making it an attractive option for small satellite operators.

Rocket Lab has raised significant funding through various investment rounds, securing capital from venture capital firms, strategic partners, and government entities. Notable investors include Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Lockheed Martin. The company's ability to attract substantial investment indicates confidence in its business model and growth potential. Rocket Lab operates within the regulatory framework of the countries in which it launches its rockets. The company holds necessary licenses and approvals from government agencies, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Compliance with safety regulations and adherence to environmental guidelines are crucial aspects of Rocket Lab's operations.

Despite its achievements, Rocket Lab faces several risks and challenges. The space industry is highly competitive, and the success of the company depends on its ability to secure launch contracts and maintain a steady launch cadence. Regulatory changes, launch failures, or delays could impact Rocket Lab's operations and reputation. Additionally, the emergence of new technologies or market disruptors could pose a threat to the company's market position

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room, the Quarterly Results. To preface, negative quarterly results mean‚Äîpardon my French‚Äîjack-shit (at least in the short term) for a company such as Rocket Lab, that is looking at penetrating a market such as the space industry. We are going to look at the past four Quarterly Results in chronological order.

**Q2 2022 Report:** Rocket Lab achieved record revenue of $55.5 million, showing significant growth compared to the previous quarter (36% sequential growth) and the same quarter in the previous year (392% YoY growth). Despite the revenue growth, the company reported a negative EPS of $-0.08, indicating a net loss for the quarter.

**Q3 2022 Report:** Another record revenue was achieved, reaching $63.1 million, with a sequential growth of 14% and an impressive YoY growth of 1,093%. The company's EPS improved slightly to $-0.07 but still remained negative. The fourth quarter revenue is expected to be lower, ranging between $51 million and $54 million, as a launch customer's push extends into 2023.

**Q4 2022 Report:** The company's revenue for Q4 reached $51.8 million, showing a healthy year-over-year growth of 88%. The full-year revenue for fiscal 2022 amounted to $211 million, reflecting substantial growth of 239% compared to the previous year. The EPS remained negative at $-0.08.

**Q1 2023 Report:** The revenue for Q1 2023 was $54.9 million. Increasing revenue by 35% in the first quarter of 2023. Revenue from their launch business was $19.6 million, up $12 million from the prior quarter. Their EPS was $-0.08, indicating strong maintenance of their business. The second quarter is expected to show a significant revenue increase, with an estimated range of $60 million to $63 million.

Now, what does this all tell us? Firstly, they were very forthcoming with the quarterly expectations. Something one might think is not a big deal, but considering how a lot of publicly traded companies operate, this is a good thing. In each of their earnings reports, they have nearly exactly estimated their results, showing they are not attempting to mislead investors. The company has experienced impressive revenue growth throughout the reported quarters, indicating strong market performance and demand for its products/services. However, the negative EPS values suggest that the company is still operating at a net loss. From a shareholder‚Äôs perspective, the company's focus should be on achieving profitability and reducing the negative EPS, while maintaining consistent revenue growth. In my opinion, this stock is sitting just below a fair market value for what it is right now, sitting at just over $4, considering they are not fully profitable. Yet Rocket Lab continues to grow its business, making more contracts, and it stands a competitive chance. If they can turn a profit within 2-3 years, I think they will be one hell of a company. With their competitors failing left and right and none finding the success as Rocket Lab‚Äîother than Space X‚Äîthey could stand to be a massive company in a few decades, so massive, they‚Äôre bigger than Earth.

One last financial point to touch upon‚Ä¶ shorting, so here is some data, which is roughly one month outdated due to my difficulty in finding up-to-date information on the company without a Bloomberg Terminal (So, if anyone on the sub has access to a Bloomberg Terminal and would like to add to my DD in the comments, please do).

**Last Record Date:** May 15, 2023

**Outstanding Shares:** 478,660,000 shares

**Float Size:** 262,310,000 shares

**Short Percent of Float:** 9.80% (The short percent of float represents the percentage of shares available for trading that have been sold short).

**Average Trading Volume:** 4,044,396 shares

**Current Short Volume:** 25,710,000 shares

**Previous Short Volume:** 24,630,000 shares

**Change Vs. Previous Month**: +4.38%

**Dollar Volume Sold Short:** $111.58 million

**Short Interest Ratio / Days to Cover:** 7.7 (This ratio indicates the number of days it would take for the short sellers to cover their positions based on the average daily trading volume.).

The short interest in Rocket Lab has increased from the previous month, with a change of +4.38%. The short percent of the float is 9.80%, indicating that a significant portion of the available shares for trading has been sold short. Now, Rocket Lab‚Äôs short interest is relatively low for a company that has had consistent negative EPS and revenue. Showcasing that the big players in markets either A) believe this company will make a massive turnaround in the near future (1-3 years mark) or B) Rocket Lab, due to its size, is thankfully not on their radar. However, that said, the off-exchange short percentage is 57.69%, showcasing that A) public on-exchange short volume is a complete hoax and Hedge Funds, and other big players are beating down on the stock or B) all of this information is completely misrepresented to retail traders on purpose and the entirety of the United States market system is a complete farce.

# Section 3: Future Prospects & Big Moves

Rocket Lab has demonstrated strong performance and growth potential in the emerging small satellite launch market. The company continues to refine its launch processes, aiming to increase launch frequency and reduce costs further. Additionally, Rocket Lab has plans to develop a larger reusable rocket called Neutron, targeting the medium-lift market segment, which would expand its capabilities and market reach. The company has the potential to be the go-to company for low Earth orbital launches in the short term and in the long term, one of, if not the go-to company, for transportation to the Moon, Mars, and Venus.

[  Peter Beck, founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, did an interview last month on his take on the industry and their future prospects. I wanted to touch briefly on this \(you can find the video on YouTube\).](https://preview.redd.it/ced7t9iivd4b1.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=6579fcd100b405f44d1e65fb13cb185cefe6ed76)

Firstly, the video begins with the commentator stating, ""*With the Space Race this week*,"" the Space X rocket, the most powerful ever built, has scrubbed its launch. While Rocket Lab is adding a new service for testing hypersonic sub-orbital launches, being a welcome addition to the company‚Äôs wide array of services. Beck states that it is a very exciting time, stating that ‚Äú*the United States is kind of lacking behind in hypersonic technologies and this is a great opportunity to have high cadence, test flight environment for these payloads to really move forward the US‚Äôs hypersonic research*.‚Äù He goes on to talk about how these capabilities are essentially repurposed from Rocket Lab‚Äôs Electron Rocket capabilities: ‚Äú*We take a standard Electron orbital-class launch vehicle and we fly it in some really unique trajectories to provide these hypersonic trajectories‚Ä¶ it is taking an Electron and making a couple wee tweaks to it and having a great high frequency hypersonic testing platform that hasn‚Äôt existed*.‚Äù Beck goes on to speak on the launch cadence ‚Äú*being on target for 15 flights*‚Äù this year with the fastest turn around this year being 7 days between flights, saying ‚Äú*the machine is cranking and the vehicles are flying successfully and the last flight was a reusable vehicle and we splashed that down successfully and now we‚Äôre kind at the point where we are recycling and harvesting engines and components off of those launch vehicles and getting ready to put them back into service and re-fly them*.‚Äù He continues, stating, ‚Äú*I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm allowed to say exactly, but‚Ä¶ a whole multiple gambit of reused components that are all now re-entering the production line and going back into service*.‚Äù Morgan Brennan, the interviewer then speaks to how there is this emerging mismatch between supply and demand when it comes to the satellite launch market, with the fact that there are so many satellite constellations that are poised to go into orbit in the coming years and not enough capacity in terms of launching them. So, she then asks about the reusability of Electron and the development of the Neutron. Beck states that, ‚Äú*Electron is really serving that market very well, and there are lots of flight opportunities that are sort of just doing its thing, Neutron is the new flight opportunity for us‚Ä¶ 2026 to 2030 timeframe there is a massive deficit in launch and there are lots of constellations that are all really vying for an ability to get in orbit, so we saw that coming and started work on the vehicle and hopefully we can bring it into service in 2024 and really solve some of those problems and take advantage of that market opportunity*.‚Äù

Now, I don‚Äôt have to tell you all that this is very good to hear from Beck and this is very exciting, showcasing that he really believes Rocket Lab can penetrate this market and become a big player in the ever-evolving industry.

**Rocket Lab Making Big Moves Lately:**

¬∑ Bought Virgin Orbit HQ in California, this was a big win for the company, and folk on the sub were very excited to see this happen. Yay! But, sad and unfortunate for Virgin Galactic, which I am sure many of us space enthusiasts had higher hopes for, oh well, not everyone can achieve their dreams.

¬∑ Rocket Lab reached a new Company record of nine launches within a calendar year.

¬∑ Achieved a record of 100% mission success for Electron launches for the year.

¬∑ Successfully launched CAPSTONE mission to the Moon for NASA, including the first demonstration of Lunar Photon spacecraft platform.

¬∑ Successfully deployed two satellites to space for NASA‚Äôs TROPICS mission on the first of two dedicated launches on Electron for the constellation scheduled in May 2023.

¬∑ Announced that the Company will fly a pre-launched 3D printed Rutherford engine on an upcoming mission in Q3‚Äô23, a major step in evolving the Electron launch vehicle into a reusable rocket.

¬∑ Delivered financial results that exceeded the high end of prior guidance for revenue and gross margin.

¬∑ Launched three successful Electron missions in the first quarter for commercial constellation operators HawkEye 360, Capella Space, and BlackSky.

¬∑ Successfully completed the Company‚Äôs first launch from its U.S. launch site, Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2, at the Virginia Spaceport Authority‚Äôs Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on January 24, 2023. The mission deployed three satellites for radio frequency geospatial analytics provider HawkEye 360.

¬∑ Successfully completed the Company‚Äôs fastest turnaround between launches to date ‚Äì just seven days between its 34th Electron launch, ‚ÄúStronger Together‚Äù, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 in Virginia on March 16, 2023, and its 35th Electron launch, ‚ÄúThe Beat Goes On‚Äù, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand on March 24, 2023.

¬∑ Rocket Lab remains the only U.S. commercial small launch provider to successfully deliver satellites to orbit in 2023. Secured a multi-mission contract with Capella Space to launch four more dedicated launches on Electron in 2023.

¬∑ Achieved programmatic milestones for the Company‚Äôs two Photon spacecraft to support NASA‚Äôs ESCAPADE mission to Mars, and for the Photon spacecraft for a Varda Space Industries‚Äô mission to manufacture high-value products in zero gravity. Both Photon programs include Rocket Lab star trackers, reaction wheels, solar panels, flight software, and radios ‚Äì demonstrating the value and strength of the Company‚Äôs vertical integration and in-house supply chain.

# Conclusion: An Ode to Humanity's Future

Rocket Lab has established itself as a leading player in the small satellite launch market, offering dedicated launch services tailored to the needs of small satellite operators. The company's technological capabilities, solid customer base, and innovative approach position it well for future growth.

Those who lived and grew up in the 1960s and 1970s believed that by the 21st century, mankind would be a space-faring civilization. People had a fascination with the unknown. It was embedded in pop culture, in movies like the 2001 Space Odyssey, Alien, and the Star Trek series. But the unfortunate truth is that after Apollo 17 on the 19th of December 1972, mankind has not left low-earth orbit. The American public lost interest, the government cut funding, and the Saturn V rockets were dismantled and replaced by space shuttles in the 1980s (spaceships not even built to leave low-earth orbit). The curiosity and desire to unravel the mystery of the universe are now again filling the hearts of people. Technology is becoming more advanced and cheaper.

With companies like Rocket Lab and Space X, the future is looking bright. We currently live in an era of mass information. One of the hardest aspects of life in the early-21st-century is learning how to filter all this information. The news of the accomplishments of Rocket Lab, Space X, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA), the European Space Agency (ESA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Space Force, are lost in the large volume of collective data. The average person does not believe how close we are to colonizing Luna and Mars; how close we are to becoming a multi-planetary species. If you walked up to someone on the street of New York City, today, and told them that in the mid-2040s, and by the latest, the 2050s, there will be hundreds if not thousands of people living in Earth's orbit, the upper atmosphere of Venus, the Moon, and Mars, the person would dismiss you in disbelief. But the same would have happened if you walked up to a person on the street of New York City on the 19th of July 1962 (before Kennedy‚Äôs speech) and told them that mankind would step foot on the moon in seven years. Companies like Rocket Lab, which will make orbital flight and transportation affordable, will allow for a new era of civilization, one which was only present and dreamed of in science fiction of the past.

[The Earth, as imaged from the Voyager 1 spacecraft, was suspended in a sunbeam, as the interstellar craft exited the Sol system in 1990. Earth is nearly 4 billion miles away in this image. That is us. That is humanity, all of us that have thus far, ever existed. We take to the stars in search of not only answers but in search of a purpose.](https://preview.redd.it/hnr23odlvd4b1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=298a1ee80b0bc5e3dc0ba5c3c61aa6a25c0682c1)

RocketLab_posts.csv,Neutron launching Kuiper Satellites for Amazon?,"Hi All,

I was thinking, what are the chances for Amazon awarding launch contract to RocketLab Neutron for its Kuiper Satellites?

RocketLab is already going to deliver reaction wheels (2-3K a year) for Kuiper. RocketLab also recently launched a high-volume star tracker (maybe also for Kuiper). All in all, seems like RocketLab is going to do a lot of work for Kuiper. Then why not launch also?

Amazon did sign launch contracts with Vulcan Centaur (ULA), New Glenn (BO) and Ariane 6 (ArianeSpace). All these medium to heavy lift launch vehicles are delayed and won't see a multiple launch cadence before 2025/2026. It is even questionable whether ULA and ArianeSpace can achieve a high launch cadence as their vehicles are expendable.

Amazon Kuiper is in a hurry to catch up with starlink, so they do not really have the luxury to wait. Therefore, I think there a good chances that RocketLab will get launch contracts from Amazon Kuiper. Neutron could potentially launch 4 or more times in 2025 and then scale rapidly from there i.e. providing Amazon Kuiper with better performance than all of the current launch contract holders.

A Neutron rocket could put roughly 18 Kuiper satellites (700kg per satellite) in orbit per launch at a price of $50 million. $ per kg will definitely be lower than with Vulcan Centaur and Ariane 6.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Speculation on the long-term evolution of commercial launch in this decade (with an eye towards heavy lift as well as Relativity Space),"Hey all,

Just thought I'd put this out there as purely hypothetical (borderline tinfoil) speculation on what could happen in the years to come as the commercial launch market continues to evolve.

First off, a fun thought exercise - what would you name a potential heavy-lift launch vehicle that Rocket Lab could develop after Neutron?

Peter Beck has mentioned recently that they have no plans on retreading the rocket development path, but if SpaceX manages to get the Starship system operational this decade and it disrupts the industry like everyone thinks it will, Rocket Lab may be forced to adapt once again.

In that case, after looking at a variety of options, I personally like Hadron^1 the most. It already has name recognition thanks to CERN's Large Hadron Collider. Additionally, the neutron itself is a member of the hadron class of subatomic particles.

So, not only would Hadron be a logical progression from a particle physics perspective, it would also have instant name recognition. Just imagine: ""Rocket Lab's Hadron Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle"" - rolls off the tongue rather nicely eh?

Second, I got to thinking about consolidation in the commercial launch sector moving forward, as an economic downturn looms and we exit the near-zero interest rate environment that led to the previous decade's boom in launch startups. Many executives in the industry ([including Beck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qcHd13G6yQ)) have made public statements about this in the past couple of years.

Other small launch newcomers already have strong ties to large defense primes that may suggest acquisition down the line (e.g. Lockheed Martin with ABL and Northrop Grumman with Firefly)

The only two remaining non-""billionaire funded"" U.S. commercial LV players with significant financial runways are Rocket Lab and Relativity Space.

I've read previous threads on this sub discussing Relativity and the sentiment seems to be that despite the fact that they've yet to launch, they are a competitor worth paying attention to due to significant private investor interest, high quality talent (mostly ex-SpaceX), and potentially game-changing proprietary tech.

Once again, if Starship proves to work as advertised, and/or macroeconomic conditions continue to deteriorate, market participants may be forced to consolidate in order to survive. Precedent is currently being set in the satellite operator space as multi-billion dollar players have begun M&A processes under growing pressure from Starlink (e.g. Oneweb / Eutelsat and Viasat / Inmarsat). While less common, we've also previously seen consolidation in the launch industry, with Lockheed + Boeing's ULA JV, Airbus + Safran's ArianeGroup JV, and Orbital + ATK's merger. Aerojet Rocketdyne's recent tie-ups with Northrop and L3Harris also come to mind. Granted, each of these cases is unique, but anything is possible in this space, regardless of how large or established a company is.

Thus, I see no inherent reason why a Rocket Lab + Relativity merger couldn't be possible down the line, assuming both companies continue to grow and execute at pace. (A major assumption, to be sure!)

I realize this is probably the last thing on either company's mind at the moment but hear me out. Below is a big picture list of observations on both companies, with an emphasis on their similarities and potential synergies:

- Co-location at NASA Stennis for both companies' next-generation reusable methalox engine testing: Both Aeon R and Archimedes test complexes will be located fairly close to each other at Stennis. I wouldn't be surprised to see some degree of cross-pollination between the construction, engineering, and technician staff across both programs
- Both companies are vocal champions of additive manufacturing techniques throughout major components of LV production
- Both companies' headquarters are located just 3 miles away from each other in Long Beach
- Rocket Lab has proven to be a pragmatic, execution-rich organization. Relativity has proven to be a forward-looking, ambition-rich organization. Combining these modalities could in theory lead to an organization greater than the sum of its parts - SpaceX, the current market leader, has both of these elements in spades
- With Neutron, Rocket Lab is optimizing for operational efficiency with partial reusability and RTLS as their north star, whereas with Terran-R, Relativity is leaning on highly novel structures with full reusability as their north star. If Relativity manages to crack the full reusability problem at sub-Starship scale,^2 both companies' tech could combine in a unique way for a joint RL/RS designed heavy lift vehicle (possibly the Hadron as spitballed above)
- Both companies have good design, PR, and marketing (see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2GT204CEVk), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aJ5NPt5fSM), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kwAPr5G6WA), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BhkjEc6Q64), and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Vf3MlbtAs)), which helps excite the general public and attract talent

Curious what everyone here thinks of both the HLV name brainstorm and a potential team-up with Relativity. Obviously there is an extremely low chance of either happening in this decade, but it's fun to think about as these companies race to develop vehicles that will ultimately launch next-gen constellations, commercial space stations, interplanetary missions, and much more.

Footnotes

1. Some alternatives: Graviton, Baryon, Fermion
2. Stoke Space's [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzqhZLgpiv0) also claims to have cracked the full-reusability problem but they are much earlier-stage and have less funding at this point in time. Definitely worth keeping an eye on though.

Addendum on March 6th 2023: This post has been brewing in my notes for over 3 months.

RocketLab_posts.csv,"With Starshield, SpaceX readies for battle","PURSUIT OF DEFENSE DOLLARS
What SpaceX has done with Starlink is to visibly demonstrate how commercial space technology serves national security applications, said Peter Arment, aerospace and defense industry analyst at Baird investment bank.

‚ÄúThis helps SpaceX obviously but also helps the entire industry attract investment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe defense spending space is sort of a rising tide at the moment.‚Äù

Before anyone had ever heard of Starshield, other companies in the space industry started making moves to be better positioned to compete in the national security arena.

Commercial launch provider and satellite manufacturer Rocket Lab on Dec. 1 announced it is establishing a U.S.-based subsidiary for defense and intelligence work, including classified programs.

The new business, called Rocket Lab National Security, will have ‚Äúclose engagement with U.S. government customers to understand their mission requirements, which may be dedicated rapid call-up launch, satellite design, build and integration, spacecraft operations or all of the above,‚Äù Rocket Lab spokesperson Murielle Baker said in a statement.

Tess Hatch, vice president of Bessemer Venture Partners, a Rocket Lab investor, said the mood has shifted from a year ago ‚Äúwhen investors in boardrooms were pounding our fists on the table saying ‚Äògrowth at all cost.‚Äô‚Äù Defense customers can be ‚Äúa little lumpy and unpredictable. However, there are massive potential contracts,‚Äù Hatch said Dec. 6 at the TechCrunch Space conference.

‚ÄúWith markets down and maybe commercial needing to push a little more throttle, the diversity of the customer base is so important,‚Äù Hatch said. ‚ÄúThe government is extra helpful for space companies right now when the commercial side isn‚Äôt as efficient.‚Äù",27,3,https://spacenews.com/with-starshield-spacex-readies-for-battle/,0.9919,0.171,0.812,0.016

## What is going to be on board for this flight?

Electron will deploy three satellites for radio frequency
geospatial analytics provider HawkEye 360. The
mission will be the first of three Electron launches for
HawkEye 360 in a contract that will see Rocket Lab
deliver 15 satellites to low Earth orbit between late
2022 and 2024. These missions will grow HawkEye
360‚Äôs constellation of radio frequency monitoring
satellites, enabling the company to better deliver
precise mapping of radio frequency emissions
anywhere in the world.

[](/# MC // section mission)
# Primary Mission: Deployment of payload into correct orbit

Electron will carry a science research satellite by
space systems provider OHB Sweden for the Swedish
National Space Agency (SNSA). The Mesospheric
Airglow/Aerosol Tomography and Spectroscopy
(MATS) satellite is the basis for the SNSA‚Äôs science
mission to investigate atmospheric waves and
better understand how the upper layer of Earth‚Äôs
atmosphere interacts with wind and weather patterns
closer to the ground. MATS was originally due to fly
on a Russian launch service before the mission was
manifested on Rocket Lab‚Äôs Electron.


The Swedish National Space Agency, SNSA, is a central
governmental agency under the Ministry of Education
and Research. SNSA is responsible for national and
international activities relating to space and remote
sensing, primarily research and development.
The mission‚Äôs science partner is the Department of
Meteorology at Stockholm University (MISU).

[](/# MC // section landing)
# Recovery Attempt

Using a modified Sikorsky S-92 large helicopter, Rocket
Lab will attempt to capture the Electron rocket‚Äôs first
stage mid-air as it returns from space after launch.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Time for Rocket Lab to re-consider air-captures?,"So, given that the last two air-capture attempts both ended in failure, I feel it might be time for Rocket Lab to re-consider it's re-usability program. Earlier this year, Rocket Lab managed to [succesfully re-ignite a first stage engine](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/01/rocket-lab-fires-up-its-first-recovered-engine-on-track-to-full-booster-reusability/) after it was retrieved from the ocean. This suggests that air captures may in fact be unnecessary and instead of further promoting the company to investors, it is actually acheiving the opposite effect due to the [negative media coverage](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/04/business/rocket-lab-helicopter-booster-catch-scn/index.html). My personal recommednation would be to cancel the air-capture attempts and retreive all future booster stages from the ocean using the retreival vessel. This avoids putting lives at undue risk for publicity purposes while still enabling the company to re-use the first stage engines. The helicopters can be re-tasked to spot the landing locations of the booster stages for the retrieval vessel.",0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/yme706/time_for_rocket_lab_to_reconsider_aircaptures/,-0.8582,0.016,0.9,0.084

RocketLab_posts.csv,Why use and Oxygen Rich Closed Cycle on Archimedes and not a Fuel Rich Closed Cycle?,Anyone understand why RocketLab hasn't used a fuel rich staged combustion cycle for their new Archimedes engine but is going with Oxygen rich?  From my very limited understanding (Everyday Astronaut school of Rocket Engine Cycles) is seems like once the fuel is CH and not RP1 the coking problems for a fuel rich pre burner disappear.  This problem must have been solved by SpaceX for their CH fuel rich pre burner on the Raptor.  But it seems that one of the big challenges for Raptor was SpaceX developing a new alloy for their O2 rich pre burner for Raptor.  Is RocketLab working on new alloys for this or has rocket engine metallurgy moved on since the start of Raptor development?,41,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xvqw1q/why_use_and_oxygen_rich_closed_cycle_on/,0.9681,0.205,0.716,0.078

RocketLab_posts.csv,"~600 kg, RTLS, multi-core, Electron++ ?","~600 kg to LEO, RTLS, multi-core, Electron++ ?

 &nbsp;

**Rationale**

* Competitors are aiming for this payload class, Astra, Virgin Orbit, Firefly (1,000 kg), Terra 1 (1,500 kg)  
* MDA, with RocketLab, is building 500 kg satellites, could be launched by RL  
* Gain RTLS [propulsive landing] experience  
* Gain landing leg experience  
* Gain relight experience 
* Retain staff building rockets for potentially more customers
* Use returned boosters to increase launch cadence


 &nbsp;

**Proposing**  

* Triple booster first stage, no staging  
* Double second-stage or single extended  
* Landing legs for RTLS  
* Maybe larger fairing with dual second stage with interstage  


 &nbsp;

**Possible configuration**  

* Triangle configuration of boosters (no staging), with landing legs, nosecone on one of the boosters  
* Inline configuration of two second stages (no staging) mounted on two of the boosters
* 1 m  or 2 m fairing (which would require new molds) plus funky interstage


 &nbsp;

**Discussion:**  

* A triple booster should have enough reserve propellant and thrust to lift the RTLS propellant, legs and account for extra drag.  Either triple-engine landing or dual-engine landing possibilities (depending on landing mass).  
* A dual booster would mean unmodified second stages fastened together, provide thrust needed for up to 600 kg to LEO.  
* A payload interstage would be needed.  
* Could call it Anion (extra electrons)",0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xt9yt3/600_kg_rtls_multicore_electron/,0.7269,0.065,0.889,0.046

RocketLab_posts.csv,RocketLab Capsule,"Rocket Lab, during the investor day, presented some illustrations for a human capsule for Neutron. While presenting, the company was very clear that this was not a capsule announcement but they are looking into the topic.

However, what is interesting is the size of the capsule presented with a human for scale. (Another member made a post on how much bigger the capsule is relative to Dragon from SpaceX).

To investigate whether the illustration was a mistake, I did some digging using the 2nd illustration of the capsule with a docking station. I utilized the docking station as a measurement foundation and compared the illustration with a relatively similar picture of a Dragon with a docking station. Here is what I found (rough measurements).

1. RocketLab's capsule is rougly 2.6 times the diameter of the docking station.
2. Dragon is rought 1.8 times the diameter of the docking station.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

1. It seems like that RKLB did not make a mistake when they showed a human for scale. RKLB may indeed be planning a much bigger capsule than Dragon and Starliner. (RKLB rarely makes mistakes on slides and it would be unlikely they made the size mistake on two slides)

Counter-argument; Dragon and Starliner are rougly 12 tonnes. Neutron in expendable mode can deliver 13 tonnes to LEO. Therefore it would be unlikely that they are planning a larger capsule.

Counter-counter argument:

1. RKLB is known for innovation and it is likely that they with the technology of 2025-2026 could develop a much lighter capsule
2. Neutron's performance metrics are based on the rocket performing in a chill mode. More performance could be achieved by pushing the engines to near their limit. i.e. Neutron if need be could potentially deliver +20 tonnes to LEO.

Let me know what you think?

&#x200B;

Update:

ISS docking station actual diameter: 2.4 meters

Estimated dragon diameter: 4.3 (actual 4) meters

Estimated RKLB capsule diameter: 6.2 meters

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcuOSXjevGs&t=2337s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcuOSXjevGs&t=2337s)

&#x200B;

I will now explain why I believe Rocket Lab will design its own manned spacecraft, and will not use Soyuz spacecraft.

&#x200B;

\-Rocket Lab has recently announced that they plan to deliver cargo around the world, (sort of like E2E).

So obviously they will design a re-entry vehicle...then they could adapt it for the manned missions they have announced.

\-If Rocket Lab were to buy a Soyuz capsule, they would be using Russian technology... and there are problems with Russia.

They would also be wasting money if in the future they want to build their own capsule....

And there are many other factors...

\-The Starliner can't be launched on Neutron in the reusable version, and besides, the starliner doesn't even work lol....

\-In the future there will be several space stations, and RL will not be left behind.

Also, for now Europe doesn't have its own spacecraft, the Susie spacecraft is under development, and according to what ArianeGroup has announced, operational flights will arrive in 2030.

The problem with Electron is that it was never originally designed to be re-usable. The company also [over-estimated demand for the small launch industry](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/peter-beck-explains-why-electron-may-only-ever-launch-10-15-times-a-year/) and thus is producing Electron rockets at a faster rate than they are being used. Therefore, re-usability currently serves no purpose other than to boost the company's reputation. I suspect they also do not want another failed catch as this could damage the company's reputation and leed to a loss of confidence amoung investors.

This will surely be a Killer App for SpaceX's upcoming Starship launch vehicle, deploying their upcoming Starlink v2 satellites into orbit. There will surely be a demand for this type of communication network if it works as advertised, fulfilling the promise of what Iridium was supposed to be.

I was wondering whether Rocket Lab with its own in-house expertise from its family of satellite component builders might be able to come up with a comparable solution as this. Something like that would surely create demand for Neutron's launch services, especially with the rapid launch turnaround Neutron is meant for.

So Neutron obviously won't have a fairing as large as Starship's, but could some of the well-known origami techniques be used to create large unfolding antenna arrays that could snugly fit into Neutron's payload fairing for launch? Elon Musk said Starlink v2 would be using the world's most advanced Phased Array antennae, which could both detect the comparatively weaker signals from cellphones and compensate for Doppler frequency shift. Is anything like that within the capabilities of Rocket Lab or its family of subsidiary companies?

Surely a globe-spanning mobile cellular telecom network would be the ultimate demand-driver for the kind of launch cadence Neutron aspires to.",27,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wzw1lb/can_rocket_lab_replicate_starlinktmobile/,0.9614,0.132,0.832,0.037

RocketLab_posts.csv,"Rocket Lab's path to Profitability: Increasing SolAero Gross Margins, Electron Recovery, and Responsive Launches","In Rocket Lab's [earnings call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE) yesterday, they made some very interesting statements about how the company plans to increase gross margins and achieve profitability.

First, Rocket Lab [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE&t=2622s) that increasing gross margin on AolAero is the best thing that they can do to improve profitability on the Space Systems side. Rocket Lab said that they have a 24 month plan to increase SolAero gross margins from ""high single digits"" to a whopping 30%! They said that they are very confident in this plan, and that executing on it is only a matter of time. Rocket Lab said that revenue from the acquired companies SolAero, Advanced Solutions Inc, and Planetary Systems Corporation was $28M in Q2 2022, and the vast majority (> $20M?) was from SolAero. Therefore, increasing the gross margin to 30% on SolAero revenue is a really big deal!

Secondly, Rocket Lab [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE&t=3102s) that for their new [Responsive Space Program](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-introduces-responsive-space-program/), the cost per launch is 15-30% higher than the typical Electron launch price of $7.5M, and the vast majority of that 15-30% markup goes directly to gross margin since most of their launch costs are fixed costs. Between Electron reuse (70% of cost is in the first stage) and responsive launches, I see a clear path to increasing the gross margins of Electron!

These statements really help to paint a clear path to profitability in my mind. With stronger than expected revenues and a clear path to profitability, it‚Äôs no wonder that Rocket Lab stock surged over 20% today. What do you guys think? What do you think Rocket Lab's plans for SolAero are? Increasing automation? Integration of solar panels into other components? Outsourcing of manufacturing?

RocketLab_posts.csv,"My gut feeling: Solaero acquisition was a mistake, and perhaps a very bad one","I expressed a lot of concerns back in December about that acquisition:
 - 5 % gross margins: there is not really any cost savings with this acquisition. Why not just buy the solar panels directly from a third party, just like I assume spaceX does??? SpaceX doesn‚Äôt seem to have any issues sourcing solar panels!
 - Massive 60 % expansion of headcount at rocketlab
 - Rocketlab has 0 experience in solar panels construction
 - Massive distraction on top of the many challenges the company already faces 

To the list above we can now 
 - add a massive market meltdown
 - runaway inflation, which likely is going to be a big deal when selling something manufacturing intensive with 5 % gross margin

Was this acquisition motivated by the revenue increase from the low margin solar panels? I sincerely hope not. Because here‚Äôs the deal: most investors don‚Äôt give any multiple multiple to this.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Is Relativity Space overpromising?,"I acknowledge that this is a bit of a rhetorical question, because RS hasn't launched yet, but that's kind of the point. They haven't launched Terran 1 yet, but they've announced plans with insane deadlines to send a second generation launch vehicle that's going to be as big as Starship to Mars (and beat SpaceX there, no less). Somehow, even though they haven't launched anything, they have enormous amounts of funding and a [pad at Cape Canaveral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_Space#Cape_Canaveral_LC-16). They will be having the [first launch](https://www.spacelaunchschedule.com/launch/terran-1-maiden-flight/) of Terran 1 later this month.

Full admission, I'm biased against RS because I'm invested in RKLB, and RS is a private company which us retail investors aren't able to invest in. If RS is as good as they claim to be, then they would obviously be a threat to RKLB, which until now, has been second best next to SpaceX, and the best space launch investment option on the public markets by far.

At the same time, I see the wild claims that RS makes, and it makes my bullshit detector want to go off. Sure, RS has cool 3D printing tech, but does that really qualify them as rocket designers? Rocket engineering is notoriously hard. Announcing ambitious plans and timelines for a second generation vehicle when you haven't even launched one of your first generation vehicles reeks both of arrogance and of inexperience. It seems pretty obvious that they will want to make many changes to the design of their vehicles and iterate.

Technology wise, I get that they have a cool metal 3D printer, but it makes me cringe every time I hear them say that their technology is powered by ""AI"". To me, that says that the company is relying on buzzwords to lure naive investors that have no understanding of the technology involved. We also know that their rocket is not, in fact, fully 3D printed. I personally doubt that their construction method is particularly cost-effective, but that remains to be seen.

This last point is debatable, but I also feel like the relatively large size of the Terran 1 rocket is an error. It's a fairly large two-stage vehicle. If you've ever used a 3D printer, you know that the time needed to print something increases rapidly with the size of the object. Having a large rocket means that your prints take much longer, which in turn means that you iterate quite a bit slower. RS could have chosen to start by printing a smaller suborbital rocket so they can really test their technology, iterate rapidly on design changes, and then go for an orbital vehicle when they have more experience. Instead they're directly going for a large two-stage rocket and trying to launch it to orbit. If they need to iterate on this, it will take longer and be more costly.

RS is having their first launch later this month. Maybe they'll succeed and we'll all be really impressed that they've nailed it on their first try. Or maybe Terran 1 will blow up, there will be months of delays after that, and we'll eventually find out that RS has more in common with Nikola than SpaceX.",42,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wiex5n/is_relativity_space_overpromising/,0.9524,0.099,0.823,0.078

RocketLab_posts.csv,Rocket Lab generating negative revenue on Electron Launches?,"Hey, so I'm part of a small investor group on Discord which follows space stocks. Recently one of our members [revealed that Rocket Lab is operating electron launches at a net loss](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/998003492503421018/1005151082512662588/IMG_0619.png?width=1200&height=301). He came to this conclusion after digging around in the quarterly earnings reports which report revenues and expenses related to launches and then counted the number of launches in that quarter by referring to Rocket Lab's [completed missions](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/) page. Now obviously, this may not be entirely unexpected for a company that is still relatively new. However, I find the lack of transparency regarding this issue concerning. Investors should not have to go to this level of detail just to uncover that a company is generating negative returns on launches. Obviously, they are generaing revenues from their subsidiary companies as well as the sales of [reaction wheels](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/space-systems/satellite-components/reaction-wheels/) and [star trackers](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/space-systems/satellite-components/star-trackers/). Hopefully, as launch cadence improves and re-usability becomes more streamlined, the company may end up breaking even. Don't get me wrong, I love what Rocket Lab does (it's amazing), but I just feel a little.. annoyed that Peter Beck hasn't stated that they are generating negative revenues from the launches.

&#x200B;

Additional information regarding calculations:

RocketLab_posts.csv,"So now that Astra won‚Äôt be launching anything until probably 2024, what does this mean for Rocket Lab?","Astra has [cancelled](https://spacenews.com/astra-cancels-rocket-3-to-focus-on-larger-vehicle/) the Rocket 3 program and says they won‚Äôt launch any customer payloads until around 2024 when Rocket 4 is ready. Personally, I think Astra will go bankrupt before Rocket 4 is ready. The issue is that Astra is burning through their cash at a rate of $85M per quarter, have zero revenue, and have only $200M in cash left. I don‚Äôt see any good way for Astra to raise more money, either. At the time of this posting, Astra has a $343.40M market cap, which shows that most of the value of the company is just that $200M pile of cash. Once that cash is gone, so is their market cap and their ability to raise more capital.

In their earnings call yesterday, Astra also said that Rocket 3 was not a commercially viable product, and even if it did work reliably, there were simply not enough interested customers for it to be successful. Apparently satellites are growing in size and customers want larger rockets like Terran R, as evidenced by Relativity Space‚Äôs ridiculous [$1.2B backlog](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/30/relativity-space-inks-deal-with-oneweb-reaches-1-2b-in-terran-r-launch-contracts/).

I wonder what this means for Rocket Lab and the future of Electron? In my opinion, it looks like Electron might be the only smallsat launcher left standing. There is little incentive for anyone else to develop a competitor for Electron since it seems that rockets of this size are not commercially viable. But there is a silver lining. Rocket Lab is at least able to mostly break even on their Electron launches. This gives them an extremely cost effective R&D testbed to develop the technology they need for Neutron. Electron also gives Rocket Lab publicity and helps them to build up launch heritage and relationships with customers.

The design chosen by Rocket Lab has quite a few distinct similarities' to the Pioneer Venus 2 but also a couple noticeable differences. One of the similarities is the design of the probe capsule, which is almost identical in shape. The shape of the spacecraft are also fairly similar with the noticeable difference being that Rocket Lab's design places the solar panels on top of the craft, not the sides. Curious to know what other people think about this.

Electron's 27th launch from New Zealand.
==========
Stage 1&2 success. 
==========
Quick Facts:

**Lift-off is scheduled for 0955 UTC from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 Pad B.**

Rocket Lab is launching: 
""Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment, also known as CAPSTONE.""


This pathfinding 55-pound CubeSat, will be the first spacecraft to test the Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) around
the Moon.

Researchers expect this orbit to be a gravitational
sweet spot in space ‚Äì where the pull of gravity from
Earth and the Moon interact to allow for a nearly stable orbit.

The orbit will bring CAPSTONE within 1,000 miles
of one lunar pole on its near pass and 43,500
miles from the other pole at its peak every seven
days, requiring less propulsion capability for
spacecraft flying to and from the Moon‚Äôs surface
than other circular orbits.

CAPSTONE is expected to orbit this area around
the Moon for at least six months to understand the
characteristics of the orbit. The NRHO
provides the advantage of an unobstructed view of
Earth in addition to coverage of the lunar South Pole.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Moat chat,"First off this ain't a DD. This is a motivational wake up to what is actually happening. 


Every month that rocketlab is running, is the moat.


This ain't a 7/11 franchise. This is a business that has all the knowledge and engineering to get to space. Every day, every week, every month something new is learned that gives them an edged. All the layers beyond just a rocket, rocketlab already is refining and gaining new plans and partnerships.


All their previous launches, all that experience, gaining customers, a proven track record, refining, adapting, tweaking, integrating. Rocketlab building parts, building platforms, launching, monitoring, landing, building a process, refining a process.


The amount of experience, retaining customers, providing new experiences and solutions for customers...


...that is the moat. Doing the hard thing, doing it well, and most importantly already doing it. There isn't hopium, there isn't promises, they are already doing it.


Others haven't even scratched the surface of what that all entails. They don't have all the additional staff, processes, customers, solutions, platforms, they are stuck on figuring out step one. They are blowing millions, billions, without even a foundation of a business yet.


Rocketlab is so far ahead that they have a wild tech/intelligence/platform moat that is still far unrealized compared to their stock worth.


I am actually incredibly excited because a lot of this is still to be discovered by others. You really need to grasp how much rocketlab has already accomplished and how fast they are moving on neutron and space systems. Like, this ain't a shop that sells loaves of bread(nothing against a good sour dough, promise). They made a business that escapes the atmosphere, literally leaving the planet to find new opportunities. That is something once only held by the wealthiest and most knowledgable countries. Now we have it from rocketlab, where we individually have the ability, through its stock, to be a part of it. Literally nerd heaven.


Owning some rocketlab stock puts us right there in time, in the history of humanity where we are transitioning to space. Like imagine what you can tell your kids, nephews and neices or grand kids.


The wonderful thing is, you don't even have to imagine, you just do it, and you are a part of all this. Own a piece of this awesomeness. Help make sure it all happens, promote it, champion it. 


I just don't even know what else to say!!! It's so damn exciting.

With all the congress hearings lately claiming UAPs are real, they are here, they hypothesize how they work within our understanding of physics but all agree the technology is not ours.

Let's just play pretend and all of that is 100% real and all of a sudden some alien race made contact and we got access to their gravitational propulsion technology, and are able to travel between our atmosphere, space, other planets, etc all very fast.

Does Rocket Lab just immediately become obsolete and tank? I suppose even if we don't need launch vehicles like rockets, the satellite components business would still be in full operation and working.

Or maybe it is a massive catalyst in humanity's drive for space and motivation to become interplanetary. All of a sudden rocket launches and satellites are #1, 2 and 3 priority and get massive attention and funding.

I thought this would be a fun thought experiment and conversation if we all think outside the box and think open minded!

Electron's 1st stage ability to come back to an area above the ocean via parachutes, to then be caught by a helicopter, was an interesting idea that never materialized.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Will rocket lab make weapons?,"So normally I don't care that much about morals generally and I am aware that companies like lockheed martin don't give a flying sh\* wether I buy a stock or not. Humans get bombed (or not bombed) regardless wether peasants like me buy a stock. I understand that it makes no difference, but still I don't think its moral to invest in stocks that build weapons. So I wanted to buy rocket lab stocks and I am wondering are they planning to make weapons in the near future? Or will they stick to peaceful space stuff?

Edit: With weapons I am specifically referring to bombs or other devices designed to activly hurt or kill people. I am not talking about missiles in general. Also I don't care about it if the rockets accidently crash and hurt the environment. The earth will certainly carry on without us. However I think its immoral to take away life, as in killing humans. Therefor (and thats just personal, not judging investors) I don't want to invest in stocks that build weapons (specifically bombs or WoMD designed to kill humans). Excluding explosives that are not used to harm humans (nuking an asteroid flying towards earth or exploding a mountain to mine diamonds). I just don't want my invested money used to actively hurt other people. However I don't care about espionage, cars and engines that hurts the environment or climate change or something like that. As I said my morals are not high. Its just that I draw the line at bombing people. I know its irrational, but thats just how I think.

RocketLab_posts.csv,I hope what I'm thinking doesn't happen,"I have a theory about why Blue Origin might finally cancel the launch of the Rocket Lab probes.

It was recently revealed that Blue Origin had applied for a license from the FAA to ship the Blue Moon MK1 in March 2025. (https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueOrigin/comments/1eqf17f/blue\_moon\_mk1\_pathfinder\_net\_march\_2025/)

A few days ago Bloomberg revealed that the hardware of the second and third New Glenn ship had been damaged in internal company tests, if the report is accurate, BO only has a single New Glenn ship tested and ready to fly, with the urgency of BO to demonstrate their lunar rover for missions to NASA while Starship is in development, they may have their internal interests as priority. (https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/08/21/bezos-blue-origin-suffers-fiery-setback-building-new-rocket/)

Let us remember that the probes that Rocket Lab has manufactured are launch class D, low-cost and these can be delayed, since they are not an urgent priority like classes A and B would be.

These are my thoughts, maybe I'm wrong and everything is ready for launch, but if Blue Origin decides in the end that they will not be able to meet the schedule for the window, it is possible that they are considering this path of prioritizing their lunar module since they are very profitable missions that NASA spends a lot of money

Ahead of earnings I've been doing some research. I'm fairly ok with this quarter earnings meeting the targets of 98m assuming the space system forecast was accurate. Traditionally they've been pretty close so maybe +/- 1m but overall they've had all successful launches done.

My issue is for the upcoming quarter. Didn't they guide for like 6 launches this quarter? And more so for the entire year it was around 22/24. I really don't think this seems feasible right now. 

A possible downwards revision in launches in the guidance could be bearish news for this stock right? We could take a big hit that basis?

A delay/downwards revision in launches is either due to the fault of customers not having satellites ready to go or just a big lag between when Rocket lab get the electron rockets ready for launch.

The other side is the good news which could be them saying they'd be able to hit the target launches and possible news of neutron.",8,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1chca1w/downward_revision_for_q2_launches/,0.6149,0.087,0.848,0.065

RocketLab_posts.csv,Does Rocket Lab have a future with its space rockets?,"Many startups have emerged in this new boom in space exploration in the US, I think we are clear about who is the most influential in terms of rocket construction, SpaceX, Rocket Lab and Blue Origin.

But there is also a group of startups that are not interested in building rockets, because they are clear that they cannot compete with the main 3, so they are dedicating their efforts to trying to offer other services related to payload, saleslites, software, among others. . services that may arise, but we will not talk about them, we will focus on SpaceX, Blue Origin and Rocket Lab, which is what is expected of them in the coming years and this is where I want to make it clear that it is my perception that I will say to below and this may not happen as I will say.

To begin with, I think that SpaceX and Blue Origin have some points in common, not only does it have a strong backing of money, but its CEOs are people with certain power, who may have certain ties with politicians, this in some way . may influence certain future government contracts.

As for Rocket Lab, it is a company that comes from nowhere and is making its way with its own resources, this is where I want to remain skeptical, I don't know if Rocket is aware that it can be very difficult to compete directly with these 2 companies in the future, maybe I'm wrong, but I have the feeling that Rocket Lab will eventually focus on offering services like the other startups they mention at the beginning want to do and will slowly abandon rockets.

I love what Rocket Lab is doing.  They are putting up satellites for lots of different companies from different countries.  Their work is having a large positive impact for employees in New Zealand and in the U.S.  They are walking the walk and not just talking the talk like a bunch of these other professed space companies.  It just irks me that as Beck is doing what needs to be done to be successful, the CEO of their biggest competitor met with a presidential candidate today who is asking for money.  You know if that happens there will be an understanding that SpaceX gets even more preferential treatment than anyone else.

In terms of durability, will carbon fiber still allow neutron to be reused a high number of times? I‚Äôm especially curious about reusability because of Rocket Lab‚Äôs goal of eventually having the capability to relaunch within 24 hours. 

Is it also possible Rocket Lab is becoming increasingly better equipped to manufacture carbon fiber materials, and they‚Äôre capitalizing on this more than SpaceX?",30,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1b8721b/neutrons_use_of_carbon_fiber/,0.9324,0.139,0.861,0.0
RocketLab_posts.csv,Estimating Neutron first launch date based on publicly announced milestones,"Reposting with some updates to assumptions, from a different account for privacy reasons. Calculations haven't changed, and reference data is shown in the table at the bottom.

A little out of interest and mostly out of boredom, I decided to collate some public statements around Neutron development milestones to estimate the delay to Neutron's first launch date. For this, I collected statements from:

* Presentations available on Rocket Lab's investor relations page
* Archived versions of the Neutron page on the Rocket Lab website

This work could be expanded significantly by trawling through videos, interviews, etc as well (but not by me, this was already only mildly less boring than what I was avoiding doing). It is only a very simple analysis, with some large assumptions being made. Of course, these are only adjustments to public timelines and contain no inside knowledge of Rocket Lab's schedules or internal estimates.

Here's a chart of the results up front:

[Chart of Neutron first launch date estimates. The x-axis is the date that the statement of a milestone was made \(either Archimedes first hot fire or LC-3 readiness\).](https://preview.redd.it/gx0p4rpf4mmc1.png?width=3126&format=png&auto=webp&s=f13b2973239623152232b2c6b00da92ff294b353)

There are two different estimates based on two different approaches for each public statement date:

1. Simple Delay - assumes the amount of work after the milestone date remains the same as the original schedule, and adds the delay to the original launch date of 31 Dec 2024. This means that if Archimedes first hot fire is delayed by one year, the first launch date is delayed by one year.
2. Proportional Delay - this assumes that the effort estimates for the whole schedule are off by some factor, and applies that factor to the remaining activities as well. I.e., if it takes twice as long to reach Archimedes first hot fire from project start, it will also take twice as long to reach first launch from project start.

There are obviously a fair few assumptions going into this very basic analysis:

* Archimedes and LC-3 readiness are on the critical path to first launch. This means any delay to either of these is a delay to first launch. None of the calculated dates above assume a delay in both, only one or the other (and all but one is based on a delay in Archimedes).
* It does not account for any ""accelerations"" such as the company throwing significantly more people or money at the program, purchasing more components rather than building in house, etc. It also assumes that any planned ramp up in personnel is included in the original timeline and any other timelines shared publicly by the company.
* It assumes publicly announced dates were the best dates known to the company at the time, and takes them at face value on this.
* These two models for estimating delay are valid.
* When milestones were only listed as being completed in ""Q3"", the latest date in that quarter or month was assumed.
* When milestones were listed on the timeline on the Neutron page (only sorted by year, but in order), best guess was applied for delivery date to try and be most reasonable.
* It includes all delays - including from changing Archimedes architecture and having to redo a bunch of work there.

**What does this tell us?**

Neutron is probably delayed based on the assumptions made here, without a significant change in approach or spend - this analysis estimates to 2026 in all likelihood. This isn't a validated approach to estimating first launch of a new rocket, so you could dismiss it entirely if you want.

I personally think the first launch will be somewhere in between the Simple Delay and Proportional Delay (a bit closer to the Simple Delay) as the company will be trying to accelerate as much as they can to recover the timeline, and the Proportional Delay estimates are therefore extremely conservative. But at this scale, it only takes a few simple mistakes to significantly delay a program, so who knows.

**If you wanted to take this further**

I would recommend two next steps:

1. Add in more information sources (interviews, podcasts, videos, info from Electron launch livestreams, etc)
2. Perform the same analysis for other companies' first rockets that have actually launched to roughly assess the validity or accuracy of the method

Tl;dr - just look at the pretty graph

Has anyone else been getting emails from ""Rocket Lab"" saying they have positions open and would like to conduct an interview with me. It seems fine at first but the more I look at the paperwork and such I am pretty sure it is a scam that someone is doing. So if someone see's it be careful I doubt that it is the real company. I can attach a screengrab of the email I have got a few times now. Then once you answer the email like an automated one sends again saying to contact them through teams and to continue with the interview through there. I am pretty positive this is a scam but I haven't talked with them other than sending the first email.

RocketLab_posts.csv,"LC-1A vs LC1-B, choice of launch pad in New Zealand","RocketLab's first 23 Electron launches were from LC-1A in New Zealand.

In 2022 they finished construction of a new pad, LC-1B, near the original and intended to increase launch frequency. 

The next 15 New Zealand launches in a row were from LC-1B. (And some from a third launchpad in America). 

Why is there such a strong preference for LC-1B? Is it better than LC-1A in some way? Is LC-1A undergoing upgrades currently? LC-1B was built five years later so might be a better pad and they've gone back to make the same changes to LC-1A?    
Or is the plan to ignore LC-1A and stick to LC-1B, improve launch frequency with a better pad rather than improving frequency by using two pads? I did wonder if they were modifying the pad ready for Neutron but that's a much larger rocket so they'd probably need to build a whole new pad rather than upgrading the oldest one.

## What is going to be on board for this flight?

The Active Debris Removal by Astroscale-Japan (ADRAS-J) mission consists of a spacecraft developed and operated by Astroscale aiming to rendezvous with and characterize a large piece of debris. Its target is the H-2A upper stage left in Low Earth Orbit after the launch of the GOSAT Earth observation satellite in 2009.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Sources indicate that the customer is likely the Space Development Agency.," 

SDA, an organization under the U.S. Space Force, is building a mesh[ network of military satellites](https://spacenews.com/space-development-agency-renames-constellation-to-reflect-focus-on-u-s-warfighter/?preview_id=140632&preview_nonce=0118ef1bb4&preview=true&_thumbnail_id=141872) in low Earth orbit known as the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.

SDA Director Derek Tournear speaking at a conference earlier this month said the agency was negotiating a contract with an unspecified supplier for 18 satellites to expand the U.S. military low Earth orbit constellation.

One of the portions of SDA‚Äôs proliferated architecture is the [Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta](https://spacenews.com/space-development-agencys-data-transport-satellites-get-more-complex/), made up of communications satellites to enable beyond line-of-sight connectivity for military forces on the ground.¬†

Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta is projected to have 90 satellites. The agency in August announced it awarded $1.5 billion in contracts to Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman for 72 Beta satellites.

Tournear said Dec. 7 at a National Security Space Association event that SDA was planning to add another 18 Beta satellites to the constellation and was in negotiations with another vendor that he did not disclose.

The Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta satellites ‚Äî projected to launch in 2026 and 2027 ‚Äî will carry radios using the UHF (Ultra High Frequency) and S-band frequencies that military and intelligence units rely upon for voice and low-speed data transmissions.

‚ÄúWe are looking at putting another approximately 18 satellites on contract, and we‚Äôre working with a third vendor to do that, and we should make that announcement shortly,‚Äù Tournear said Dec. 7 at the NSSA forum.¬†

According to Rocket Lab‚Äôs SEC filing, the contract includes a base amount of $489 million, with incentives and options worth $26 million. ‚ÄúWork under the agreement will begin immediately with the delivery of the space vehicles to the customer for launch slated for 2027, operation of the satellites through 2030, and an option to operate the satellites through 2033.‚Äù

## What is going to be on board for this flight?

QPS-SAR-5 is a synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) satellite that will join a constellation after QPS-SAR-6 already in orbit. iQPS‚Äôs satellites are small, high-performance SAR satellites that use a lightweight, large, stowable antenna to collect high resolution images of Earth, even through clouds and adverse weather conditions.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Why is RocketLab the only launch provider with a Photon equivalent?,"Photon is a really cool addition to RocketLab's Electron rocket.

It blurs the lines between being a part of the payload and part of the launch vehicle, in a way it's both at once. From the customer's perspective it must be really useful to have Photon as an option when launching your payload. It can provide extra thrust to reach higher orbits than Electron alone, or it can provide the orbit circularisation burn at apogee, in both cases removing the need for the payload to handle those burns and keeping the final payload mass low. But it's also a communications bus to talk to Earth, has precision guidance systems and star tracking to assist in those final burns, further reducing payload complexity.

I was looking up Photon to make this post and I discovered they've made it even better than I already thought it was. The CAPSTONE mission to the moon last year used an upgraded Photon with an upgraded engine. They're marketing it as a full satellite bus with solar panels and radio antennae for missions to Mars or Venus. I thought it was just the kick-stage for the last little nudge to the correct orbit, I didn't realise it was so capable.

Which feeds more into my question, why doesn't anyone else have a Photon equivalent?

RocketLab's website describes Photon as being ""Vertically integrated with in-house subsystems based on constellation-scale manufacturing capabilities"". Yeah, it's made by people who routinely make and launch rockets, uses known parts and subsystems with known behaviours and capabilities. It just makes sense that the rocket manufacturer can make a really effective satellite bus, especially for customers where this might be their first satellite. I wonder if the customer base of smallsat providers / first launches is why this is relevant for RocketLab but not SpaceX. In theory SpaceX make a bigger and better kickstage/satellite-bus with Draco/Superdraco engines and help people launch more capable satellites. But Falcon 9 is so much bigger that their customers are usually larger and more capable of managing their own payloads. Electron is so much smaller and more of their customers are smallsats / first ever launches and they need to lean more heavily on the launch provider.

It may also be that Falcon 9's second stage has excess capacity compared to Electron's second stage. Apart from Starlink launches very few Falcon 9 launches come within 20% of the max payload capacity so they just use the second stage for circularisation burns or finessing the orbital insertion. Electron can't do that because it's so close to the mass limits and it's more efficient to ditch the second stage mass and use a smaller kickstage for circularisation burns.

But I'm just guessing blind really. I'd like to see SpaceX develop a Photon equivalent for Falcon 9. Or someone else, maybe Stoke or Relativity Space or ISRO.",35,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/176zsgg/why_is_rocketlab_the_only_launch_provider_with_a/,0.9909,0.09,0.897,0.013

**Reused Rutherford Engine Successfully Flies on 40th Mission!** 

You   read that right! On August 24 (NZST), we successfully launched our  40th  Electron mission, called ‚ÄúWe Love the Nightlife,‚Äù for Capella  Space.  Not only did we deliver Capella‚Äôs satellite to orbit, but we  also  demonstrated some significant milestones in evolving Electron into  a  reusable rocket.¬†

For  the  first time, we reused a Rutherford engine that had previously flown  on  our ‚ÄúThere And Back Again‚Äù mission in May 2022. The engine worked   flawlessly on its second flight as it took Electron to space. Then the   first stage returned to Earth with a successful ocean splashdown in the   Pacific Ocean.¬†

Hot on the heels  of ‚ÄúWe Love the Nightlife,‚Äù we‚Äôre launching another  dedicated Electron  launch for Capella. The ‚ÄòWe Will Never Desert You‚Äô  mission is scheduled  for lift-off from Launch Complex 1 as soon as 19  September. The  mission will be our third launch for Capella this year ‚Äì  we're on a  roll! ¬†

* BlackSky,   a leading provider of real-time geospatial intelligence and global   monitoring services, which has launched on six Electron missions since   2019, [signed a block buy deal for five Electron launches](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=85cc888a2e&e=56a66a2a9a)   for their Gen-3 satellites beginning in 2024. Fun fact: BlackSky has   used Electron as a launch vehicle more than any other single commercial   customer!¬†¬†
* A new, double-launch deal with NASA to deliver their climate change research-focused mission, [PREFIRE](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=45378f0d66&e=56a66a2a9a),   is now scheduled to launch in May 2024. NASA's PREFIRE (Polar Radiant   Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment) mission will help close a gap in   understanding of how much of Earth‚Äôs heat is lost to space, especially   from the Arctic and Antarctica. This will be our 7th and 8th mission  for  NASA since 2018. (Graphic we made of 2 launches)¬†¬†
* Last but not least, [we signed a deal with Japanese Earth imaging company Synspective ](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=8e1595f672&e=56a66a2a9a)to   launch two dedicated Electron missions. Rocket Lab has been launching   for Synspective since 2020 when the Company deployed the first  satellite  in Synspective‚Äôs synthetic aperture radar (SAR)  constellation. Since  that first mission, Rocket Lab has been the sole  launch provider for  Synspective‚Äôs StriX constellation to date,  successfully deploying three  StriX satellites across three dedicated  Electron launches¬†

Rocket Lab Wins Industry of the Year Award for Stennis Location

Rocket Lab received the prestigious [Industry of the Year Award](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=42323fcd30&e=56a66a2a9a)   at the Hancock Chamber Business & Industry Awards Gala in August.   The annual awards recognize outstanding achievements in citizenship,   industry and business in Hancock County, Mississippi. ¬†  
We opened our  facility at the Stennis Space Center in 2022 and the site  will be used  to test the new Archimedes engines for the Neutron rocket  coming in  2024.¬†

When   we expanded our Space Systems division, we created a vertical   integration strategy where we could build essential elements of a   spacecraft for our own satellites and those built by others. The idea   behind this was everything going to space should have a Rocket Lab logo   on it!¬†

Speaking of‚Ä¶¬†                                      **NASA Psyche Mission** 

NASA‚Äôs  Psyche mission, which will orbit a metal-rich asteroid of the  same  name in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, is  scheduled  to launch in less than 30 days on 5 October 2023! ¬†

The spacecraft will use a huge Rocket Lab solar array that will power the spacecraft during its 4-billion-kilometer journey.¬†

**MethaneSAT Mission** 

MethaneSAT,  scheduled to launch no earlier than January 2024, is an  Earth  observation satellite that will monitor and study global methane   emissions to combat climate change. We are providing multiple elements   to make this mission a success including developing the Mission   Operation Center, the solar panels to power the spacecraft, and the   separation system that will eject the satellite to its orbit. This   mission is jointly funded and operated by the Environmental Defense   Fund, an American NGO, and the New Zealand Space Agency ‚Äì the country‚Äôs   first space science mission! ¬†

**Neutron Update**

Neutron,   our mega constellation launcher, continues its development on  schedule.  We‚Äôve now begun Stage 2 tank testing including cryogenic fill  and  pressure cycles to determine structural and sealing integrity and   performance, hydrostat test to prove the structural integrity of the   structure, domes, and hatches, and the fill, press, vent and de-tank   systems and procedures among other structural tests.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Thoughts on Ashlee Vance's new book?,"I just finished When the Heavens Went on Sale, Ashlee Vance's new book detailing Planet Labs, Rocket Lab, Astra, and Firefly. I read Vance's book on Musk when it came out and learned a lot from it. This new book had some really great history and details, and gives us a very inside view of the founding of these exciting companies. However, I must say it was relatively unbalanced. The section on Rocket Lab was short and sweet, and tried to include some negatives/controversies where there weren't really any. The other sections were rife with massive issues with the founders, conflicts, etc. I was honestly looking to learn about companies besides Rocket Lab so I could diversify my position in the space economy, but after reading I just want to hold RKLB more because the others have so many issues. The sections on Astra and Firefly seemed so hopeful, but blatantly ignored the reality that Rocket Lab has worked up a regular cadence with a flight proven vehicle while they are still floundering around.

I did learn some new stuff about Rocket Lab, like how the first electron launch when flawlessly and it was actually a US government software issue that caused them to terminate. What a shame. However, the section on Astra seemed really drawn out when it was effectively chapter after chapter of ""they tried to launch a rocket, it was delayed/blew up"" and especially knowing that they never got Rocket 3 to work and won't launch another rocket until 2025, when they're out of cash.

I think the main takeaway for me was how the US government has really muddled the space industry by overreaching. E.g. everyone at NASA having 0 vision besides Pete Worden, multiple agencies cockblocking Max Polyakov for being Ukrainian, and the restrictions on Rocket Lab's development given that most of it happens in New Zealand. 

I wanted to see what you all thought of the book, if you had different impressions, and just get a conversation going around it. While the book should get some more people looking at Rocket Lab, I think it really underplays their accomplishments while trying to inflate the progress of the competition.",19,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1526awp/thoughts_on_ashlee_vances_new_book/,0.9748,0.095,0.882,0.024

# Introduction

With the 2024 first launch of the Rocket Lab Mega Constellation Launcher‚ÄîThe Neutron‚Äîfast approaching, I decided it is high time for a more up-to-date DD on Rocket Lab. A lot is happening in the industry, the company, and the world. I have decided to dive into the future, fundamentals, industry, funding, financials, dreams, and of course, the memes of the aspiring space company. Now, I am posting my DD into both of the Rocket Lab subreddit, as I am new to writing DD and I want to hit as wide of an audience as I can. One disclaimer (for those who do not like stock talk), this DD is not meant to encourage buying of the stock, nor is it financial advice or a stock-only DD, I merely want to dive into this company and simply spark some discussion on it!

Now, Rocket Lab is a private aerospace manufacturer and small satellite launch service provider. The company was founded in 2006 by Peter Beck and is headquartered in Long Beach, California, with additional facilities in New Zealand and Australia. Rocket Lab specializes in the development and launch of small rockets capable of delivering payloads of up to 300 kilograms to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab‚Äîself-designated as a leader in launch and space systems‚Äîis a company that has a chance at becoming a highly profitable giant over the next decade and beyond. In my honest opinion, Rocket Lab currently thrives off of the crumbs of the current space industry ecosystem. With Space X increasingly focused upon one goal‚Äîthanks to their controversial, yet nevertheless, fearless leader‚Äîbeing Mars, Rocket Labs can (and in my opinion will) become one of the go-to space companies for low earth orbit launches in the near term and in the long-term become one of the go-to space company for launches between the Moon, Venus, and Mars as well. Rocket Lab currently lives off of the crumbs left behind by NASA, Space X, and the United States military-industrial complex.

[  Like these two legends from the movie War Dogs, Rocket Lab is determined to become the go-to space company for transporting all types of goods into orbit. For those of you who have not seen the movie \(I personally highly recommend it\), essentially, when these two start their arms-dealing company, they focus upon all of the small contracts that the government is putting out for arms supplies. The contracts that the big players are ignoring, due to their small sizes, even so, these small contracts are worth hundreds of thousands to low millions. Now, this is where Rocket Lab currently lies in the industry.](https://preview.redd.it/j6wloa05vd4b1.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fc5120309359cb8789b861e68009133ef92d376)

[ \\""A new space race has begun, and most Americans are not even aware of it. This race is not \[about\] political prestige or military power. This new race involves the whole human species in a contest against time.\\"" - Ben Bova ](https://preview.redd.it/iliovpg7vd4b1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=f22e8c01f45a403829c6c681966f1a9a53fab213)

Now, before I dive into everything here, I need every to understand that this industry is on the verge of immense change and rapid evolution. We are currently in the first stage of the world‚Äôs Second Space Race. As a student of History, I can confidently tell you that there are murmurings within the historical community, that this is the case, beginning with the creation and success of Space X‚Äôs first reusable rocket: the Falcon 9. On December 21st of 2015, when the first Falcon 9 was launched and the landing was successful with the first stage fully recovered, the race began. In the same way that there is no single company above all others in the airline, shipping & transportation, or car manufacturing industries, is the same reason I do not believe that Space X will alone run the space industry‚Äôs transportation needs. There is plenty of room for companies like Rocket Lab to fill the gaps Space X cannot and in a decade‚Äôs time, there will be plenty of room for even more companies. Yet, there are no companies that are even close to competing with Space X‚Äîother than Rocket Lab‚Äîat this time. Now, I won‚Äôt go deeply into most of these competitors in this deep dive, but to be short, Astra is on the verge of total failure, Virgin Galactic has been playing an entirely different game‚Äîspace tourism, which there is a massive market for, just perhaps won‚Äôt be penetrated by them‚Äîthey likewise seem to be failing. While Blue Origin has been playing a strong game and Space X an even stronger one, albeit more and more focused solely on Mars as the years go on.

[ Here you can see the 1-year charts of Rocket Lab, Astra, Virgin, and Boeing for reference, as you can see, these charts speak volumes. Rocket Lab has been having a tough year but has found a nice bottom and is consistently bouncing from lows in the $3.6-4 range. While Astra has been reduced to a penny stock, with their future unknown. Virgin Galactic is only maintaining below Rocket Lab‚Äôs share price, partly due to the large number of Retail investors that do not know much and refuse to let it die, coupled with a small hope that the company can recover in the coming years. Boeing is here for reference as to what a successful, large-cap company involved in a similar industry \(and the space industry as well\), should look like over the course of a decent year. ](https://preview.redd.it/4lgxhawavd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d24878b2d7dc72b1e5c87ccd01d67c077485001a)

*Now, there are a few assumptions that I am making that we need to cover before diving into the real DD:* Whether it be because we live in the beginnings of a second Space Race (fueled by privatized space companies and the world‚Äôs governments) or because of technological advancement and a rising interest in space, the increase in rocket launches, space development (in Earth‚Äôs orbit, the Moon, and Mars), and the lowering costs of space launches‚Ä¶ it will become exponentially cheaper, easier, and faster to launch into orbit and the industry as a whole will have a massive boom‚Äîakin, in a way, to the industrial revolution‚Äîover the mid-to-late 2020s into the early 2030s. With the mid-to-end 2030s and early 2040s, we will see massive developments in terms of low-Earth orbit manufacturing facilities, tourist destinations, and stations, as well as settlements on the Moon for mining and refueling for greater exploration and colonization of the Sol System as a whole.

Now these are in part assumptions, but I think once one does the research and looks at the fact, all of this is very achievable. Even if it does not occur in this way, you can shift the dates by an additional decade and every time you do, the more likely, easier, and cheaper it all becomes.

Rocket Lab's business model revolves around providing cost-effective and frequent access to space for small satellite operators. The company aims to simplify the process of deploying satellites by offering dedicated launches on its Electron rocket. Rocket Lab operates as an end-to-end service provider, handling the entire launch process from mission planning and payload integration to launch and on-orbit operations.

# Section 1: Rocket Lab Takes Flight! The Electron & the Neutron

[  ‚ÄòRocket Lab is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, complete spacecraft design and manufacturing, satellite components, flight software, and an on-orbit management.‚Äô ‚Äì Rocket Labs](https://preview.redd.it/nbt3cd8dvd4b1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc518b0149113dc115f082394c2b6e8b33e36707)

Rocket Lab's primary launch vehicle, the Electron, is a two-stage rocket powered by Rutherford engines, which use electric-pump-fed LOX/RP-1 propellants. The Electron is designed to optimize cost, flexibility, and rapid launch capability for small satellites. Rocket Lab has demonstrated numerous successful launches since its inaugural flight in 2017, showcasing its technological prowess and reliability. The small satellite market has been growing rapidly, driven by increased demand for data collection, communications, and Earth observation. Rocket Lab's focus on dedicated launches for small satellites positions it well to capture a significant portion of this expanding market. The company has already established a solid customer base, securing contracts with government agencies, research institutions, and commercial entities.

Rocket Labs‚Äîat the time of writing this‚Äîhas had 37 launches‚Äîwith a 91.89% success rate‚Äîdeployed 164 satellites, operates 3 launch pads, and is maintaining 3 Photon Satellites in the Earth‚Äôs orbit. Of the 164 satellites launched by Rocket Labs, they were commissioned to do so by a wide variety of clients, from NASA, Space Force, DARPA, to Canon. Rocket Labs is supported by Future Fund: Australia‚Äôs Sovereign Wealth Fund, Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Data Collective, Greenspring Associates, ACC, Promus Ventures, L One W One Ltd., and Lockheed Martin.

Rocket Lab‚Äôs main rocket, the Electron‚Äîbuilt and operated by Rocket Lab‚Äîhas flown 37 times and been successful 34 times, with only 3 failures. Rocket Lab‚Äôs key areas of business penetration lie in the launch of mid-sized service rockets, the manufacturing of space systems and satellites, and their adept ability to manufacture industrial space parts, applications, and proponents. The latter of which, they are sort of unopposed in terms of competition.

The Neutron‚ÄîRocket Lab‚Äôs medium-lift, mega constellation launcher‚Äîwill be able to launch 13,000 kilograms into low Earth orbit and it will be ‚Ä¶drum roll please‚Ä¶ reusable! The current goal is for it to launch in 2024. It will be designed for not only low earth orbital supply missions, but also deep space missions, and even human spaceflight. It will be fairing a design allowing for full reusability of the first stage and it will be lightweight, being made of Rock Lab‚Äôs own carbon composite structure. The home base for the Neutron will be at the Neutron Production Complex and the launch pad at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility and Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.

[ ‚ÄòThe Neutron Production Complex will be home to a rocket production, assembly, and integration facility, as well as a dedicated launch pad for the Neutron rocket located on the southern end of Wallops Island. The estimated 250,000 square foot state-of-the-art complex will be constructed on a 28-acre site adjacent to the Wallops Island Flight Facility and will include a Launch Control Center, Rocket Lab‚Äôs fifth global operations center for launch activities and on-orbit operations. To support rapid production of the Neutron rocket, current plans for the complex include automated fiber placement robotic production systems capable of laying up meters of Neutron‚Äôs new, specially formulated carbon composite structures in minutes. As a reusable rocket, Neutron is designed to land back on the Launch Complex 3 pad after a mission and from there it would be returned to the production complex for refurbishment and re-flight.‚Äô ](https://preview.redd.it/k592skwfvd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=279742c6d6196d860258d747af98f84e71b71470)

With Space X dominating large-load space orbital flight and transportation, Rocket Labs, in my honest opinion, is where Space X was roughly something like 6-8 years ago. While Rocket Lab intends to compete with Space X‚Äîwhether it will be considered competition in an industry this brand new and small, time will tell‚Äîfor cargo and humans to the low Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and even Venus! Space X and Elon Musk have made it abundantly clear that the goal of Space X is the large-scale settlement of Mars. While later models of Rocket Lab‚Äôs Neutron will be able to go to Mars and Venus, it appears that is not their main goal. In the near term (being the next two decades), they will be looking to dominate the low Earth orbit and Moon market as well as the manufacturing of industrial space parts, applications, and proponents.

# Section 2: The Space Industry & Company Fundamentals

Rocket Lab faces competition from other commercial launch providers, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. However, the company differentiates itself by specializing in small satellite launches, offering a tailored solution for this niche market. Rocket Lab's Electron rocket provides the advantage of dedicated launches and the flexibility to reach specific orbits, making it an attractive option for small satellite operators.

Rocket Lab has raised significant funding through various investment rounds, securing capital from venture capital firms, strategic partners, and government entities. Notable investors include Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Lockheed Martin. The company's ability to attract substantial investment indicates confidence in its business model and growth potential. Rocket Lab operates within the regulatory framework of the countries in which it launches its rockets. The company holds necessary licenses and approvals from government agencies, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Compliance with safety regulations and adherence to environmental guidelines are crucial aspects of Rocket Lab's operations.

Despite its achievements, Rocket Lab faces several risks and challenges. The space industry is highly competitive, and the success of the company depends on its ability to secure launch contracts and maintain a steady launch cadence. Regulatory changes, launch failures, or delays could impact Rocket Lab's operations and reputation. Additionally, the emergence of new technologies or market disruptors could pose a threat to the company's market position

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room, the Quarterly Results. To preface, negative quarterly results mean‚Äîpardon my French‚Äîjack-shit (at least in the short term) for a company such as Rocket Lab, that is looking at penetrating a market such as the space industry. We are going to look at the past four Quarterly Results in chronological order.

**Q2 2022 Report:** Rocket Lab achieved record revenue of $55.5 million, showing significant growth compared to the previous quarter (36% sequential growth) and the same quarter in the previous year (392% YoY growth). Despite the revenue growth, the company reported a negative EPS of $-0.08, indicating a net loss for the quarter.

**Q3 2022 Report:** Another record revenue was achieved, reaching $63.1 million, with a sequential growth of 14% and an impressive YoY growth of 1,093%. The company's EPS improved slightly to $-0.07 but still remained negative. The fourth quarter revenue is expected to be lower, ranging between $51 million and $54 million, as a launch customer's push extends into 2023.

**Q4 2022 Report:** The company's revenue for Q4 reached $51.8 million, showing a healthy year-over-year growth of 88%. The full-year revenue for fiscal 2022 amounted to $211 million, reflecting substantial growth of 239% compared to the previous year. The EPS remained negative at $-0.08.

**Q1 2023 Report:** The revenue for Q1 2023 was $54.9 million. Increasing revenue by 35% in the first quarter of 2023. Revenue from their launch business was $19.6 million, up $12 million from the prior quarter. Their EPS was $-0.08, indicating strong maintenance of their business. The second quarter is expected to show a significant revenue increase, with an estimated range of $60 million to $63 million.

Now, what does this all tell us? Firstly, they were very forthcoming with the quarterly expectations. Something one might think is not a big deal, but considering how a lot of publicly traded companies operate, this is a good thing. In each of their earnings reports, they have nearly exactly estimated their results, showing they are not attempting to mislead investors. The company has experienced impressive revenue growth throughout the reported quarters, indicating strong market performance and demand for its products/services. However, the negative EPS values suggest that the company is still operating at a net loss. From a shareholder‚Äôs perspective, the company's focus should be on achieving profitability and reducing the negative EPS, while maintaining consistent revenue growth. In my opinion, this stock is sitting just below a fair market value for what it is right now, sitting at just over $4, considering they are not fully profitable. Yet Rocket Lab continues to grow its business, making more contracts, and it stands a competitive chance. If they can turn a profit within 2-3 years, I think they will be one hell of a company. With their competitors failing left and right and none finding the success as Rocket Lab‚Äîother than Space X‚Äîthey could stand to be a massive company in a few decades, so massive, they‚Äôre bigger than Earth.

One last financial point to touch upon‚Ä¶ shorting, so here is some data, which is roughly one month outdated due to my difficulty in finding up-to-date information on the company without a Bloomberg Terminal (So, if anyone on the sub has access to a Bloomberg Terminal and would like to add to my DD in the comments, please do).

**Last Record Date:** May 15, 2023

**Outstanding Shares:** 478,660,000 shares

**Float Size:** 262,310,000 shares

**Short Percent of Float:** 9.80% (The short percent of float represents the percentage of shares available for trading that have been sold short).

**Average Trading Volume:** 4,044,396 shares

**Current Short Volume:** 25,710,000 shares

**Previous Short Volume:** 24,630,000 shares

**Change Vs. Previous Month**: +4.38%

**Dollar Volume Sold Short:** $111.58 million

**Short Interest Ratio / Days to Cover:** 7.7 (This ratio indicates the number of days it would take for the short sellers to cover their positions based on the average daily trading volume.).

The short interest in Rocket Lab has increased from the previous month, with a change of +4.38%. The short percent of the float is 9.80%, indicating that a significant portion of the available shares for trading has been sold short. Now, Rocket Lab‚Äôs short interest is relatively low for a company that has had consistent negative EPS and revenue. Showcasing that the big players in markets either A) believe this company will make a massive turnaround in the near future (1-3 years mark) or B) Rocket Lab, due to its size, is thankfully not on their radar. However, that said, the off-exchange short percentage is 57.69%, showcasing that A) public on-exchange short volume is a complete hoax and Hedge Funds, and other big players are beating down on the stock or B) all of this information is completely misrepresented to retail traders on purpose and the entirety of the United States market system is a complete farce.

# Section 3: Future Prospects & Big Moves

Rocket Lab has demonstrated strong performance and growth potential in the emerging small satellite launch market. The company continues to refine its launch processes, aiming to increase launch frequency and reduce costs further. Additionally, Rocket Lab has plans to develop a larger reusable rocket called Neutron, targeting the medium-lift market segment, which would expand its capabilities and market reach. The company has the potential to be the go-to company for low Earth orbital launches in the short term and in the long term, one of, if not the go-to company, for transportation to the Moon, Mars, and Venus.

[  Peter Beck, founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, did an interview last month on his take on the industry and their future prospects. I wanted to touch briefly on this \(you can find the video on YouTube\).](https://preview.redd.it/ced7t9iivd4b1.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=6579fcd100b405f44d1e65fb13cb185cefe6ed76)

Firstly, the video begins with the commentator stating, ""*With the Space Race this week*,"" the Space X rocket, the most powerful ever built, has scrubbed its launch. While Rocket Lab is adding a new service for testing hypersonic sub-orbital launches, being a welcome addition to the company‚Äôs wide array of services. Beck states that it is a very exciting time, stating that ‚Äú*the United States is kind of lacking behind in hypersonic technologies and this is a great opportunity to have high cadence, test flight environment for these payloads to really move forward the US‚Äôs hypersonic research*.‚Äù He goes on to talk about how these capabilities are essentially repurposed from Rocket Lab‚Äôs Electron Rocket capabilities: ‚Äú*We take a standard Electron orbital-class launch vehicle and we fly it in some really unique trajectories to provide these hypersonic trajectories‚Ä¶ it is taking an Electron and making a couple wee tweaks to it and having a great high frequency hypersonic testing platform that hasn‚Äôt existed*.‚Äù Beck goes on to speak on the launch cadence ‚Äú*being on target for 15 flights*‚Äù this year with the fastest turn around this year being 7 days between flights, saying ‚Äú*the machine is cranking and the vehicles are flying successfully and the last flight was a reusable vehicle and we splashed that down successfully and now we‚Äôre kind at the point where we are recycling and harvesting engines and components off of those launch vehicles and getting ready to put them back into service and re-fly them*.‚Äù He continues, stating, ‚Äú*I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm allowed to say exactly, but‚Ä¶ a whole multiple gambit of reused components that are all now re-entering the production line and going back into service*.‚Äù Morgan Brennan, the interviewer then speaks to how there is this emerging mismatch between supply and demand when it comes to the satellite launch market, with the fact that there are so many satellite constellations that are poised to go into orbit in the coming years and not enough capacity in terms of launching them. So, she then asks about the reusability of Electron and the development of the Neutron. Beck states that, ‚Äú*Electron is really serving that market very well, and there are lots of flight opportunities that are sort of just doing its thing, Neutron is the new flight opportunity for us‚Ä¶ 2026 to 2030 timeframe there is a massive deficit in launch and there are lots of constellations that are all really vying for an ability to get in orbit, so we saw that coming and started work on the vehicle and hopefully we can bring it into service in 2024 and really solve some of those problems and take advantage of that market opportunity*.‚Äù

Now, I don‚Äôt have to tell you all that this is very good to hear from Beck and this is very exciting, showcasing that he really believes Rocket Lab can penetrate this market and become a big player in the ever-evolving industry.

**Rocket Lab Making Big Moves Lately:**

¬∑ Bought Virgin Orbit HQ in California, this was a big win for the company, and folk on the sub were very excited to see this happen. Yay! But, sad and unfortunate for Virgin Galactic, which I am sure many of us space enthusiasts had higher hopes for, oh well, not everyone can achieve their dreams.

¬∑ Rocket Lab reached a new Company record of nine launches within a calendar year.

¬∑ Achieved a record of 100% mission success for Electron launches for the year.

¬∑ Successfully launched CAPSTONE mission to the Moon for NASA, including the first demonstration of Lunar Photon spacecraft platform.

¬∑ Successfully deployed two satellites to space for NASA‚Äôs TROPICS mission on the first of two dedicated launches on Electron for the constellation scheduled in May 2023.

¬∑ Secured another NASA mission to Electron‚Äôs 2023 launch manifest with its Starling mission. Rocket Lab was selected by NASA to launch the Starling mission on an expedited timeline due to long delays and uncertainty with the mission‚Äôs original launch provider.

¬∑ Signed multiple new launch contracts on Electron for 2023 for undisclosed commercial satellite customers previously manifested on another small launch vehicle, demonstrating Electron‚Äôs strong position as a reliable and dependable ride to orbit for small satellite operators.

¬∑ Introduced Rocket Lab‚Äôs new HASTE launch vehicle, a suborbital testbed launch vehicle derived from the Company‚Äôs Electron rocket to provide reliable, high-cadence flight test opportunities to support the development of advanced hypersonic systems technology.

¬∑ Announced that the Company will fly a pre-launched 3D printed Rutherford engine on an upcoming mission in Q3‚Äô23, a major step in evolving the Electron launch vehicle into a reusable rocket.

¬∑ Delivered financial results that exceeded the high end of prior guidance for revenue and gross margin.

¬∑ Launched three successful Electron missions in the first quarter for commercial constellation operators HawkEye 360, Capella Space, and BlackSky.

¬∑ Successfully completed the Company‚Äôs first launch from its U.S. launch site, Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2, at the Virginia Spaceport Authority‚Äôs Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on January 24, 2023. The mission deployed three satellites for radio frequency geospatial analytics provider HawkEye 360.

¬∑ Successfully completed the Company‚Äôs fastest turnaround between launches to date ‚Äì just seven days between its 34th Electron launch, ‚ÄúStronger Together‚Äù, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 in Virginia on March 16, 2023, and its 35th Electron launch, ‚ÄúThe Beat Goes On‚Äù, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand on March 24, 2023.

¬∑ Rocket Lab remains the only U.S. commercial small launch provider to successfully deliver satellites to orbit in 2023. Secured a multi-mission contract with Capella Space to launch four more dedicated launches on Electron in 2023.

¬∑ Achieved programmatic milestones for the Company‚Äôs two Photon spacecraft to support NASA‚Äôs ESCAPADE mission to Mars, and for the Photon spacecraft for a Varda Space Industries‚Äô mission to manufacture high-value products in zero gravity. Both Photon programs include Rocket Lab star trackers, reaction wheels, solar panels, flight software, and radios ‚Äì demonstrating the value and strength of the Company‚Äôs vertical integration and in-house supply chain.

# Conclusion: An Ode to Humanity's Future

Rocket Lab has established itself as a leading player in the small satellite launch market, offering dedicated launch services tailored to the needs of small satellite operators. The company's technological capabilities, solid customer base, and innovative approach position it well for future growth.

Those who lived and grew up in the 1960s and 1970s believed that by the 21st century, mankind would be a space-faring civilization. People had a fascination with the unknown. It was embedded in pop culture, in movies like the 2001 Space Odyssey, Alien, and the Star Trek series. But the unfortunate truth is that after Apollo 17 on the 19th of December 1972, mankind has not left low-earth orbit. The American public lost interest, the government cut funding, and the Saturn V rockets were dismantled and replaced by space shuttles in the 1980s (spaceships not even built to leave low-earth orbit). The curiosity and desire to unravel the mystery of the universe are now again filling the hearts of people. Technology is becoming more advanced and cheaper.

With companies like Rocket Lab and Space X, the future is looking bright. We currently live in an era of mass information. One of the hardest aspects of life in the early-21st-century is learning how to filter all this information. The news of the accomplishments of Rocket Lab, Space X, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA), the European Space Agency (ESA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Space Force, are lost in the large volume of collective data. The average person does not believe how close we are to colonizing Luna and Mars; how close we are to becoming a multi-planetary species. If you walked up to someone on the street of New York City, today, and told them that in the mid-2040s, and by the latest, the 2050s, there will be hundreds if not thousands of people living in Earth's orbit, the upper atmosphere of Venus, the Moon, and Mars, the person would dismiss you in disbelief. But the same would have happened if you walked up to a person on the street of New York City on the 19th of July 1962 (before Kennedy‚Äôs speech) and told them that mankind would step foot on the moon in seven years. Companies like Rocket Lab, which will make orbital flight and transportation affordable, will allow for a new era of civilization, one which was only present and dreamed of in science fiction of the past.

[The Earth, as imaged from the Voyager 1 spacecraft, was suspended in a sunbeam, as the interstellar craft exited the Sol system in 1990. Earth is nearly 4 billion miles away in this image. That is us. That is humanity, all of us that have thus far, ever existed. We take to the stars in search of not only answers but in search of a purpose.](https://preview.redd.it/hnr23odlvd4b1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=298a1ee80b0bc5e3dc0ba5c3c61aa6a25c0682c1)

RocketLab_posts.csv,Neutron launching Kuiper Satellites for Amazon?,"Hi All,

I was thinking, what are the chances for Amazon awarding launch contract to RocketLab Neutron for its Kuiper Satellites?

RocketLab is already going to deliver reaction wheels (2-3K a year) for Kuiper. RocketLab also recently launched a high-volume star tracker (maybe also for Kuiper). All in all, seems like RocketLab is going to do a lot of work for Kuiper. Then why not launch also?

Amazon did sign launch contracts with Vulcan Centaur (ULA), New Glenn (BO) and Ariane 6 (ArianeSpace). All these medium to heavy lift launch vehicles are delayed and won't see a multiple launch cadence before 2025/2026. It is even questionable whether ULA and ArianeSpace can achieve a high launch cadence as their vehicles are expendable.

Amazon Kuiper is in a hurry to catch up with starlink, so they do not really have the luxury to wait. Therefore, I think there a good chances that RocketLab will get launch contracts from Amazon Kuiper. Neutron could potentially launch 4 or more times in 2025 and then scale rapidly from there i.e. providing Amazon Kuiper with better performance than all of the current launch contract holders.

A Neutron rocket could put roughly 18 Kuiper satellites (700kg per satellite) in orbit per launch at a price of $50 million. $ per kg will definitely be lower than with Vulcan Centaur and Ariane 6.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Speculation on the long-term evolution of commercial launch in this decade (with an eye towards heavy lift as well as Relativity Space),"Hey all,

Just thought I'd put this out there as purely hypothetical (borderline tinfoil) speculation on what could happen in the years to come as the commercial launch market continues to evolve.

First off, a fun thought exercise - what would you name a potential heavy-lift launch vehicle that Rocket Lab could develop after Neutron?

Peter Beck has mentioned recently that they have no plans on retreading the rocket development path, but if SpaceX manages to get the Starship system operational this decade and it disrupts the industry like everyone thinks it will, Rocket Lab may be forced to adapt once again.

In that case, after looking at a variety of options, I personally like Hadron^1 the most. It already has name recognition thanks to CERN's Large Hadron Collider. Additionally, the neutron itself is a member of the hadron class of subatomic particles.

So, not only would Hadron be a logical progression from a particle physics perspective, it would also have instant name recognition. Just imagine: ""Rocket Lab's Hadron Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle"" - rolls off the tongue rather nicely eh?

Second, I got to thinking about consolidation in the commercial launch sector moving forward, as an economic downturn looms and we exit the near-zero interest rate environment that led to the previous decade's boom in launch startups. Many executives in the industry ([including Beck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qcHd13G6yQ)) have made public statements about this in the past couple of years.

Other small launch newcomers already have strong ties to large defense primes that may suggest acquisition down the line (e.g. Lockheed Martin with ABL and Northrop Grumman with Firefly)

The only two remaining non-""billionaire funded"" U.S. commercial LV players with significant financial runways are Rocket Lab and Relativity Space.

I've read previous threads on this sub discussing Relativity and the sentiment seems to be that despite the fact that they've yet to launch, they are a competitor worth paying attention to due to significant private investor interest, high quality talent (mostly ex-SpaceX), and potentially game-changing proprietary tech.

Once again, if Starship proves to work as advertised, and/or macroeconomic conditions continue to deteriorate, market participants may be forced to consolidate in order to survive. Precedent is currently being set in the satellite operator space as multi-billion dollar players have begun M&A processes under growing pressure from Starlink (e.g. Oneweb / Eutelsat and Viasat / Inmarsat). While less common, we've also previously seen consolidation in the launch industry, with Lockheed + Boeing's ULA JV, Airbus + Safran's ArianeGroup JV, and Orbital + ATK's merger. Aerojet Rocketdyne's recent tie-ups with Northrop and L3Harris also come to mind. Granted, each of these cases is unique, but anything is possible in this space, regardless of how large or established a company is.

Thus, I see no inherent reason why a Rocket Lab + Relativity merger couldn't be possible down the line, assuming both companies continue to grow and execute at pace. (A major assumption, to be sure!)

I realize this is probably the last thing on either company's mind at the moment but hear me out. Below is a big picture list of observations on both companies, with an emphasis on their similarities and potential synergies:

- Co-location at NASA Stennis for both companies' next-generation reusable methalox engine testing: Both Aeon R and Archimedes test complexes will be located fairly close to each other at Stennis. I wouldn't be surprised to see some degree of cross-pollination between the construction, engineering, and technician staff across both programs
- Both companies are vocal champions of additive manufacturing techniques throughout major components of LV production
- Both companies' headquarters are located just 3 miles away from each other in Long Beach
- Rocket Lab has proven to be a pragmatic, execution-rich organization. Relativity has proven to be a forward-looking, ambition-rich organization. Combining these modalities could in theory lead to an organization greater than the sum of its parts - SpaceX, the current market leader, has both of these elements in spades
- With Neutron, Rocket Lab is optimizing for operational efficiency with partial reusability and RTLS as their north star, whereas with Terran-R, Relativity is leaning on highly novel structures with full reusability as their north star. If Relativity manages to crack the full reusability problem at sub-Starship scale,^2 both companies' tech could combine in a unique way for a joint RL/RS designed heavy lift vehicle (possibly the Hadron as spitballed above)
- Both companies have good design, PR, and marketing (see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2GT204CEVk), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aJ5NPt5fSM), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kwAPr5G6WA), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BhkjEc6Q64), and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Vf3MlbtAs)), which helps excite the general public and attract talent

Curious what everyone here thinks of both the HLV name brainstorm and a potential team-up with Relativity. Obviously there is an extremely low chance of either happening in this decade, but it's fun to think about as these companies race to develop vehicles that will ultimately launch next-gen constellations, commercial space stations, interplanetary missions, and much more.

Footnotes

1. Some alternatives: Graviton, Baryon, Fermion
2. Stoke Space's [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzqhZLgpiv0) also claims to have cracked the full-reusability problem but they are much earlier-stage and have less funding at this point in time. Definitely worth keeping an eye on though.

Today an article just came out on [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/the-gold-rush-for-the-next-round-of-military-launch-contracts-has-started/) with the following quote that piqued my interest:

RocketLab_posts.csv,"With Starshield, SpaceX readies for battle","PURSUIT OF DEFENSE DOLLARS
What SpaceX has done with Starlink is to visibly demonstrate how commercial space technology serves national security applications, said Peter Arment, aerospace and defense industry analyst at Baird investment bank.

‚ÄúThis helps SpaceX obviously but also helps the entire industry attract investment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe defense spending space is sort of a rising tide at the moment.‚Äù

Before anyone had ever heard of Starshield, other companies in the space industry started making moves to be better positioned to compete in the national security arena.

Commercial launch provider and satellite manufacturer Rocket Lab on Dec. 1 announced it is establishing a U.S.-based subsidiary for defense and intelligence work, including classified programs.

The new business, called Rocket Lab National Security, will have ‚Äúclose engagement with U.S. government customers to understand their mission requirements, which may be dedicated rapid call-up launch, satellite design, build and integration, spacecraft operations or all of the above,‚Äù Rocket Lab spokesperson Murielle Baker said in a statement.

Tess Hatch, vice president of Bessemer Venture Partners, a Rocket Lab investor, said the mood has shifted from a year ago ‚Äúwhen investors in boardrooms were pounding our fists on the table saying ‚Äògrowth at all cost.‚Äô‚Äù Defense customers can be ‚Äúa little lumpy and unpredictable. However, there are massive potential contracts,‚Äù Hatch said Dec. 6 at the TechCrunch Space conference.

‚ÄúWith markets down and maybe commercial needing to push a little more throttle, the diversity of the customer base is so important,‚Äù Hatch said. ‚ÄúThe government is extra helpful for space companies right now when the commercial side isn‚Äôt as efficient.‚Äù",27,3,https://spacenews.com/with-starshield-spacex-readies-for-battle/,0.9919,0.171,0.812,0.016

Electron will deploy three satellites for radio frequency
geospatial analytics provider HawkEye 360. The
mission will be the first of three Electron launches for
HawkEye 360 in a contract that will see Rocket Lab
deliver 15 satellites to low Earth orbit between late
2022 and 2024. These missions will grow HawkEye
360‚Äôs constellation of radio frequency monitoring
satellites, enabling the company to better deliver
precise mapping of radio frequency emissions
anywhere in the world.

Earlier this year, Rocket Lab managed to [succesfully re-ignite a first stage engine](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/01/rocket-lab-fires-up-its-first-recovered-engine-on-track-to-full-booster-reusability/) after it was retrieved from the ocean. This suggests that air captures may in fact be unnecessary and instead of further promoting the company to investors, it is actually acheiving the opposite effect due to the [negative media coverage](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/04/business/rocket-lab-helicopter-booster-catch-scn/index.html). My personal recommednation would be to cancel the air-capture attempts and retreive all future booster stages from the ocean using the retreival vessel. This avoids putting lives at undue risk for publicity purposes while still enabling the company to re-use the first stage engines. The helicopters can be re-tasked to spot the landing locations of the booster stages for the retrieval vessel.",0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/yme706/time_for_rocket_lab_to_reconsider_aircaptures/,-0.8582,0.016,0.9,0.084

[](/# MC // section mission)
# Primary Mission: Deployment of payload into correct orbit

Electron will carry a science research satellite by
space systems provider OHB Sweden for the Swedish
National Space Agency (SNSA). The Mesospheric
Airglow/Aerosol Tomography and Spectroscopy
(MATS) satellite is the basis for the SNSA‚Äôs science
mission to investigate atmospheric waves and
better understand how the upper layer of Earth‚Äôs
atmosphere interacts with wind and weather patterns
closer to the ground. MATS was originally due to fly
on a Russian launch service before the mission was
manifested on Rocket Lab‚Äôs Electron.


The Swedish National Space Agency, SNSA, is a central
governmental agency under the Ministry of Education
and Research. SNSA is responsible for national and
international activities relating to space and remote
sensing, primarily research and development.
The mission‚Äôs science partner is the Department of
Meteorology at Stockholm University (MISU).

[](/# MC // section landing)
# Recovery Attempt

Using a modified Sikorsky S-92 large helicopter, Rocket
Lab will attempt to capture the Electron rocket‚Äôs first
stage mid-air as it returns from space after launch.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Why use and Oxygen Rich Closed Cycle on Archimedes and not a Fuel Rich Closed Cycle?,Anyone understand why RocketLab hasn't used a fuel rich staged combustion cycle for their new Archimedes engine but is going with Oxygen rich?  From my very limited understanding (Everyday Astronaut school of Rocket Engine Cycles) is seems like once the fuel is CH and not RP1 the coking problems for a fuel rich pre burner disappear.  This problem must have been solved by SpaceX for their CH fuel rich pre burner on the Raptor.  But it seems that one of the big challenges for Raptor was SpaceX developing a new alloy for their O2 rich pre burner for Raptor.  Is RocketLab working on new alloys for this or has rocket engine metallurgy moved on since the start of Raptor development?,39,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xvqw1q/why_use_and_oxygen_rich_closed_cycle_on/,0.9681,0.205,0.716,0.078

RocketLab_posts.csv,"~600 kg, RTLS, multi-core, Electron++ ?","~600 kg to LEO, RTLS, multi-core, Electron++ ?

 &nbsp;

**Rationale**

* Competitors are aiming for this payload class, Astra, Virgin Orbit, Firefly (1,000 kg), Terra 1 (1,500 kg)  
* MDA, with RocketLab, is building 500 kg satellites, could be launched by RL  
* Gain RTLS [propulsive landing] experience  
* Gain landing leg experience  
* Gain relight experience 
* Retain staff building rockets for potentially more customers
* Use returned boosters to increase launch cadence


 &nbsp;

**Proposing**  

* Triple booster first stage, no staging  
* Double second-stage or single extended  
* Landing legs for RTLS  
* Maybe larger fairing with dual second stage with interstage  


 &nbsp;

**Possible configuration**  

* Triangle configuration of boosters (no staging), with landing legs, nosecone on one of the boosters  
* Inline configuration of two second stages (no staging) mounted on two of the boosters
* 1 m  or 2 m fairing (which would require new molds) plus funky interstage


 &nbsp;

**Discussion:**  

* A triple booster should have enough reserve propellant and thrust to lift the RTLS propellant, legs and account for extra drag.  Either triple-engine landing or dual-engine landing possibilities (depending on landing mass).  
* A dual booster would mean unmodified second stages fastened together, provide thrust needed for up to 600 kg to LEO.  
* A payload interstage would be needed.  
* Could call it Anion (extra electrons)",0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xt9yt3/600_kg_rtls_multicore_electron/,0.7269,0.065,0.889,0.046

RocketLab_posts.csv,RocketLab Capsule,"Rocket Lab, during the investor day, presented some illustrations for a human capsule for Neutron. While presenting, the company was very clear that this was not a capsule announcement but they are looking into the topic.

However, what is interesting is the size of the capsule presented with a human for scale. (Another member made a post on how much bigger the capsule is relative to Dragon from SpaceX).

To investigate whether the illustration was a mistake, I did some digging using the 2nd illustration of the capsule with a docking station. I utilized the docking station as a measurement foundation and compared the illustration with a relatively similar picture of a Dragon with a docking station. Here is what I found (rough measurements).

1. RocketLab's capsule is rougly 2.6 times the diameter of the docking station.
2. Dragon is rought 1.8 times the diameter of the docking station.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

1. It seems like that RKLB did not make a mistake when they showed a human for scale. RKLB may indeed be planning a much bigger capsule than Dragon and Starliner. (RKLB rarely makes mistakes on slides and it would be unlikely they made the size mistake on two slides)

Counter-argument; Dragon and Starliner are rougly 12 tonnes. Neutron in expendable mode can deliver 13 tonnes to LEO. Therefore it would be unlikely that they are planning a larger capsule.

Counter-counter argument:

1. RKLB is known for innovation and it is likely that they with the technology of 2025-2026 could develop a much lighter capsule
2. Neutron's performance metrics are based on the rocket performing in a chill mode. More performance could be achieved by pushing the engines to near their limit. i.e. Neutron if need be could potentially deliver +20 tonnes to LEO.

Let me know what you think?

&#x200B;

Update:

ISS docking station actual diameter: 2.4 meters

Estimated dragon diameter: 4.3 (actual 4) meters

Estimated RKLB capsule diameter: 6.2 meters

RocketLab_posts.csv,Rocket Lab will design its own crewed spacecraft?,"It seems that yes

(NOTE: Although some say that Rocket Lab does not intend to design a manned capsule, but will only have human qualification, the reality is that Peter Beck talked about a manned vehicle, and what the safety systems would be like, he said they would remove the fairing from the vehicle).

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcuOSXjevGs&t=2337s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcuOSXjevGs&t=2337s)

&#x200B;

I will now explain why I believe Rocket Lab will design its own manned spacecraft, and will not use Soyuz spacecraft.

&#x200B;

\-Rocket Lab has recently announced that they plan to deliver cargo around the world, (sort of like E2E).

So obviously they will design a re-entry vehicle...then they could adapt it for the manned missions they have announced.

\-If Rocket Lab were to buy a Soyuz capsule, they would be using Russian technology... and there are problems with Russia.

They would also be wasting money if in the future they want to build their own capsule....

And there are many other factors...

\-The Starliner can't be launched on Neutron in the reusable version, and besides, the starliner doesn't even work lol....

\-In the future there will be several space stations, and RL will not be left behind.

Also, for now Europe doesn't have its own spacecraft, the Susie spacecraft is under development, and according to what ArianeGroup has announced, operational flights will arrive in 2030.

So RL could develop a capsule or support body to sell seats to Europe.

\-The small spacecraft could also serve as a reusable second stage and RL would have a fully reusable multipurpose vehicle.",45,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xivd25/rocket_lab_will_design_its_own_crewed_spacecraft/,0.6594,0.062,0.895,0.043

The company also [over-estimated demand for the small launch industry](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/peter-beck-explains-why-electron-may-only-ever-launch-10-15-times-a-year/) and thus is producing Electron rockets at a faster rate than they are being used. Therefore, re-usability currently serves no purpose other than to boost the company's reputation. I suspect they also do not want another failed catch as this could damage the company's reputation and leed to a loss of confidence amoung investors.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5DdP9uvkEs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5DdP9uvkEs)

This will surely be a Killer App for SpaceX's upcoming Starship launch vehicle, deploying their upcoming Starlink v2 satellites into orbit. There will surely be a demand for this type of communication network if it works as advertised, fulfilling the promise of what Iridium was supposed to be.

I was wondering whether Rocket Lab with its own in-house expertise from its family of satellite component builders might be able to come up with a comparable solution as this. Something like that would surely create demand for Neutron's launch services, especially with the rapid launch turnaround Neutron is meant for.

So Neutron obviously won't have a fairing as large as Starship's, but could some of the well-known origami techniques be used to create large unfolding antenna arrays that could snugly fit into Neutron's payload fairing for launch? Elon Musk said Starlink v2 would be using the world's most advanced Phased Array antennae, which could both detect the comparatively weaker signals from cellphones and compensate for Doppler frequency shift. Is anything like that within the capabilities of Rocket Lab or its family of subsidiary companies?

Surely a globe-spanning mobile cellular telecom network would be the ultimate demand-driver for the kind of launch cadence Neutron aspires to.",28,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wzw1lb/can_rocket_lab_replicate_starlinktmobile/,0.9614,0.132,0.832,0.037

RocketLab_posts.csv,"Rocket Lab's path to Profitability: Increasing SolAero Gross Margins, Electron Recovery, and Responsive Launches","In Rocket Lab's [earnings call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE) yesterday, they made some very interesting statements about how the company plans to increase gross margins and achieve profitability.

First, Rocket Lab [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE&t=2622s) that increasing gross margin on AolAero is the best thing that they can do to improve profitability on the Space Systems side. Rocket Lab said that they have a 24 month plan to increase SolAero gross margins from ""high single digits"" to a whopping 30%! They said that they are very confident in this plan, and that executing on it is only a matter of time. Rocket Lab said that revenue from the acquired companies SolAero, Advanced Solutions Inc, and Planetary Systems Corporation was $28M in Q2 2022, and the vast majority (> $20M?) was from SolAero. Therefore, increasing the gross margin to 30% on SolAero revenue is a really big deal!

Secondly, Rocket Lab [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE&t=3102s) that for their new [Responsive Space Program](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-introduces-responsive-space-program/), the cost per launch is 15-30% higher than the typical Electron launch price of $7.5M, and the vast majority of that 15-30% markup goes directly to gross margin since most of their launch costs are fixed costs. Between Electron reuse (70% of cost is in the first stage) and responsive launches, I see a clear path to increasing the gross margins of Electron!

These statements really help to paint a clear path to profitability in my mind. With stronger than expected revenues and a clear path to profitability, it‚Äôs no wonder that Rocket Lab stock surged over 20% today. What do you guys think? What do you think Rocket Lab's plans for SolAero are? Increasing automation? Integration of solar panels into other components? Outsourcing of manufacturing? I sure hope it isn‚Äôt outsourcing, the United States really needs to manufacture its own solar panels.",73,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wmsfbg/rocket_labs_path_to_profitability_increasing/,0.9784,0.17,0.755,0.075

RocketLab_posts.csv,"My gut feeling: Solaero acquisition was a mistake, and perhaps a very bad one","I expressed a lot of concerns back in December about that acquisition:
 - 5 % gross margins: there is not really any cost savings with this acquisition. Why not just buy the solar panels directly from a third party, just like I assume spaceX does??? SpaceX doesn‚Äôt seem to have any issues sourcing solar panels!
 - Massive 60 % expansion of headcount at rocketlab
 - Rocketlab has 0 experience in solar panels construction
 - Massive distraction on top of the many challenges the company already faces 

To the list above we can now 
 - add a massive market meltdown
 - runaway inflation, which likely is going to be a big deal when selling something manufacturing intensive with 5 % gross margin

Was this acquisition motivated by the revenue increase from the low margin solar panels? I sincerely hope not. Because here‚Äôs the deal: most investors don‚Äôt give any multiple multiple to this.

I listened to the earning call today‚Ä¶ and I can‚Äôt help but feel that my concerns were warranted. Very negative contribution to gross margins.

It seems from this that Rocket Lab has already missed out on a number of cruicial launch contracts from the commercial space sector. Though they have been recognised by the U.S Space Force and with their recent Electron launches for the NRO, it is possible that Neutron may be selected as the go-to for the defense sector in the United States.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Rocket Lab generating negative revenue on Electron Launches?,"Hey, so I'm part of a small investor group on Discord which follows space stocks. Recently one of our members [revealed that Rocket Lab is operating electron launches at a net loss](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/998003492503421018/1005151082512662588/IMG_0619.png?width=1200&height=301). He came to this conclusion after digging around in the quarterly earnings reports which report revenues and expenses related to launches and then counted the number of launches in that quarter by referring to Rocket Lab's [completed missions](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/) page. Now obviously, this may not be entirely unexpected for a company that is still relatively new. However, I find the lack of transparency regarding this issue concerning. Investors should not have to go to this level of detail just to uncover that a company is generating negative returns on launches. Obviously, they are generaing revenues from their subsidiary companies as well as the sales of [reaction wheels](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/space-systems/satellite-components/reaction-wheels/) and [star trackers](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/space-systems/satellite-components/star-trackers/). Hopefully, as launch cadence improves and re-usability becomes more streamlined, the company may end up breaking even. Don't get me wrong, I love what Rocket Lab does (it's amazing), but I just feel a little.. annoyed that Peter Beck hasn't stated that they are generating negative revenues from the launches.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Is Relativity Space overpromising?,"I acknowledge that this is a bit of a rhetorical question, because RS hasn't launched yet, but that's kind of the point. They haven't launched Terran 1 yet, but they've announced plans with insane deadlines to send a second generation launch vehicle that's going to be as big as Starship to Mars (and beat SpaceX there, no less). Somehow, even though they haven't launched anything, they have enormous amounts of funding and a [pad at Cape Canaveral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_Space#Cape_Canaveral_LC-16). They will be having the [first launch](https://www.spacelaunchschedule.com/launch/terran-1-maiden-flight/) of Terran 1 later this month.

Full admission, I'm biased against RS because I'm invested in RKLB, and RS is a private company which us retail investors aren't able to invest in. If RS is as good as they claim to be, then they would obviously be a threat to RKLB, which until now, has been second best next to SpaceX, and the best space launch investment option on the public markets by far.

At the same time, I see the wild claims that RS makes, and it makes my bullshit detector want to go off. Sure, RS has cool 3D printing tech, but does that really qualify them as rocket designers? Rocket engineering is notoriously hard. Announcing ambitious plans and timelines for a second generation vehicle when you haven't even launched one of your first generation vehicles reeks both of arrogance and of inexperience. It seems pretty obvious that they will want to make many changes to the design of their vehicles and iterate.

Technology wise, I get that they have a cool metal 3D printer, but it makes me cringe every time I hear them say that their technology is powered by ""AI"". To me, that says that the company is relying on buzzwords to lure naive investors that have no understanding of the technology involved. We also know that their rocket is not, in fact, fully 3D printed. I personally doubt that their construction method is particularly cost-effective, but that remains to be seen.

This last point is debatable, but I also feel like the relatively large size of the Terran 1 rocket is an error. It's a fairly large two-stage vehicle. If you've ever used a 3D printer, you know that the time needed to print something increases rapidly with the size of the object. Having a large rocket means that your prints take much longer, which in turn means that you iterate quite a bit slower. RS could have chosen to start by printing a smaller suborbital rocket so they can really test their technology, iterate rapidly on design changes, and then go for an orbital vehicle when they have more experience. Instead they're directly going for a large two-stage rocket and trying to launch it to orbit. If they need to iterate on this, it will take longer and be more costly.

RS is having their first launch later this month. Maybe they'll succeed and we'll all be really impressed that they've nailed it on their first try. Or maybe Terran 1 will blow up, there will be months of delays after that, and we'll eventually find out that RS has more in common with Nikola than SpaceX.",42,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wiex5n/is_relativity_space_overpromising/,0.9524,0.099,0.823,0.078

Personally, I think Astra will go bankrupt before Rocket 4 is ready. The issue is that Astra is burning through their cash at a rate of $85M per quarter, have zero revenue, and have only $200M in cash left. I don‚Äôt see any good way for Astra to raise more money, either. At the time of this posting, Astra has a $343.40M market cap, which shows that most of the value of the company is just that $200M pile of cash. Once that cash is gone, so is their market cap and their ability to raise more capital.

In their earnings call yesterday, Astra also said that Rocket 3 was not a commercially viable product, and even if it did work reliably, there were simply not enough interested customers for it to be successful. Apparently satellites are growing in size and customers want larger rockets like Terran R, as evidenced by Relativity Space‚Äôs ridiculous [$1.2B backlog](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/30/relativity-space-inks-deal-with-oneweb-reaches-1-2b-in-terran-r-launch-contracts/).

I wonder what this means for Rocket Lab and the future of Electron? In my opinion, it looks like Electron might be the only smallsat launcher left standing. There is little incentive for anyone else to develop a competitor for Electron since it seems that rockets of this size are not commercially viable. But there is a silver lining. Rocket Lab is at least able to mostly break even on their Electron launches. This gives them an extremely cost effective R&D testbed to develop the technology they need for Neutron. Electron also gives Rocket Lab publicity and helps them to build up launch heritage and relationships with customers.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Did Rocket Lab take inspiration from Pioneer 13 for it's Venus Mission?,"Pioneer 13, also known as Pioneer Venus 2, was a mission carried out by NASA as part of their Pioneer Program which involved sending a range of probes to various objects within the solar system. The design chosen by Rocket Lab has quite a few distinct similarities' to the Pioneer Venus 2 but also a couple noticeable differences. One of the similarities is the design of the probe capsule, which is almost identical in shape. The shape of the spacecraft are also fairly similar with the noticeable difference being that Rocket Lab's design places the solar panels on top of the craft, not the sides. Curious to know what other people think about this.

Electron's 27th launch from New Zealand.
==========
Stage 1&2 success. 
==========
Quick Facts:

**Lift-off is scheduled for 0955 UTC from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 Pad B.**

Rocket Lab is launching: 
""Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment, also known as CAPSTONE.""


This pathfinding 55-pound CubeSat, will be the first spacecraft to test the Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) around
the Moon.

Researchers expect this orbit to be a gravitational
sweet spot in space ‚Äì where the pull of gravity from
Earth and the Moon interact to allow for a nearly stable orbit.

The orbit will bring CAPSTONE within 1,000 miles
of one lunar pole on its near pass and 43,500
miles from the other pole at its peak every seven
days, requiring less propulsion capability for
spacecraft flying to and from the Moon‚Äôs surface
than other circular orbits.

CAPSTONE is expected to orbit this area around
the Moon for at least six months to understand the
characteristics of the orbit. The NRHO
provides the advantage of an unobstructed view of
Earth in addition to coverage of the lunar South Pole.

RocketLab_posts.csv,The Rocket Lab Analysis (RKLB),"This post explains why Rocket Lab is at its current price one of the greatest investments you can make and why I‚Äôve personally invested my life savings in it. Note, this is not financial advice, I am an ape and a moron.üçå

**Intro.**

Rocket Lab is a rocket company that is working on building a reusable medium lift rocket. They currently have a small rocket (Electron Rocket) and have had over 20+ successful launches to orbit and have deployed over 100 satellites.

The company just received funding via SPAC to go public to fund development of its new medium lift rocket (Neutron Rocket) which is expected to complete by 2024. There is only one company that has successfully accomplished substantial reusability of such a rocket which is SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 rocket.

**Why is reusability so important for a rocket?**

Most rockets today launch and the entire rocket gets destroyed. Imagine if a Boeing 747 airliner had to be destroyed after every flight, each ticket would be over a million dollars a flight for them to make a profit, this is basically what we do with modern rockets. Make that 747 rapidly reusable again and again, and the cost drops dramatically. NASA attempted to do this with the Space Shuttle program because of the insane costs of the Saturn V (Moon rocket) but failed because of large scale refurbishment needs. Today however, SpaceX has shown proof that it is possible with their Falcon 9 and many companies are working on following.

**Competitor Analysis**

**Astra** ‚Äì Lead by Chris Kemp does show promise, however by 8/2021, 4 of their first launches failed (Rocket 1, Rocket 2, Rocket 3.0, Rocket 3.1) with only their 5th rocket making it to to space but still failing to reach stable orbit in December of 2020 (Rocket 3.2). Astra will undoubtedly be a big player one day; however, they are currently far behind Rocket Lab and eons behind SpaceX, therefore they are no threat. (2021 Estimated 100 employees, mrkt cap \~2.5B)

**Relativity Space** ‚Äì This newer space company has two rocket designs:

Terran 1 is an expendable small sat vehicle which is expected to launch in 2022, no threat.

Terran R is a medium/large class rocket designed to be reusable which poses a direct threat and is expected to make first orbital launch by 2024. 

Relativity Space has yet to achieve orbit, and while their plans are big, they have yet to prove their capabilities. Talk is cheap in this game, it doesn‚Äôt matter how much funding you have, achieving orbit is incredibility difficult. While they are somewhat a threat, I have no doubt that RKLB will beat them to a reusable medium class rocket by many years. (2021 estimated 400 employees, mrkt cap \~4.2B Private)

**Firefly Aerospace** ‚Äì This is another early space vehicle developer which has a few vehicles.

Firefly Alpha ‚Äì Expendable small sat vehicle, has many similarities to the RKLBs Electron rocket, as of 8/2021 it has yet to launch with the first planned launch by 9/2021. As a small sat non reusable vehicle this is of no threat.

Firefly Beta ‚Äì Essentially a scaled up Alpha medium class rocket planned to launch in 2024, it doesn‚Äôt appear to have reusability designed in but they are boasting to have the lowest cost 8000kg LEO delivery vehicle. No threat, the future of space is reusable not expendable, we‚Äôll see how that goes with an expendable design.

Firefly Gamma ‚Äì 2 Stage medium class rocket designed to have the first stage reusable. Highly similar design as a Falcon 9 or the Neutron Rocket and a direct competitor. Planned test flights to start in 2024-2025. 

While the Gamma vehicle is a direct threat, Firefly has yet to achieve orbit with any of their vehicles. Their funding is dismal and they are spreading their R&D over multiple vehicles which will strain their resources greatly. They should probably scrap their Beta project and go straight to Gamma, regardless, on their current course RKLB will beat them by many years even though they are estimating completion at around the same time as neutron. (2021 Estimated 350 employees, mrkt cap \~500M Private)

**Virgin Galactic and Virgin Orbit** \- Excluding Virgins Galactics commercial tourism vehicle, Virgin Orbit has a small sat deployment rocket which launches off an aircraft at high altitude. This was recently announced to go public via SPAC. This is a non-reusable rocket and poses no threat as an expendable small rocket, they will need to switch to a ground launch vehicle if they plan on designing any larger vehicles that would be considered competition. Virgin Galactics space tourism vehicle is another market entirely and also poses no threat.

**SpaceX** ‚Äì SpaceX is the king of the jungle and king of agile development; they have proven the proof of concept and essentially hold the golden standard with their Falcon 9 that RKLB and all the other companies are pushing to match. They currently have the only reusable vehicle in the market and their costs are a fraction of their current expendable vehicle competitors. SpaceX has since stopped upgrades with the Falcon 9 and focused all of their efforts on their new super heavy class vehicle the Starship. The Falcon 9 is a direct competitor however there is enough room in space for two, Elon has shown interest in the Neutron Rocket and Peter Beck and seems to be supportive and sees the value in competition, mainly since he probably sees them as a little brother. Therefore, unless SpaceX decides to become extremely competitive with the Falcon 9 to specifically spite RKLB‚Ä¶ unlikely, they shouldn‚Äôt be a huge threat. The Falcon 9 will no doubt remain #1 for medium/heavy rockets and take the best contracts, but there is enough room for the Neutron Rocket to get some of the market share.

The main concern here is the Starship. A new fully reusable super heavy class vehicle with its maiden flight coming up fast, it could likely start launching satellites as early as next year. Will a fully reusable super heavy class vehicle swoop up all the planetary demand for launch vehicles and hurt Rocket Lab? It might drive down costs, but I think there is plenty of backlog and demand for a superheavy class vehicle to not be as much of a burden. (2021 Estimated 9500 employees, mrkt cap ~75B private)

**Blue Origin** ‚Äì Amazons Jeff Bezos company is also exploring reusable rockets.

The famous phallic New Shepard rocket is essentially a suborbital vehicle which is incapable of deploying satellites or making it to orbit. 

New Glenn ‚Äì This vehicle is a superheavy class fully reusable vehicle in similar competition with SpaceX‚Äôs starship, expected to launch in 2022. There have yet to be any flight tests, so this timeline will likely be pushed to 2023 and beyond.

Blue Origin has been working with much secrecy until now with their new developments so it is difficult to accurately gauge their effectiveness. Regardless, if they are successful the New Glenn could pose to be a major threat. Jeff Bezos has been publishing many hate articles bad mouthing SpaceX and while their tech currently sucks, it is no doubt that if they make a reusable vehicle, they will be a cancerous and below the belt fighting competition. Jeff has enough money himself to bankroll the operation through development no matter how long it takes, and could even theoretically buy out RKLB in its entirety himself, so Blue Origin remains a threat, only time will tell how serious of a threat they will be.

**Others** \- One odd reality with the big prime contractors and government bodies like Lockheed Martin / Boeing (ULA), NASA and others, is that they are not pursuing reusable vehicles, as clear as it is and how profitable it will be, they have made ZERO attempt to pursue this path. Mainly because it is incredibly expensive, takes many years to see a return on investment, and is incredibility difficult to even achieve. They are likely too large, led by corporate goons with no vision. One reality is certain, short of discovering anti-gravity technology, reusable rockets are without a doubt, the future of space travel.

**Rocket Lab Pros**

Rocket Lab currently holds the second most frequentlu annually launched vehicle in the US (Electron Rocket) with over 20 launches as of 8/2021. They have proven their capabilities and ability to achieve orbit and their agile development with minimal funding and personnel.

They have enough money from the SPAC to develop the Neutron Rocket and still hold many shares should they need more in the future.

Proof of concept has been established with SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9; all they need to do is copy that.

They are led by a hands-on engineer who developed rockets, seems to have a great vision, and doesn‚Äôt appear to be a sellout. Very Elon Muskesque. 

Finally, they have enough name recognition to attract enough talent in the industry to pull in new employees to help develop their new vehicle. 

SpaceX had 4 failures and 1 successful small vehicle launch (Falcon 1) before beginning to develop the Falcon 9, with no name recognition, no proof of concept, and no commercialization of space. Rocket Lab has a thousand times more advantage than they did at the time. No other company is in a better position to design a medium class reusable rocket than Rocket Lab is today.

Photon - Rocket Lab also has a customizable universal satellite system called Photon. This satellite can be customized to any customers needs. The main advantage of this is that many customers are searching for a one stop solution, they don't necessarily want to develop satellites especially if they have never done so in the past, it's likely much cheaper for most companies to pay a well proven vehicle that can be customized to their needs, placed in an orbit they need, and collect the data that they need. Photon and systems alike will make it much easier and cheaper for companies to buy and deploy satellites and you could even theoretically argue a rental model for the future for more common orbits and purposes. My personal concern is the barriers for entry for a system like Photon is much easier (still extremely difficult) to develop than a launch vehicle itself, there are already many companies who have specialized and designed their own satellites who could pivot into this market which could make competition difficult, therefore I focused this post on the ground to space transport system.

**Conclusion**

Based on the above, Rocket Lab is essentially the #1 public company to invest in, that will reach market the quickest and has the best odds. That along with the potential Space Boom and Space Bubble that is yet to come shows that RKLB is an absolute great investment right now for a 10‚Äì20-year investment. With enough hype, it could 10-20x within a year or two. Again, this is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor, I am a moron and an ape, and a man who loves aerospace.

###Launch window:

The 10-day launch window opens on Saturday 20^th January 2018, NZST. During this time a four-hour launch window will open daily from 2:30 p.m. NZDT (0130 UTC).

The test launch attempt will only proceed if conditions are ideal for launch. Due to the nature of launching rockets, planned lift-offs are often subject to multiple and subsequent postponements, or scrubs, to allow for small, technical modifications and to wait for ideal weather conditions.

RocketLab_posts.csv,"So now that Astra won‚Äôt be launching anything until probably 2024, what does this mean for Rocket Lab?","Astra has [cancelled](https://spacenews.com/astra-cancels-rocket-3-to-focus-on-larger-vehicle/) the Rocket 3 program and says they won‚Äôt launch any customer payloads until around 2024 when Rocket 4 is ready. Personally, I think Astra will go bankrupt before Rocket 4 is ready. The issue is that Astra is burning through their cash at a rate of $85M per quarter, have zero revenue, and have only $200M in cash left. I don‚Äôt see any good way for Astra to raise more money, either. At the time of this posting, Astra has a $343.40M market cap, which shows that most of the value of the company is just that $200M pile of cash. Once that cash is gone, so is their market cap and their ability to raise more capital.

In their earnings call yesterday, Astra also said that Rocket 3 was not a commercially viable product, and even if it did work reliably, there were simply not enough interested customers for it to be successful. Apparently satellites are growing in size and customers want larger rockets like Terran R, as evidenced by Relativity Space‚Äôs ridiculous [$1.2B backlog](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/30/relativity-space-inks-deal-with-oneweb-reaches-1-2b-in-terran-r-launch-contracts/).

I wonder what this means for Rocket Lab and the future of Electron? In my opinion, it looks like Electron might be the only smallsat launcher left standing. There is little incentive for anyone else to develop a competitor for Electron since it seems that rockets of this size are not commercially viable. But there is a silver lining. Rocket Lab is at least able to mostly break even on their Electron launches. This gives them an extremely cost effective R&D testbed to develop the technology they need for Neutron. Electron also gives Rocket Lab publicity and helps them to build up launch heritage and relationships with customers.

RocketLab_posts.csv,"For the humor of it: in theory, could the Electron launch a single reckless astronaut to the ISS?","This is very much a silly question, but given that the Electron has a payload capacity of up to 300kg, I've been wondering if it would in theory be possible for one single daredevil astronaut to sit inside the fairing, wearing a lightweight space suit, and hitch a ride up to the ISS.

This obviously leaves very little weight for things like docking thrusters, so I guess the second stage would have to make it all the way to the ISS along with our astronaut and match its speed and position with the ISS as closely as possible. We'd probably have to hope that this ride would be relatively quick as well (max 6-8 hours?) given that the only oxygen reserves would be in the spacesuit itself.

For shielding from vibrations during launch, we'll assume that our astronaut is surrounded by or sitting on some kind of lightweight foam. Not sure how they would transfer from the second stage of the rocket to the ISS when they get there. Ideally the second stage would get very close and they could just manually grab onto it and make their way to the airlock. Elevator music would be played through the spacesuit's comm system during the ascent.

I hope nobody gets mad at me for posting this, I just thought it would be funny to entertain the idea.",112,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/qbfatp/for_the_humor_of_it_in_theory_could_the_electron/,0.9743,0.13,0.837,0.033

RocketLab_posts.csv,Relative Valuations of Rocket Lab and Closest Competitors,"The biggest knock I hear against Rocket Lab is its valuation. So, I decided to look up the valuation of Rocket Lab's closest competitors. Here is what I found:

&#x200B;

**Firefly Aerospace**: $1B valuation,  launching orbital test flight later this yr. No commercial launches. (Alpha: 1000 kg to LEO)    [https://www.rocketlaunchschedule.com/firefly-aerospace-firefly-alpha-maiden-flight/](https://www.rocketlaunchschedule.com/firefly-aerospace-firefly-alpha-maiden-flight/)

&#x200B;

**ABL Space Systems**: $1.3B valuation, launching orbital test flight later this yr. (RS1: 1350 kg to LEO)   

[https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/05/abl-joining-market-growing-contracts/](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/05/abl-joining-market-growing-contracts/)  

&#x200B;

**Astra Space**: $2.1B valuation, launching first orbital flight with USSF test payload this month (Aug. 27th). (500 kg to LEO)   [https://www.space.com/astra-launch-space-force-satellite-this-month](https://www.space.com/astra-launch-space-force-satellite-this-month) 

&#x200B;

**Virgin Orbit**: $3B valuation, two successful commercial launches to orbit. (Launcher One: 500 kg to LEO)  [https://www.space.com/virgin-orbit-launch-seven-satellies](https://www.space.com/virgin-orbit-launch-seven-satellies) 

&#x200B;

**Rocket Lab**: $4.1B valuation (post-merger), 17 successful orbital launches, 105 satellites placed in orbit, 3 more missions in Aug-Sept., NASA moon mission in Q4 2021, burgeoning space systems business, and 8000 kg payload Neutron launching in 2024. (Electron: 300 kg to LEO)  [https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/) 

&#x200B;

**Relativity Space**: $4.2B valuation, launching first orbital test flight this yr. (Terran 1: 1250 kg to LEO)  [https://www.reuters.com/technology/relativity-space-raises-650-mln-bigger-3d-printed-rocket-2021-06-08/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/relativity-space-raises-650-mln-bigger-3d-printed-rocket-2021-06-08/)  

&#x200B;

The point being, developing a successful rocket company is damn hard and many have closed up shop trying. What SpaceX has done to initiate this ""new space"" race is remarkable. What Peter Beck has done with Rocket Lab is also pretty damn remarkable considering where he came from and the fact that New Zealand had no space industry really to speak of.   

Investors are going to have to pay a premium to invest in a rocket company that is currently successful and is generating revenue now. Not all of the companies on this list will make it, and there are many more out there that are joining the game. So let's appreciate the ones that are already successful at this point.  

**Here's an analogy I like to use when people say that you should invest in Astra before Rocket Lab because they have half the valuation**: 

Why does Kevin Durant (small forward for the NBA's Brooklyn Nets) make $41M in the 2021-2022 season, whereas Cade Cunningham (#1 2021 NBA draft pick for Detroit Pistons) only gets paid $8.4M. Cunningham is an awesome basketball player and may one day be a max-deal player like Kevin Durant, but as of right now, he hasn't played a single game in the NBA. He has the potential to be great, but until he gains experience and proves himself, he's not as valuable to his team as Kevin Durant is to the Nets (or Team USA for that matter). Rocket Lab is Kevin Durant and Astra is Cade Cunningham in this analogy if you haven't put that together at this point. I do believe Astra will be successful in a couple of years, but there is no denying that Rocket Lab is 4-5 years ahead of Astra, and with the expansion of Rocket Lab's business into space systems and satellites, I think they widen the gap further between them and their competitors, while hopefully also narrowing the gap between them and SpaceX, the latter being the clear leader right now by a long shot.

&#x200B;

**Disclosure**: This is not financial advice. Invest at your own risk. I am invested long in Rocket Lab and Astra, but more heavily in Rocket Lab because of their multi-year track record for success.

8 months ago - our mod u/Pavboy1, sadly and suddenly passed away at a young age.

He was travelling around India with his friends and had a stroke of some sort and then contracted Meningitis. He was repatriated to New Zealand prior to succumbing to the illness, and his life celebrated with close friends and family. 

He did a whole lot for this sub and was a friend of mine indeed. He's missed and will forever be a part of r/RocketLab in mod and in memory. 

As a community and as Kiwi's I'd like to try and organise something fitting for James:Pavboy1 in some way, dreams are free, but would be so good to get something of his on a flight, be it a plaque or something similar.

Please accept my apologies for the delay and maybe we can get something done to mark the one year of his passing.

## What is going to be on board for this flight?

### STP-27RM 

Rocket Lab will carry the Monolith satellite for the USSF's Space Test Program (STP) to space to explore and demonstrate the use of a deployable sensor, where the sensor‚Äôs mass is a substantial fraction of the total mass of the spacecraft, changing the spacecraft‚Äôs dynamic properties and testing ability to maintain spacecraft attitude control. Analysis from the use of a deployable sensor aims to enable the use of smaller satellite buses when building future deployable sensors such as weather satellites, thereby reducing the cost, complexity, and development timelines.

RocketLab_posts.csv,You‚Äôve heard all the negativity being thrown at Rocket Lab‚Äôs ‚ÄòHumanity Star‚Äô. It‚Äôs time now for a little positivity.,"For those who claim that Humanity Star has no scientific value, I argue the point ‚ÄòWhy does everything in space need to be science related?‚Äô I was hoping we could have space tourism, orbiting hotels, and other non-science endeavors up there as well. Space is a big place. There is room for both. And for those astronomers who claim that it causes light pollution, I argue that it has no lights onboard. The only way to see it is from reflected sunlight. And when it is on the night side of Earth it won‚Äôt be reflecting any sunlight because it will be in the Earth‚Äôs shadow. The only chance you will have of seeing it at all will be around sunrise or sunset. And remember that all satellites reflect sunlight (even the science ones). Airplanes on the other hand do have lights onboard and are visible at night but astronomers don‚Äôt seem to be complaining about them. For those who claim that it is simply more space garbage, be aware that it was placed into an orbit that will cause it to burn up in about 9 months. So it cleans up after itself. And for those who will then claim that it‚Äôll still be ‚Äò9 months of space garbage‚Äô I say the following: Instead of the thousands of evil spy satellites that are up there continuously taking our picture, Humanity Star is peaceful. Nobody is making money off of it. It can be experienced by almost everybody on the planet. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre rich or poor. It doesn‚Äôt matter what language you speak. It doesn‚Äôt matter what skin color you have. It has the power to touch us all and make us smile. And if a little one meter wide carbon fiber ball has the power to do that then it is something wonderful! You can hate it if you want to but with so many bad things taking place around the world each and every day why would anyone choose to single this out?",95,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/7te4rr/youve_heard_all_the_negativity_being_thrown_at/,-0.6183,0.076,0.834,0.089

# Youtube Webcast: TBA

## Recovery Attempt

‚ÄúThere And Back Again‚Äù is also a recovery mission
where, for the first time, Rocket Lab will attempt a midair capture of Electron‚Äôs first stage as it returns from
space using parachutes and a helicopter.
Like previous recovery missions, Electron‚Äôs first stage
will undertake a series of complex maneuvres designed
to enable it to survive the extreme heat and forces of
atmospheric re-entry. Electron will be equipped with a
heat shield to help protect the stage‚Äôs nine Rutherford
engines and a parachute to slow Electron down in
order for Rocket Lab‚Äôs customized Sikorsky S-92
helicopter to catch the stage as it returns.
After catching the stage, the helicopter will attempt
to offload the stage onto a recovery vessel which will
transport it back to Rocket Lab‚Äôs Production Complex
for analysis. Upon success of this recovery, Electron
will be one step closer to being the first reusable
orbital small sat launcher.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Electron + Photon can send a payload to Jupiter among other things,"As, the title states, yes Jupiter is within reach for Rocketlab.

So while reading this SpaceNews [article](https://spacenews.com/nasa-studying-larger-mars-helicopters/) on Martian helicopters, I had a look at the associated [white paper](https://baas.aas.org/pub/2021n4i361/release/1?readingCollection=7272e5bb) and discovered it was the place peeps had been submitting white papers for the upcoming decadal review. (I had actually been searching for this location for a while, but hadn't found it). Anyway while going through the literally hundreds of papers because I umm... have spare time on my hands let say, I discovered this [little gem](https://baas.aas.org/pub/2021n4i366/release/1?readingCollection=7272e5bb) right here. A paper from Rocketlab on the deep space capabilities of Electron (/GTO launcher) + Photon.

And may I say, it's a little ripper. (although somewhat difficult to find; why hasn't it been advertised???)

https://preview.redd.it/x1972pj9ct771.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9810edba3bebe563c38bde3f8c42b1266b3dcf2

You can see the large variety of available here; Moon (both orbit and surface), Lagrange orbits, comets, asteroids, interstellar objects, the dwarf planet Ceres, Mars (and it's moons), Venus and yes, flybys of Jupiter and it's Moons.

I suppose I should discuss launch vehicles in r/RocketLab. The fact that a SLV Electron with Photon can deliver payloads to the variety of locations listed is impressive, but rideshare GTO is another cheap cost launch with impressive capabilities in it's own right. (also Electron + Photon has a listed C3 capability >0 at 30km\^2/s\^2, which might make it more capable than New Glenn to high C3s, which is a very humorous concept). Neutron/dedicated launches is very interesting here, because the performance increase is significant. These missions will likely break out of the very low cost category (and I think Photon will be made a bit larger), but stuff like Jupiter orbiters instead of flybys becomes within the realm of possibility. (side note: Wet mass of deep space Photon is 320kg.)

[Attempts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_Common_Spacecraft_Bus) at producing a modular space bus for space exploration have been made (and most of the time spacecraft are based on existing commercial satellites), but haven't really been that successful. Photon already has a large commercial base, multiple deep space missions on the books (Capstone, their private Venus mission + 2 for Escapade).

On this discussion on commercial enabled space science; I think this [white paper](https://baas.aas.org/pub/2021n4i169/release/1?readingCollection=7272e5bb) on commercial lunar exploration explains the potential of Photon pretty well;

>This rapid pace of the CLPS missions is also appealing to PIs who, for the first time, have the opportunity to do repeated or iterated investigations to the same planetary destination, and could conceivably have numerous such opportunities in their career. That is a new paradigm for doing science investigations in space.

NASA Venus exploration has been non-existent although just ramped up significantly. But like there was a 25 year gap in NASA missions. That's getting to the point that Venusian specialists from those missions start leaving the workforce because they're too old and people to replace them don't start because there's no missions. It's the closest planet to Earth and yet a gap of 25 years. Think about Ceres scientists; the next mission to there could be decades away, with New Frontiers and Discovery being booked out, so they're just going to have rely on observations by Dawn (which to be fair, they're still getting stuff out of). Unless of course we could do a flyby mission for like 40 million $.

Now on Venus missions, I wouldn't be surprised if Photon ends up aiding those missions by providing an opportunity to send tech demos in like 2026. Basically, small sats missions like Photon aren't going to replace larger missions; instead they will augment and help them achieve so much more both before the mission and in followup observations.

If something goes on a mission previously (like Insight heat probe), your next opportunity to get the data again could be decades away. These commercial  could provide followups to cover failures within years instead. Or avoid it in the first place by catching it out with tech demo missions before it.

Photon is also a whole lot more responsive to opportunities like an interstellar flybys because it's a production line spacecraft.

Honestly though, I'm not mentioning 1/4 of the science possibilities what was mentioned; go check out the paper. This [paper](https://baas.aas.org/pub/2021n4i403/release/1?readingCollection=7272e5bb) provides a list of benefits of commercial based space exploration missions; 1. Risk acceptance 2. Rapid tech iteration, 3. Exploration of under explored targets, 4. New mission architectures (constellations) 5. workforce training and diversification to give better pipeline 6. broadening of career opportunities.

tldr for r/RKLB; buy $RKLB because they're going to be building/launching a whole bunch of deep space missions in the future imo.

This isn't the most cogent post, but look, I'm hyped for this decade of space exploration for many reasons, and stuff like Photon is a driving reason. 60s eat your goddamn heart out; the 20s is going to be the best decade for spaceflight yet and it's just the beginning.",83,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/o8y2lu/electron_photon_can_send_a_payload_to_jupiter/,0.9988,0.155,0.817,0.027

RocketLab_posts.csv,Neutron will be a bigger rocket. Should we expect Dream Chaser as a potential payload?,"We had a similar discussion on this earlier that the weight of Sierra Space‚Äôs Dream Chaser spacecraft would exceed the payload capability of a Neutron rocket which would of been about 8000 kg. But looks like Rocket Lab is pushing for Neutron to be bigger with most likely a bigger payload capability. Rockets can improve over time; for example the first version of Falcon 9 began with a payload capability of 9000 kg but is now above 22,000 kg with the Block 5 version.

It‚Äôs possible Peter Beck and the Rocket Lab team want to be a little more ambitious and enable more from the design.

Dream Chaser + Neutron could be a huge benefit for human Spaceflight that could generate billions of revenue from NASA‚Äôs Commercial Crew Program.

Here are 3 reasons why I believe this could be beneficial:

1. Dream Chaser is a nearly readied system. The cargo version is getting prepared for a launch in 2022 on the Vulcan rocket. A lot of development has been put into this spacecraft; Sierra Space seems to really confident that this could fly humans soon. Rocket Lab does seem committed to vertical integration but developing and building a human-spacecraft could take years and a lot of funding. It might be easier to use a system that‚Äôs ready to go when the Neutron is ready.

2. Neutron should be more affordable than a Vulcan rocket, and if Neutron is going to have larger capabilities than before then Sierra Space might purchase flights from Rocket Lab.

3. Boeing‚Äôs Starliner is years behind, overpriced, and NASA is losing confidence in it. SpaceX‚Äôs Dragon showed success in the commercial crew program which pretty much guarantees it will be a continued program since it enables human Spaceflight for a fraction of the original cost. But Starliner is a drag for the program, at some point NASA will want to bring another human spacecraft onboard; Dream chaser has already been partially funded by NASA so this vehicle seems most likely.

I just feel like this would be a missed opportunity if Dream Chaser was not consider for being used on a Neutron. What are your thoughts? If Rocket Lab is serious about getting into human Spaceflight I feel like this a good option to take.",78,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/pzvwqf/neutron_will_be_a_bigger_rocket_should_we_expect/,0.9973,0.206,0.762,0.032

RocketLab_posts.csv,Any competition besides SpaceX?,"I discovered Rocket Lab recently. I follow a guy called Emmet Peppers. He became a multi millionaire with Tesla stock and has a $3 million investment in SpaceX. He talked about a company called Rocketlab (which I of course had never heard about) and I have been intrigued about it ever since and actually watched every single video of Peter Beck that I could find.

The investment thesis is as follows:
 - Rocketlab, while being a very distant second place to SpaceX, is many years ahead of the completion, and that as such, the valuation could be very attractive long term
 - Peter Beck is extremely skilled and talented and could be a generational founder 

I have been trying to validate the assumption that Rocketlab is years ahead of the competition (besides spacex)

It has been somewhat of a challenge because there are from what I read ‚Äú100s of startups‚Äù. I did notice though that some guys, including some guys with YouTube channels about space, often mentioned Astra, Relativity Space and Firefly.

Last months I spent a few hours trying to watch the CEOs of Astra space, Relativity Space and Firefly.

The only CEO that somewhat stood out was the one of Firefly. I would say that Chris Kemp from Astra was probably the one who raised my eyebrows the most when he emphasized on the absolute need to do daily launches, using mobile launch pads, even insisted that having the capability to launch within 24 hours notice would soon be in demand from space startups, argued that 3D printing and reusability were unnecessary, and used the failing OEM car industry as a model for Astra.

I also reviewed the CEO of Relativity Space who somewhat reminded me about Astra (as far as making huge claims). All the CEO was talking about was ‚Äú3D printing‚Äù. I also visited relativity space‚Äôs website and was perplexed by claims such as making a rocket with ‚Äú100x fewer parts‚Äù. I also was perplexed by the Terran R Rocket which relativity space intends to design as fully reusable (the company has never gone to orbit and intends to use full reusability??)

I did not get a chance to review Virgin Orbit. I am in general skeptical of Virgin Galactic and Chamath Palihapitiya (every single SPACs that he‚Äôs involved with seems to be going nowhere). I also noticed that many in the community were making fun of Blue Origin.

Overall I would say I feel a little reassured as RocketLab being ahead of anything besides SpaceX, but I do notice though that several people, including people that I follow, frequently talk about companies like relativity space or ABL.

Is there any company that is a real threat to rocketlab - Besides SpaceX? What are your thoughts?

## What is going to be on board for this flight?
The ANDESITE (Ad-Hoc Network Demonstration for Extended Satellite-Based Inquiry and Other Team Endeavors) sat, the M2 Pathfinder satellite and 3 undisclosed payloads for the NRO 

## ANDESITE
Created by electrical and mechanical engineering students and professors at Boston University, the
ANDESITE spacecraft will use a wireless network of lightweight minisatellites to measure the strength and
the direction of electrical currents flowing in and out of Earth‚Äôs magnetic field, the impact of which can affect
radio communications and electrical systems on Earth. ANDESITE‚Äôs acquired datasets will help researchers
better understand the makeup of Earth‚Äôs polar lights (aka aurora) and better predict potentially dangerous
solar storms.

 (source: Presskit)

## M2 Pathfinder
The University of New South Wales (UNSW) Canberra Space, together with the Australian Government,
have developed the M2 Pathfinder ‚Äì a satellite to test communications and other technologies in low
Earth orbit, including reprogrammable software-based radio capabilities.

RocketLab_posts.csv,"Rocket Lab's path to Profitability: Increasing SolAero Gross Margins, Electron Recovery, and Responsive Launches","In Rocket Lab's [earnings call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE) yesterday, they made some very interesting statements about how the company plans to increase gross margins and achieve profitability.

First, Rocket Lab [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE&t=2622s) that increasing gross margin on AolAero is the best thing that they can do to improve profitability on the Space Systems side. Rocket Lab said that they have a 24 month plan to increase SolAero gross margins from ""high single digits"" to a whopping 30%! They said that they are very confident in this plan, and that executing on it is only a matter of time. Rocket Lab said that revenue from the acquired companies SolAero, Advanced Solutions Inc, and Planetary Systems Corporation was $28M in Q2 2022, and the vast majority (> $20M?) was from SolAero. Therefore, increasing the gross margin to 30% on SolAero revenue is a really big deal!

Secondly, Rocket Lab [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE&t=3102s) that for their new [Responsive Space Program](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-introduces-responsive-space-program/), the cost per launch is 15-30% higher than the typical Electron launch price of $7.5M, and the vast majority of that 15-30% markup goes directly to gross margin since most of their launch costs are fixed costs. Between Electron reuse (70% of cost is in the first stage) and responsive launches, I see a clear path to increasing the gross margins of Electron!

These statements really help to paint a clear path to profitability in my mind. With stronger than expected revenues and a clear path to profitability, it‚Äôs no wonder that Rocket Lab stock surged over 20% today. What do you guys think? What do you think Rocket Lab's plans for SolAero are? Increasing automation? Integration of solar panels into other components? Outsourcing of manufacturing? I sure hope it isn‚Äôt outsourcing, the United States really needs to manufacture its own solar panels.",73,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wmsfbg/rocket_labs_path_to_profitability_increasing/,0.9784,0.17,0.755,0.075

RocketLab_posts.csv,How important is the upcoming Rocket Lab moon mission is? Am I missing anything?,"https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/lunar/

Scheduled in March of next year, Rocket Lab will launch a electron rocket with a Photon Lunar spacecraft that will carry a CAPSTONE to cis-lunar orbit to the moon.  


Why is this important?  

The goal is to insert a small sat into a near rectilinear lunar halo orbit - something that has never before been attempted before. 

It is important this succeeds for the future or the NASA moon artemis program as it will provide non-stop communication to the Gateway as there will be no blackouts like prior moon missions and it provides access to the entire lunar surface.

The CAPSTONE small sat will be delivered to the moon by a Rocket Lab photon spacecraft.  This photon spacecraft is what makes capstone possible and appears very unique and will help pay the way for the Venus mission.  Also if successful will lead to future customers signing up for Rocket Lab‚Äôs photon spacecraft.

CAPSTONE will be delivered to lunar orbit by the Photon spacecraft, NOT a kickstage or upper stage, but a spacecraft (Photon).  This will be huge to showing the world what the photon can do and will likely lead to more and more missions down the road.

Anything else that makes this mission important?",73,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/rm9jnp/how_important_is_the_upcoming_rocket_lab_moon/,0.884,0.081,0.899,0.02
RocketLab_posts.csv,12 years later and some thing's never change...,"
...and some thing's only get better.

Twelve year's ago Peter Beck and Rocket Lab first touched space with Atea 1, a sounding rocket that was never designed to go orbital.

Then a few day's ago Beck and the Rocket Lab team set a new company record for fastest turnaround between orbital launches. 21 days!

It's no surprise to see Becks instinctual celebration has stayed the same.

In this [video](https://youtu.be/ETEWnRsa_Ik) you'll see the launch of Atea-1. The first Rocket built by Beck and the early engineers at Rocket Lab as a private company. They started with resources provided by Mark Rocket and Sir Michael Fay. Let me get ahead of you, you're going to see and hear some funny stuff. A last second delivery to Beck from a helicopter(no wonder he likes them so much). You'll also hear a guy say ""did it go?"" Judging by Beck's double fists in the air, it go'd. The tracking components they used were faulty, so it was never found. But being a sounding rocket you get literal evidence. 

I noticed a familiar double fists in the air during the last launch. Late in the stream a curly haired figure steps in to check if both satellites deployed nominally. Go to [1:13:45](https://youtu.be/PmCl2Hs8enc) and tell me I'm wrong.

Both these rockets are mainly built with carbon fiber. I have heard Beck say he only uses carbon fiber. First stage, second stage, fuel tanks, wherever he can. I don't know how they get the fuel tanks to work, but they do. 

So now here they are twelve years later with a wealth of knowledge on launching rockets to orbit. Working with the same material the whole time. Then learning how that material reacts on re-entry. I wrote this because I want to hear some discussion on the future possibilities of ""Rocket Lab Carbon Fiber.""

I think that was part of the hardware we got with the Neutron Presentation. I don't care that it wasn't bolted  down, or that it was at room temperature. A falling rocket isn't bolted down. So was the i-beam the one way to mimic forces from hypersonic waves? The fact they are sticking with CF makes me realize they are trying to learn from modern airplanes to make the modern day rocket. Two more things that weren't physical hardware, but interesting concepts were the fairings, and the suspended second stage. Sure the perfect end would be Beck stepping into some fairings that close....but whatcha gonna do

I'm trying to get a better understanding of composite materials and found [this old lecture](https://youtu.be/V7bX4c9XWes). I didn't make it through the whole thing, just the first part before the more technical discussion. He brings up a key advantage is ""tailorable anisotropy"", I was wondering how that could help in Neutrons design? As well as the ability to manipulate the overall process so many different ways. What do you think the limits are of the chemistry of the resin? 

I thought this professor did a great job in the early part of the lecture. He made it fairly easy to understand. It's also seven years old and he's talking about getting his own automated fiber placement machine. So that technology must be further along.",73,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/re8re1/12_years_later_and_some_things_never_change/,0.9865,0.091,0.879,0.03

[Thomas Burghardt](https://twitter.com/TGMetsFan98) on twitter has noticed that Rocketlab has increased the length of the second stage of Electron.

we know that the length of the fairing has increased, but if you look at the length of the umbilical connector for s2, it has also increased in length. I expect this to be mainly due the lengthening of s2, as lengthening of the firing should not need a higher umbilical connector, since that connector attaches at the base of the fairing (afaik)",74,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/quoml1/rocketlab_has_potentially_increased_the_length_of/,0.296,0.062,0.912,0.026

SDA, an organization under the U.S. Space Force, is building a mesh[ network of military satellites](https://spacenews.com/space-development-agency-renames-constellation-to-reflect-focus-on-u-s-warfighter/?preview_id=140632&preview_nonce=0118ef1bb4&preview=true&_thumbnail_id=141872) in low Earth orbit known as the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.

SDA Director Derek Tournear speaking at a conference earlier this month said the agency was negotiating a contract with an unspecified supplier for 18 satellites to expand the U.S. military low Earth orbit constellation.

One of the portions of SDA‚Äôs proliferated architecture is the [Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta](https://spacenews.com/space-development-agencys-data-transport-satellites-get-more-complex/), made up of communications satellites to enable beyond line-of-sight connectivity for military forces on the ground.¬†

Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta is projected to have 90 satellites. The agency in August announced it awarded $1.5 billion in contracts to Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman for 72 Beta satellites.

Tournear said Dec. 7 at a National Security Space Association event that SDA was planning to add another 18 Beta satellites to the constellation and was in negotiations with another vendor that he did not disclose.

The Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta satellites ‚Äî projected to launch in 2026 and 2027 ‚Äî will carry radios using the UHF (Ultra High Frequency) and S-band frequencies that military and intelligence units rely upon for voice and low-speed data transmissions.

‚ÄúWe are looking at putting another approximately 18 satellites on contract, and we‚Äôre working with a third vendor to do that, and we should make that announcement shortly,‚Äù Tournear said Dec. 7 at the NSSA forum.¬†

According to Rocket Lab‚Äôs SEC filing, the contract includes a base amount of $489 million, with incentives and options worth $26 million. ‚ÄúWork under the agreement will begin immediately with the delivery of the space vehicles to the customer for launch slated for 2027, operation of the satellites through 2030, and an option to operate the satellites through 2033.‚Äù

RocketLab_posts.csv,Cleverly naming rockets,"So I was thinking about how rocket companies are naming their rockets and I realized something. 

So Rocket Lab has the Electron rocket. Then they added a Photon upper stage. 
In atoms, when an Electron(rocket) is given enough energy it moves to a higher energy state (the upper atmosphere). 
The Electron then gives off a Photon(upper stage), which is then followed by the Electron falling back to its original energy state(the ground). 

The following is just some of my ideas to add to this family of rockets. I don't necessarily think Rocket Lab should or would make these rockets(mostly because they lead into medium lift launchers) since that would kinda defeat Rocket Labs current niche. And that these ideas are moreso ""built"" on the idea of clever naming not good rocket science.

One of my ideas to add onto the ""fundamental particle"" (maybe ""Atomic particle"" which is not quite true due to Photon, but that's neither here nor there) family of rockets would be for Rocket Lab to create a Proton(yes I know there is already a family of rockets names Proton) Rocket thats sole purpose is to be a booster for the Electron rocket for heavier payloads. The name of this combo rocket would then be named the Neutron rocket. For shits and gigs they could then(only for this specific rocket) rename the Photon kick stage to the Neutrino(more correctly Antineutrino but just Neutrino sounds better) kick stage. All of this is for the fact that in atoms that undergo beta decay, a Neutron changes to a Proton, which then releases an Electron as well as an (anti)Neutrino.

I found this incredibly entertaining and thought other people may as well. If anyone has any other ideas for clever rocket names please feel free to share them.

Edit: I added some of my ideas for future ""possible"" rockets",68,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/j1azmv/cleverly_naming_rockets/,0.9761,0.123,0.834,0.043

I love what Rocket Lab is doing.  They are putting up satellites for lots of different companies from different countries.  Their work is having a large positive impact for employees in New Zealand and in the U.S.  They are walking the walk and not just talking the talk like a bunch of these other professed space companies.  It just irks me that as Beck is doing what needs to be done to be successful, the CEO of their biggest competitor met with a presidential candidate today who is asking for money.  You know if that happens there will be an understanding that SpaceX gets even more preferential treatment than anyone else.  Business success should be based on the hard work of the employees and not backdoor deals.  Keep up the good work Rocket Lab.  Can‚Äôt wait to see you on the moon.

It was berthed at a private dock which is also used by BlueBridge to park cars waiting to board the 8am ferry sailing.  I attempted to take a close up photo within the private dock but a RocketLabs staffer on board told me to go away.  Unfortunately, I got locked in the dock area and the staffer then found me. After a friendly warning, they arranged to let me out (phew). They did confirm the first stage was onboard and that AIS (the shipping tracker) had been turned off after they left the Chatham Islands.  A launch was then unloaded and then Seaworker went for a cruise around the inner harbour (presumably waiting for the Rocketlabs' truck to arrive)  and the photo was taken from the Clyde Quay Wharf public lookout.

&#x200B;

Some personal takeaways:

\-Beck seems like he doesn¬¥t like Kemp or Astra

\-Chris Kemp seems to be a very unsympathetic guy

\-Beck is the CEO/CFO likely feeling the most comfortable about his company and his decisions and thoughts being the most thought through

\-Shahzad being the CFO of Relativity Space probably wasn¬¥t their best guy for this discussion (Tim Ellis (CEO) would probably have been the better choice)

\-Financial guys are very Astra and Relativity Space focused while forgetting about the big winner in the room",64,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/pa9z5n/interesting_discussion_rocketlabastrarelativity/,0.9698,0.159,0.777,0.065

May seem like a odd question but I think it‚Äôs important to ask.  Now Rocket Lab‚Äôs Neutron rocket is not quite competing with Starship but rather the Falcon 9.  However if Starship is successful would that mean potential customers would go with Starship (or Falcon 9) versus Rocket Lab and Neutron? Is there enough demand for both company‚Äôs rockets ?  Is there enough differences to make them both needed?

However Rocket Lab does launches that seem to focus on a different market segment then Starship and Rocket Lab also manufactures satellite components that could and likely go into many of the satellites that Starship is launching.",65,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/rf79gh/if_spacex_is_successful_with_starship_is_that_a/,0.8873,0.111,0.861,0.027

RocketLab_posts.csv,New kick stage,"As I mentioned after looking at the press kit for this most recent flight, the kick stage seems to have changed -- it had a longer firing time than before.

Here's one writeup of what changed:

> [The Curie kick stage flown on Wednesday‚Äôs mission included a performance enhancement. The kick stage‚Äôs engine previously used a single ‚Äúgreen‚Äù non-toxic fuel ‚Äî a monopropellant system, in propulsion parlance ‚Äî while the upgraded engine is fed by a green bi-propellant mixture with a fuel and an oxidizer. // After releasing Astro Digital‚Äôs Palisade satellite, the Curie kick stage reignited to drop out of orbit, according to Rocket Lab.](https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/10/17/rocket-lab-delivers-on-dedicated-launch-for-astro-digital/)

The orbit was circular 1,200 km and the kick stage deorbited, so even with a relatively light satellite (16U == 25kg or so?) that's a lot of work for the kick stage. It didn't even wait for apogee to do the circularization or deorbit burns.

As a side comment, it would be nice if the launch history wiki would include orbit information.",61,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/djfqhr/new_kick_stage/,-0.1779,0.018,0.954,0.028

Now, I am posting my DD into both of the Rocket Lab subreddit, as I am new to writing DD and I want to hit as wide of an audience as I can. One disclaimer (for those who do not like stock talk), this DD is not meant to encourage buying of the stock, nor is it financial advice or a stock-only DD, I merely want to dive into this company and simply spark some discussion on it!

Now, Rocket Lab is a private aerospace manufacturer and small satellite launch service provider. The company was founded in 2006 by Peter Beck and is headquartered in Long Beach, California, with additional facilities in New Zealand and Australia. Rocket Lab specializes in the development and launch of small rockets capable of delivering payloads of up to 300 kilograms to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab‚Äîself-designated as a leader in launch and space systems‚Äîis a company that has a chance at becoming a highly profitable giant over the next decade and beyond. In my honest opinion, Rocket Lab currently thrives off of the crumbs of the current space industry ecosystem. With Space X increasingly focused upon one goal‚Äîthanks to their controversial, yet nevertheless, fearless leader‚Äîbeing Mars, Rocket Labs can (and in my opinion will) become one of the go-to space companies for low earth orbit launches in the near term and in the long-term become one of the go-to space company for launches between the Moon, Venus, and Mars as well. Rocket Lab currently lives off of the crumbs left behind by NASA, Space X, and the United States military-industrial complex.

[  Like these two legends from the movie War Dogs, Rocket Lab is determined to become the go-to space company for transporting all types of goods into orbit. For those of you who have not seen the movie \(I personally highly recommend it\), essentially, when these two start their arms-dealing company, they focus upon all of the small contracts that the government is putting out for arms supplies. The contracts that the big players are ignoring, due to their small sizes, even so, these small contracts are worth hundreds of thousands to low millions. Now, this is where Rocket Lab currently lies in the industry.](https://preview.redd.it/j6wloa05vd4b1.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fc5120309359cb8789b861e68009133ef92d376)

[ \\""A new space race has begun, and most Americans are not even aware of it. This race is not \[about\] political prestige or military power. This new race involves the whole human species in a contest against time.\\"" - Ben Bova ](https://preview.redd.it/iliovpg7vd4b1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=f22e8c01f45a403829c6c681966f1a9a53fab213)

Now, before I dive into everything here, I need every to understand that this industry is on the verge of immense change and rapid evolution. We are currently in the first stage of the world‚Äôs Second Space Race. As a student of History, I can confidently tell you that there are murmurings within the historical community, that this is the case, beginning with the creation and success of Space X‚Äôs first reusable rocket: the Falcon 9. On December 21st of 2015, when the first Falcon 9 was launched and the landing was successful with the first stage fully recovered, the race began. In the same way that there is no single company above all others in the airline, shipping & transportation, or car manufacturing industries, is the same reason I do not believe that Space X will alone run the space industry‚Äôs transportation needs. There is plenty of room for companies like Rocket Lab to fill the gaps Space X cannot and in a decade‚Äôs time, there will be plenty of room for even more companies. Yet, there are no companies that are even close to competing with Space X‚Äîother than Rocket Lab‚Äîat this time. Now, I won‚Äôt go deeply into most of these competitors in this deep dive, but to be short, Astra is on the verge of total failure, Virgin Galactic has been playing an entirely different game‚Äîspace tourism, which there is a massive market for, just perhaps won‚Äôt be penetrated by them‚Äîthey likewise seem to be failing. While Blue Origin has been playing a strong game and Space X an even stronger one, albeit more and more focused solely on Mars as the years go on.

[ Here you can see the 1-year charts of Rocket Lab, Astra, Virgin, and Boeing for reference, as you can see, these charts speak volumes. Rocket Lab has been having a tough year but has found a nice bottom and is consistently bouncing from lows in the $3.6-4 range. While Astra has been reduced to a penny stock, with their future unknown. Virgin Galactic is only maintaining below Rocket Lab‚Äôs share price, partly due to the large number of Retail investors that do not know much and refuse to let it die, coupled with a small hope that the company can recover in the coming years. Boeing is here for reference as to what a successful, large-cap company involved in a similar industry \(and the space industry as well\), should look like over the course of a decent year. ](https://preview.redd.it/4lgxhawavd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d24878b2d7dc72b1e5c87ccd01d67c077485001a)

*Now, there are a few assumptions that I am making that we need to cover before diving into the real DD:* Whether it be because we live in the beginnings of a second Space Race (fueled by privatized space companies and the world‚Äôs governments) or because of technological advancement and a rising interest in space, the increase in rocket launches, space development (in Earth‚Äôs orbit, the Moon, and Mars), and the lowering costs of space launches‚Ä¶ it will become exponentially cheaper, easier, and faster to launch into orbit and the industry as a whole will have a massive boom‚Äîakin, in a way, to the industrial revolution‚Äîover the mid-to-late 2020s into the early 2030s. With the mid-to-end 2030s and early 2040s, we will see massive developments in terms of low-Earth orbit manufacturing facilities, tourist destinations, and stations, as well as settlements on the Moon for mining and refueling for greater exploration and colonization of the Sol System as a whole.

Now these are in part assumptions, but I think once one does the research and looks at the fact, all of this is very achievable. Even if it does not occur in this way, you can shift the dates by an additional decade and every time you do, the more likely, easier, and cheaper it all becomes.

Rocket Lab's business model revolves around providing cost-effective and frequent access to space for small satellite operators. The company aims to simplify the process of deploying satellites by offering dedicated launches on its Electron rocket. Rocket Lab operates as an end-to-end service provider, handling the entire launch process from mission planning and payload integration to launch and on-orbit operations.

# Section 1: Rocket Lab Takes Flight! The Electron & the Neutron

[  ‚ÄòRocket Lab is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, complete spacecraft design and manufacturing, satellite components, flight software, and an on-orbit management.‚Äô ‚Äì Rocket Labs](https://preview.redd.it/nbt3cd8dvd4b1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc518b0149113dc115f082394c2b6e8b33e36707)

Rocket Lab's primary launch vehicle, the Electron, is a two-stage rocket powered by Rutherford engines, which use electric-pump-fed LOX/RP-1 propellants. The Electron is designed to optimize cost, flexibility, and rapid launch capability for small satellites. Rocket Lab has demonstrated numerous successful launches since its inaugural flight in 2017, showcasing its technological prowess and reliability. The small satellite market has been growing rapidly, driven by increased demand for data collection, communications, and Earth observation. Rocket Lab's focus on dedicated launches for small satellites positions it well to capture a significant portion of this expanding market. The company has already established a solid customer base, securing contracts with government agencies, research institutions, and commercial entities.

Rocket Labs‚Äîat the time of writing this‚Äîhas had 37 launches‚Äîwith a 91.89% success rate‚Äîdeployed 164 satellites, operates 3 launch pads, and is maintaining 3 Photon Satellites in the Earth‚Äôs orbit. Of the 164 satellites launched by Rocket Labs, they were commissioned to do so by a wide variety of clients, from NASA, Space Force, DARPA, to Canon. Rocket Labs is supported by Future Fund: Australia‚Äôs Sovereign Wealth Fund, Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Data Collective, Greenspring Associates, ACC, Promus Ventures, L One W One Ltd., and Lockheed Martin.

Rocket Lab‚Äôs main rocket, the Electron‚Äîbuilt and operated by Rocket Lab‚Äîhas flown 37 times and been successful 34 times, with only 3 failures. Rocket Lab‚Äôs key areas of business penetration lie in the launch of mid-sized service rockets, the manufacturing of space systems and satellites, and their adept ability to manufacture industrial space parts, applications, and proponents. The latter of which, they are sort of unopposed in terms of competition.

The Neutron‚ÄîRocket Lab‚Äôs medium-lift, mega constellation launcher‚Äîwill be able to launch 13,000 kilograms into low Earth orbit and it will be ‚Ä¶drum roll please‚Ä¶ reusable! The current goal is for it to launch in 2024. It will be designed for not only low earth orbital supply missions, but also deep space missions, and even human spaceflight. It will be fairing a design allowing for full reusability of the first stage and it will be lightweight, being made of Rock Lab‚Äôs own carbon composite structure. The home base for the Neutron will be at the Neutron Production Complex and the launch pad at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility and Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.

[ ‚ÄòThe Neutron Production Complex will be home to a rocket production, assembly, and integration facility, as well as a dedicated launch pad for the Neutron rocket located on the southern end of Wallops Island. The estimated 250,000 square foot state-of-the-art complex will be constructed on a 28-acre site adjacent to the Wallops Island Flight Facility and will include a Launch Control Center, Rocket Lab‚Äôs fifth global operations center for launch activities and on-orbit operations. To support rapid production of the Neutron rocket, current plans for the complex include automated fiber placement robotic production systems capable of laying up meters of Neutron‚Äôs new, specially formulated carbon composite structures in minutes. As a reusable rocket, Neutron is designed to land back on the Launch Complex 3 pad after a mission and from there it would be returned to the production complex for refurbishment and re-flight.‚Äô ](https://preview.redd.it/k592skwfvd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=279742c6d6196d860258d747af98f84e71b71470)

With Space X dominating large-load space orbital flight and transportation, Rocket Labs, in my honest opinion, is where Space X was roughly something like 6-8 years ago. While Rocket Lab intends to compete with Space X‚Äîwhether it will be considered competition in an industry this brand new and small, time will tell‚Äîfor cargo and humans to the low Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and even Venus! Space X and Elon Musk have made it abundantly clear that the goal of Space X is the large-scale settlement of Mars. While later models of Rocket Lab‚Äôs Neutron will be able to go to Mars and Venus, it appears that is not their main goal. In the near term (being the next two decades), they will be looking to dominate the low Earth orbit and Moon market as well as the manufacturing of industrial space parts, applications, and proponents.

# Section 2: The Space Industry & Company Fundamentals

Rocket Lab faces competition from other commercial launch providers, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. However, the company differentiates itself by specializing in small satellite launches, offering a tailored solution for this niche market. Rocket Lab's Electron rocket provides the advantage of dedicated launches and the flexibility to reach specific orbits, making it an attractive option for small satellite operators.

Rocket Lab has raised significant funding through various investment rounds, securing capital from venture capital firms, strategic partners, and government entities. Notable investors include Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Lockheed Martin. The company's ability to attract substantial investment indicates confidence in its business model and growth potential. Rocket Lab operates within the regulatory framework of the countries in which it launches its rockets. The company holds necessary licenses and approvals from government agencies, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Compliance with safety regulations and adherence to environmental guidelines are crucial aspects of Rocket Lab's operations.

Despite its achievements, Rocket Lab faces several risks and challenges. The space industry is highly competitive, and the success of the company depends on its ability to secure launch contracts and maintain a steady launch cadence. Regulatory changes, launch failures, or delays could impact Rocket Lab's operations and reputation. Additionally, the emergence of new technologies or market disruptors could pose a threat to the company's market position

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room, the Quarterly Results. To preface, negative quarterly results mean‚Äîpardon my French‚Äîjack-shit (at least in the short term) for a company such as Rocket Lab, that is looking at penetrating a market such as the space industry. We are going to look at the past four Quarterly Results in chronological order.

**Q2 2022 Report:** Rocket Lab achieved record revenue of $55.5 million, showing significant growth compared to the previous quarter (36% sequential growth) and the same quarter in the previous year (392% YoY growth). Despite the revenue growth, the company reported a negative EPS of $-0.08, indicating a net loss for the quarter.

**Q3 2022 Report:** Another record revenue was achieved, reaching $63.1 million, with a sequential growth of 14% and an impressive YoY growth of 1,093%. The company's EPS improved slightly to $-0.07 but still remained negative. The fourth quarter revenue is expected to be lower, ranging between $51 million and $54 million, as a launch customer's push extends into 2023.

**Q4 2022 Report:** The company's revenue for Q4 reached $51.8 million, showing a healthy year-over-year growth of 88%. The full-year revenue for fiscal 2022 amounted to $211 million, reflecting substantial growth of 239% compared to the previous year. The EPS remained negative at $-0.08.

**Q1 2023 Report:** The revenue for Q1 2023 was $54.9 million. Increasing revenue by 35% in the first quarter of 2023. Revenue from their launch business was $19.6 million, up $12 million from the prior quarter. Their EPS was $-0.08, indicating strong maintenance of their business. The second quarter is expected to show a significant revenue increase, with an estimated range of $60 million to $63 million.

Now, what does this all tell us? Firstly, they were very forthcoming with the quarterly expectations. Something one might think is not a big deal, but considering how a lot of publicly traded companies operate, this is a good thing. In each of their earnings reports, they have nearly exactly estimated their results, showing they are not attempting to mislead investors. The company has experienced impressive revenue growth throughout the reported quarters, indicating strong market performance and demand for its products/services. However, the negative EPS values suggest that the company is still operating at a net loss. From a shareholder‚Äôs perspective, the company's focus should be on achieving profitability and reducing the negative EPS, while maintaining consistent revenue growth. In my opinion, this stock is sitting just below a fair market value for what it is right now, sitting at just over $4, considering they are not fully profitable. Yet Rocket Lab continues to grow its business, making more contracts, and it stands a competitive chance. If they can turn a profit within 2-3 years, I think they will be one hell of a company. With their competitors failing left and right and none finding the success as Rocket Lab‚Äîother than Space X‚Äîthey could stand to be a massive company in a few decades, so massive, they‚Äôre bigger than Earth.

One last financial point to touch upon‚Ä¶ shorting, so here is some data, which is roughly one month outdated due to my difficulty in finding up-to-date information on the company without a Bloomberg Terminal (So, if anyone on the sub has access to a Bloomberg Terminal and would like to add to my DD in the comments, please do).

**Last Record Date:** May 15, 2023

**Outstanding Shares:** 478,660,000 shares

**Float Size:** 262,310,000 shares

**Short Percent of Float:** 9.80% (The short percent of float represents the percentage of shares available for trading that have been sold short).

**Average Trading Volume:** 4,044,396 shares

**Current Short Volume:** 25,710,000 shares

**Previous Short Volume:** 24,630,000 shares

**Change Vs. Previous Month**: +4.38%

**Dollar Volume Sold Short:** $111.58 million

**Short Interest Ratio / Days to Cover:** 7.7 (This ratio indicates the number of days it would take for the short sellers to cover their positions based on the average daily trading volume.).

The short interest in Rocket Lab has increased from the previous month, with a change of +4.38%. The short percent of the float is 9.80%, indicating that a significant portion of the available shares for trading has been sold short. Now, Rocket Lab‚Äôs short interest is relatively low for a company that has had consistent negative EPS and revenue. Showcasing that the big players in markets either A) believe this company will make a massive turnaround in the near future (1-3 years mark) or B) Rocket Lab, due to its size, is thankfully not on their radar. However, that said, the off-exchange short percentage is 57.69%, showcasing that A) public on-exchange short volume is a complete hoax and Hedge Funds, and other big players are beating down on the stock or B) all of this information is completely misrepresented to retail traders on purpose and the entirety of the United States market system is a complete farce.

# Section 3: Future Prospects & Big Moves

Rocket Lab has demonstrated strong performance and growth potential in the emerging small satellite launch market. The company continues to refine its launch processes, aiming to increase launch frequency and reduce costs further. Additionally, Rocket Lab has plans to develop a larger reusable rocket called Neutron, targeting the medium-lift market segment, which would expand its capabilities and market reach. The company has the potential to be the go-to company for low Earth orbital launches in the short term and in the long term, one of, if not the go-to company, for transportation to the Moon, Mars, and Venus.

[  Peter Beck, founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, did an interview last month on his take on the industry and their future prospects. I wanted to touch briefly on this \(you can find the video on YouTube\).](https://preview.redd.it/ced7t9iivd4b1.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=6579fcd100b405f44d1e65fb13cb185cefe6ed76)

Firstly, the video begins with the commentator stating, ""*With the Space Race this week*,"" the Space X rocket, the most powerful ever built, has scrubbed its launch. While Rocket Lab is adding a new service for testing hypersonic sub-orbital launches, being a welcome addition to the company‚Äôs wide array of services. Beck states that it is a very exciting time, stating that ‚Äú*the United States is kind of lacking behind in hypersonic technologies and this is a great opportunity to have high cadence, test flight environment for these payloads to really move forward the US‚Äôs hypersonic research*.‚Äù He goes on to talk about how these capabilities are essentially repurposed from Rocket Lab‚Äôs Electron Rocket capabilities: ‚Äú*We take a standard Electron orbital-class launch vehicle and we fly it in some really unique trajectories to provide these hypersonic trajectories‚Ä¶ it is taking an Electron and making a couple wee tweaks to it and having a great high frequency hypersonic testing platform that hasn‚Äôt existed*.‚Äù Beck goes on to speak on the launch cadence ‚Äú*being on target for 15 flights*‚Äù this year with the fastest turn around this year being 7 days between flights, saying ‚Äú*the machine is cranking and the vehicles are flying successfully and the last flight was a reusable vehicle and we splashed that down successfully and now we‚Äôre kind at the point where we are recycling and harvesting engines and components off of those launch vehicles and getting ready to put them back into service and re-fly them*.‚Äù He continues, stating, ‚Äú*I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm allowed to say exactly, but‚Ä¶ a whole multiple gambit of reused components that are all now re-entering the production line and going back into service*.‚Äù Morgan Brennan, the interviewer then speaks to how there is this emerging mismatch between supply and demand when it comes to the satellite launch market, with the fact that there are so many satellite constellations that are poised to go into orbit in the coming years and not enough capacity in terms of launching them. So, she then asks about the reusability of Electron and the development of the Neutron. Beck states that, ‚Äú*Electron is really serving that market very well, and there are lots of flight opportunities that are sort of just doing its thing, Neutron is the new flight opportunity for us‚Ä¶ 2026 to 2030 timeframe there is a massive deficit in launch and there are lots of constellations that are all really vying for an ability to get in orbit, so we saw that coming and started work on the vehicle and hopefully we can bring it into service in 2024 and really solve some of those problems and take advantage of that market opportunity*.‚Äù

Now, I don‚Äôt have to tell you all that this is very good to hear from Beck and this is very exciting, showcasing that he really believes Rocket Lab can penetrate this market and become a big player in the ever-evolving industry.

**Rocket Lab Making Big Moves Lately:**

¬∑ Bought Virgin Orbit HQ in California, this was a big win for the company, and folk on the sub were very excited to see this happen. Yay!

# Conclusion: An Ode to Humanity's Future

Rocket Lab has established itself as a leading player in the small satellite launch market, offering dedicated launch services tailored to the needs of small satellite operators. The company's technological capabilities, solid customer base, and innovative approach position it well for future growth.

Those who lived and grew up in the 1960s and 1970s believed that by the 21st century, mankind would be a space-faring civilization. People had a fascination with the unknown. It was embedded in pop culture, in movies like the 2001 Space Odyssey, Alien, and the Star Trek series. But the unfortunate truth is that after Apollo 17 on the 19th of December 1972, mankind has not left low-earth orbit. The American public lost interest, the government cut funding, and the Saturn V rockets were dismantled and replaced by space shuttles in the 1980s (spaceships not even built to leave low-earth orbit). The curiosity and desire to unravel the mystery of the universe are now again filling the hearts of people. Technology is becoming more advanced and cheaper.

With companies like Rocket Lab and Space X, the future is looking bright. We currently live in an era of mass information. One of the hardest aspects of life in the early-21st-century is learning how to filter all this information. The news of the accomplishments of Rocket Lab, Space X, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA), the European Space Agency (ESA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Space Force, are lost in the large volume of collective data. The average person does not believe how close we are to colonizing Luna and Mars; how close we are to becoming a multi-planetary species. If you walked up to someone on the street of New York City, today, and told them that in the mid-2040s, and by the latest, the 2050s, there will be hundreds if not thousands of people living in Earth's orbit, the upper atmosphere of Venus, the Moon, and Mars, the person would dismiss you in disbelief. But the same would have happened if you walked up to a person on the street of New York City on the 19th of July 1962 (before Kennedy‚Äôs speech) and told them that mankind would step foot on the moon in seven years. Companies like Rocket Lab, which will make orbital flight and transportation affordable, will allow for a new era of civilization, one which was only present and dreamed of in science fiction of the past.

[The Earth, as imaged from the Voyager 1 spacecraft, was suspended in a sunbeam, as the interstellar craft exited the Sol system in 1990. Earth is nearly 4 billion miles away in this image. That is us. That is humanity, all of us that have thus far, ever existed. We take to the stars in search of not only answers but in search of a purpose.](https://preview.redd.it/hnr23odlvd4b1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=298a1ee80b0bc5e3dc0ba5c3c61aa6a25c0682c1)

RocketLab_posts.csv,Neutron launching Kuiper Satellites for Amazon?,"Hi All,

I was thinking, what are the chances for Amazon awarding launch contract to RocketLab Neutron for its Kuiper Satellites?

RocketLab is already going to deliver reaction wheels (2-3K a year) for Kuiper. RocketLab also recently launched a high-volume star tracker (maybe also for Kuiper). All in all, seems like RocketLab is going to do a lot of work for Kuiper. Then why not launch also?

Amazon did sign launch contracts with Vulcan Centaur (ULA), New Glenn (BO) and Ariane 6 (ArianeSpace). All these medium to heavy lift launch vehicles are delayed and won't see a multiple launch cadence before 2025/2026. It is even questionable whether ULA and ArianeSpace can achieve a high launch cadence as their vehicles are expendable.

Amazon Kuiper is in a hurry to catch up with starlink, so they do not really have the luxury to wait. Therefore, I think there a good chances that RocketLab will get launch contracts from Amazon Kuiper. Neutron could potentially launch 4 or more times in 2025 and then scale rapidly from there i.e. providing Amazon Kuiper with better performance than all of the current launch contract holders.

A Neutron rocket could put roughly 18 Kuiper satellites (700kg per satellite) in orbit per launch at a price of $50 million. $ per kg will definitely be lower than with Vulcan Centaur and Ariane 6.

## What is going to be on board for this flight?

The primary payload aboard this mission includes nine of the latest generation SuperDove satellites from Planet, the operator of the world‚Äôs largest
constellation of Earth-imaging satellites. Each of the nine SuperDoves in Flock 4e‚Äô will be integrated with and deployed from Rocket Lab‚Äôs Maxwell
dispensers, the industry‚Äôs lightest CubeSat dispenser in its class. Planet‚Äôs constellation provides medium-resolution global coverage that enables
researchers, students, businesses and governments to discover patterns, detect early signals of change, and make timely, informed decisions

Canon Electronics Inc.‚Äôs CE-SAT-IIB, was procured by satellite rideshare and mission management provider Spaceflight Inc. The mission objective
for the CE-SAT-IIB satellite is a technical demonstration microsatellite developed with a middle-size telescope equipped with an ultra-high
sensitivity camera to take night images of the Earth and small size telescopes which are suitable for CubeSat use.

I am just an interested engineer with no knowledge of rocket science, but the description is very clear and understandable.
With such information it is possible to learn something new (Paschen's Law). It's a great hobby to watch RocketLab at work :-)

RocketLab can be very happy with the result and look forward to the next Electron missions with great confidence.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Neutron crew capabilities,"Another poster in another subreddit stated that Neutron could put the weight of Soyuz into LEO and it got me thinking.  I hadn't considered that Rockelab could possibly straight up buy brand new Soyuz capsules from Energia to bootstrap Rocketlab's own human spaceflight program.

Russian engine manufacturer NPO Energomash has been selling Russian engines around the world for decades. China's Shenzhou human spacecraft is largely based off Soyuz. So its apparent that Russia has no problems selling their spaceflight hardware and designs to other nations. Additionally, engine sales and Soyuz seat sales are on the decline so Russia's spaceflight sector maybe more willing to do something like selling whole Soyuz to make up the budget shortfalls.

Soyuz capsule has a long heritage of successful work and it would allow Rocketlab to leapfrog into a whole new business of space tourism and possibly even go after future NASA Commercial Crew contracts.  Further cutting development time, there are hundreds of trained Soyuz pilots and commanders that are veterans of spaceflight in a number of government space programs around the world.

Humans get bombed (or not bombed) regardless wether peasants like me buy a stock. I understand that it makes no difference, but still I don't think its moral to invest in stocks that build weapons. So I wanted to buy rocket lab stocks and I am wondering are they planning to make weapons in the near future? Or will they stick to peaceful space stuff?

Edit: With weapons I am specifically referring to bombs or other devices designed to activly hurt or kill people. I am not talking about missiles in general. Also I don't care about it if the rockets accidently crash and hurt the environment. The earth will certainly carry on without us. However I think its immoral to take away life, as in killing humans. Therefor (and thats just personal, not judging investors) I don't want to invest in stocks that build weapons (specifically bombs or WoMD designed to kill humans). Excluding explosives that are not used to harm humans (nuking an asteroid flying towards earth or exploding a mountain to mine diamonds). I just don't want my invested money used to actively hurt other people. However I don't care about espionage, cars and engines that hurts the environment or climate change or something like that.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Rocket Lab generating negative revenue on Electron Launches?,"Hey, so I'm part of a small investor group on Discord which follows space stocks. Recently one of our members [revealed that Rocket Lab is operating electron launches at a net loss](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/998003492503421018/1005151082512662588/IMG_0619.png?width=1200&height=301). He came to this conclusion after digging around in the quarterly earnings reports which report revenues and expenses related to launches and then counted the number of launches in that quarter by referring to Rocket Lab's [completed missions](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/) page. Now obviously, this may not be entirely unexpected for a company that is still relatively new. However, I find the lack of transparency regarding this issue concerning. Investors should not have to go to this level of detail just to uncover that a company is generating negative returns on launches. Obviously, they are generaing revenues from their subsidiary companies as well as the sales of [reaction wheels](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/space-systems/satellite-components/reaction-wheels/) and [star trackers](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/space-systems/satellite-components/star-trackers/). Hopefully, as launch cadence improves and re-usability becomes more streamlined, the company may end up breaking even. Don't get me wrong, I love what Rocket Lab does (it's amazing), but I just feel a little.. annoyed that Peter Beck hasn't stated that they are generating negative revenues from the launches.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Launching Electron from a Mountain,"So with the next launch by Rocket Lab hopefully later today, i thought about if it might be beneficial to have a launch site on top of a mountain. 

For the purpose of discussion lets say you build a launch complex in Hawaii on top of a 4000+ m mountain. There are roads to service the telescopes that are up there, so transport of building material and eventually the rocket itself shouldn't be a major problem.

A launch from up there should give you a noticeable increase in payload capability, since drag and gravity losses should be somewhat reduced. Does anyone know by how much? 

I am also aware of the dangers of such a launch profile. With water nowhere nearby, you cannot easily control your evacuation zone. Espacially on Hawaii, coastal areas will be inhabited and in case of a RUD these people might be in danger. 

But if Electron is proven to be reliable (after maybe ~100 flights), could this be considered as an option for the future if the payload increase is significant enough to eventually justify the expenses for Rocket Lab?

RocketLab_posts.csv,I hope what I'm thinking doesn't happen,"I have a theory about why Blue Origin might finally cancel the launch of the Rocket Lab probes.

It was recently revealed that Blue Origin had applied for a license from the FAA to ship the Blue Moon MK1 in March 2025. (https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueOrigin/comments/1eqf17f/blue\_moon\_mk1\_pathfinder\_net\_march\_2025/)

A few days ago Bloomberg revealed that the hardware of the second and third New Glenn ship had been damaged in internal company tests, if the report is accurate, BO only has a single New Glenn ship tested and ready to fly, with the urgency of BO to demonstrate their lunar rover for missions to NASA while Starship is in development, they may have their internal interests as priority. (https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/08/21/bezos-blue-origin-suffers-fiery-setback-building-new-rocket/)

Let us remember that the probes that Rocket Lab has manufactured are launch class D, low-cost and these can be delayed, since they are not an urgent priority like classes A and B would be.

These are my thoughts, maybe I'm wrong and everything is ready for launch, but if Blue Origin decides in the end that they will not be able to meet the schedule for the window, it is possible that they are considering this path of prioritizing their lunar module since they are very profitable missions that NASA spends a lot of money

Let's just play pretend and all of that is 100% real and all of a sudden some alien race made contact and we got access to their gravitational propulsion technology, and are able to travel between our atmosphere, space, other planets, etc all very fast.

Does Rocket Lab just immediately become obsolete and tank? I suppose even if we don't need launch vehicles like rockets, the satellite components business would still be in full operation and working.

Or maybe it is a massive catalyst in humanity's drive for space and motivation to become interplanetary. All of a sudden rocket launches and satellites are #1, 2 and 3 priority and get massive attention and funding.

To begin with, I think that SpaceX and Blue Origin have some points in common, not only does it have a strong backing of money, but its CEOs are people with certain power, who may have certain ties with politicians, this in some way . may influence certain future government contracts.

As for Rocket Lab, it is a company that comes from nowhere and is making its way with its own resources, this is where I want to remain skeptical, I don't know if Rocket is aware that it can be very difficult to compete directly with these 2 companies in the future, maybe I'm wrong, but I have the feeling that Rocket Lab will eventually focus on offering services like the other startups they mention at the beginning want to do and will slowly abandon rockets.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Why doesn't Electron system use catenary wire supply to rocket during early flight?,"I wonder if RocketLab should use wires to supply juice from terrestrial source to the rocket's pumps during the first few seconds of flight when the engines are working the hardest? (If I understand correctly, space rockets toil almost half of their total work during the first 10 seconds / 500 meters altitude of flight.) Thus the burden on on-board battery packs could be significantly lessened via wire-based electric supply. E.g. how the 1950s era french sounding rocket ""Veronique"" used 4 steel wires attached to its fins (albeit for early flight trajectory stabilization instead of HV AC or DC supply).

The tech is mature, as railway overhead catenary carries 16MW of power at 25kV AC to electric locomotives worldwide and some mining railways even use 50kV AC. As an alternative, 30kV DC has recently been developed, though not yet used in railways (where current DC wire max is 3kV).

In case of 25 or 50kV, 50/60Hz AC supply the electric ""skin effect"" even means most of the juice only flows through the outer parts of the wire, near the surface and thus it could be made hollow, with a super-strong synthetic filament in the middle to provide strenght, while a thin copper or silver skin conducts the current, to keep the weight burden manageable.

Wires on the rocket should also help with proliferation concerns, since the current, autonomously powered Electron seems oddly the right size and weight to be put on a 14x14 all-terrain truck russian style and lofted at your foe from a random location as an IRBM/ICBM. If it depended on wires carrying juice from the grid during the beginning of its flight, implying military un-feasibility, then other launch locations could be more easily authorized worldwide.",15,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/idv0uq/why_doesnt_electron_system_use_catenary_wire/,-0.1298,0.027,0.944,0.029

RocketLab_posts.csv,"Has Rocket Lab ever discussed the possibility of creating an ""upperstage(s)"" version of the Electron, to be sold (especially for NASA probe missions, for ex.) as a cheaper alternative to the Centaur, on other medium/heavy lift rockets? I did some delta-v calcs and the results looked pretty good.","Ideally, they would make it shorter and wider for this version, since it would be sitting on top of the first 1, or 2 stages of a medium-lift or heavy-lift rocket.  

(There could also be a 1 stage version that deletes what on a normal Electron would be the electron's upper stage, or vice versa, I guess, depending what size of rocket they were sitting this thing onto).

One important thing to keep in mind is: the dry mass of what would be the first stage of a normal Electron rocket, would be lightened considerably by the fact that they could probably remove 7, or maybe even 8 of the 9 rutherford engines (remember, it would be being used as a 3rd stage, so, it would already be most of the way, or already in LEO by this point, so, it wouldn't need the full 9 engines on that stage, nor anywhere near it, AND, better yet, that also means you'd get to remove 7/9ths or 8/9ths of battery mass, as well.

And, also don't forget we'd be using vacuum-optimized rutherford(s) for that 1st (3rd) stage electron stage, so we get the 343 isp figure, not the 300ish figure, for the burn.

So considering how light it is, being made out of carbon fiber, and then lightened even further more of a bunch of dry mass from getting rid of 78% to 89% of its engine & battery mass from that stage, its dry weight would be EXTREMELY low, so even when combined with a 'mere' 343 isp, it actually would perform extremely well.  Getting into Centaur performance territory, at a much cheaper price.

The one thing I'm not as sure about is on the technical side, pragmatically, like, is the Centaur easier, or harder to work with, as a high upperstage, during the part where the thing is sitting on the launch pad, and also even during the launch while it is waiting to get ignited like 8 minutes later or whatever?  On the one hand, I would assume, at first glance, that the Centaur is, if anything, *worse* in this regard, having to deal with nasty ole near-absolute-zero liquid hydrogen and whatnot.  BUT, I'm a noob and have no experience with any of this, so, for all I know, it's some counterintuitive situation where because they use a bunch of insulation liner in hydrogen stages, maybe this somehow makes it weirdly easier to use in terms of boiloff or something, compared to a kerolox upper-upperstage?  Not sure.

And there would be the question of how the payload fairing situation would work.  I.e. would they slip basically a shortened, fattened Electron (minus 7 or 8 rutherfords and batteries) literally just into the payload fairing (i.e. of something like a Falcon9 or FalconHeavy, and just have some weird little holes punched into the bottom (down-facing-curve part of the bottom of the fairing to put the tubes into to deal with propellant and boiloff?

Or, would it need to be more like its own more formal stage, with the bottom-Electron stage being its own cylinder-section, so to speak, near the top of the rocket, along with an even smaller one of what would amount to its upperstage, with a little payload fairing sitting on top of that?

I guess it would be simpler if using just the bottom of the two electron stages, for a 3-stage setup, rather than both stages for a *four* stage setup.

And, if a customer was trying to do a New Horizons style mission and wanted to eek out every last drop of delta-V, but didn't want the nuissance of the tiny liquid-fuel Electron uppermost stage, they could just replace that stage with one of those Thiokol 37Y or 48B stages I guess (although not sure if the prices on those are super unreasonable or not, considering those are linked to old-space stuff, and I've never seen price tags for what those cost.

---------------------------------------------

**Some delta-V estimates, if it was used for various F9 configurations:**

Falcon 9 in ASDS reusable mode can put 15.6 metric tons into LEO.

If you were launching a New Horizons type of deep space probe (or maybe a small probe to some moon of Jupiter or Neptune or whatever), and let's say it weighed about 478kg (the mass of New Horizons):

F9 in reusable mode could easily put both stages of electron + the payload with a few thousand kgs left over to spare, into LEO.

And then you'd get a whopping **additional 8,973** m/s of delta-V from the Electron's stages, for about 7 million bucks, combined with the cheapness of a resuable-mode F9 launch (also cheap, compared to the expendable launchers).  (And, remember, I removed 7 out of the 9 rutherfords and 7/9ths of the battery mass, for the lower of the two Electron stages, for my calculations since it's being used as uppstages here.  Aka if your numbers come out a little lower, that's the reason why (I used 35kg per Rutherford and 20.857kg (it was listed in lbs somewhere) per battery; all times 7x on both accounts for a grand total of 391 kgs of dry mass shaved from that stage, from removing 7/9ths of the engines + batteries.

I also did a fully expendable F9 + Electron stages calculation (and shaved about 2,600kg of dry mass from the from the F9 1st stage since no landing legs, fins, etc and turned that into propellant mass), to see how much total delta-V it would give to a 478kg New Horizons probe, and if anyone is curious, it came out to:
**19,705 m/s of delta-V**

Obviously with the Falcon Heavy the numbers get even crazier, by several thousand m/s of delta-V.

For that version if using a small probe, you could go the full 4 stages and get extremely high delta-V, or, you could use only the bottom of the two Electron stages, as the third stage, and leave out the 4th stage, if going with a somewhat bigger probe (maybe a lander that weighs a few thousand KGs, let's say) and get some vastly improved numbers out of, say, a Falcon Heavy in reusable or reusable+expendable-centercore mode, with only a few million extra in added price.

The problem, in regards to specifically the Falcons, is that they are already so skinny, that adding even more height with this would maybe push it over the edge (I think as long as Rocket Lab created a short-and-fat upperstage-use version, though, it would actually be okay (albeit just barely).

And then, not sure if the old-space companies that launch the Atlas (or later on, Vulcan) or Antares or stuff like that would even *want* the discounted upperstage performance or not.  Like maybe they have some special old space deals in place or something where they *must* use a centaur, or what have you, as an upperstage, and specifically NOT try to save money by going this route.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Moat chat,"First off this ain't a DD. This is a motivational wake up to what is actually happening. 


Every month that rocketlab is running, is the moat.


This ain't a 7/11 franchise. This is a business that has all the knowledge and engineering to get to space. Every day, every week, every month something new is learned that gives them an edged. All the layers beyond just a rocket, rocketlab already is refining and gaining new plans and partnerships.


All their previous launches, all that experience, gaining customers, a proven track record, refining, adapting, tweaking, integrating. Rocketlab building parts, building platforms, launching, monitoring, landing, building a process, refining a process.


The amount of experience, retaining customers, providing new experiences and solutions for customers...


...that is the moat. Doing the hard thing, doing it well, and most importantly already doing it. There isn't hopium, there isn't promises, they are already doing it.


Others haven't even scratched the surface of what that all entails. They don't have all the additional staff, processes, customers, solutions, platforms, they are stuck on figuring out step one. They are blowing millions, billions, without even a foundation of a business yet.


Rocketlab is so far ahead that they have a wild tech/intelligence/platform moat that is still far unrealized compared to their stock worth.


I am actually incredibly excited because a lot of this is still to be discovered by others. You really need to grasp how much rocketlab has already accomplished and how fast they are moving on neutron and space systems. Like, this ain't a shop that sells loaves of bread(nothing against a good sour dough, promise). They made a business that escapes the atmosphere, literally leaving the planet to find new opportunities. That is something once only held by the wealthiest and most knowledgable countries. Now we have it from rocketlab, where we individually have the ability, through its stock, to be a part of it. Literally nerd heaven.


Owning some rocketlab stock puts us right there in time, in the history of humanity where we are transitioning to space. Like imagine what you can tell your kids, nephews and neices or grand kids.


The wonderful thing is, you don't even have to imagine, you just do it, and you are a part of all this. Own a piece of this awesomeness. Help make sure it all happens, promote it, champion it. 


I just don't even know what else to say!!! It's so damn exciting.

Ahead of earnings I've been doing some research. I'm fairly ok with this quarter earnings meeting the targets of 98m assuming the space system forecast was accurate. Traditionally they've been pretty close so maybe +/- 1m but overall they've had all successful launches done.

My issue is for the upcoming quarter. Didn't they guide for like 6 launches this quarter? And more so for the entire year it was around 22/24. I really don't think this seems feasible right now. 

A possible downwards revision in launches in the guidance could be bearish news for this stock right? We could take a big hit that basis?

A delay/downwards revision in launches is either due to the fault of customers not having satellites ready to go or just a big lag between when Rocket lab get the electron rockets ready for launch.

The other side is the good news which could be them saying they'd be able to hit the target launches and possible news of neutron.",8,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/1chca1w/downward_revision_for_q2_launches/,0.6149,0.087,0.848,0.065

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5DdP9uvkEs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5DdP9uvkEs)

This will surely be a Killer App for SpaceX's upcoming Starship launch vehicle, deploying their upcoming Starlink v2 satellites into orbit. There will surely be a demand for this type of communication network if it works as advertised, fulfilling the promise of what Iridium was supposed to be.

I was wondering whether Rocket Lab with its own in-house expertise from its family of satellite component builders might be able to come up with a comparable solution as this. Something like that would surely create demand for Neutron's launch services, especially with the rapid launch turnaround Neutron is meant for.

So Neutron obviously won't have a fairing as large as Starship's, but could some of the well-known origami techniques be used to create large unfolding antenna arrays that could snugly fit into Neutron's payload fairing for launch? Elon Musk said Starlink v2 would be using the world's most advanced Phased Array antennae, which could both detect the comparatively weaker signals from cellphones and compensate for Doppler frequency shift. Is anything like that within the capabilities of Rocket Lab or its family of subsidiary companies?

Surely a globe-spanning mobile cellular telecom network would be the ultimate demand-driver for the kind of launch cadence Neutron aspires to.",28,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wzw1lb/can_rocket_lab_replicate_starlinktmobile/,0.9614,0.132,0.832,0.037

# Introduction

With the 2024 first launch of the Rocket Lab Mega Constellation Launcher‚ÄîThe Neutron‚Äîfast approaching, I decided it is high time for a more up-to-date DD on Rocket Lab. A lot is happening in the industry, the company, and the world. I have decided to dive into the future, fundamentals, industry, funding, financials, dreams, and of course, the memes of the aspiring space company. Now, I am posting my DD into both of the Rocket Lab subreddit, as I am new to writing DD and I want to hit as wide of an audience as I can. One disclaimer (for those who do not like stock talk), this DD is not meant to encourage buying of the stock, nor is it financial advice or a stock-only DD, I merely want to dive into this company and simply spark some discussion on it!

Now, Rocket Lab is a private aerospace manufacturer and small satellite launch service provider. The company was founded in 2006 by Peter Beck and is headquartered in Long Beach, California, with additional facilities in New Zealand and Australia. Rocket Lab specializes in the development and launch of small rockets capable of delivering payloads of up to 300 kilograms to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab‚Äîself-designated as a leader in launch and space systems‚Äîis a company that has a chance at becoming a highly profitable giant over the next decade and beyond. In my honest opinion, Rocket Lab currently thrives off of the crumbs of the current space industry ecosystem. With Space X increasingly focused upon one goal‚Äîthanks to their controversial, yet nevertheless, fearless leader‚Äîbeing Mars, Rocket Labs can (and in my opinion will) become one of the go-to space companies for low earth orbit launches in the near term and in the long-term become one of the go-to space company for launches between the Moon, Venus, and Mars as well. Rocket Lab currently lives off of the crumbs left behind by NASA, Space X, and the United States military-industrial complex.

[  Like these two legends from the movie War Dogs, Rocket Lab is determined to become the go-to space company for transporting all types of goods into orbit. For those of you who have not seen the movie \(I personally highly recommend it\), essentially, when these two start their arms-dealing company, they focus upon all of the small contracts that the government is putting out for arms supplies. The contracts that the big players are ignoring, due to their small sizes, even so, these small contracts are worth hundreds of thousands to low millions. Now, this is where Rocket Lab currently lies in the industry.](https://preview.redd.it/j6wloa05vd4b1.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fc5120309359cb8789b861e68009133ef92d376)

[ \\""A new space race has begun, and most Americans are not even aware of it. This race is not \[about\] political prestige or military power. This new race involves the whole human species in a contest against time.\\"" - Ben Bova ](https://preview.redd.it/iliovpg7vd4b1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=f22e8c01f45a403829c6c681966f1a9a53fab213)

Now, before I dive into everything here, I need every to understand that this industry is on the verge of immense change and rapid evolution. We are currently in the first stage of the world‚Äôs Second Space Race. As a student of History, I can confidently tell you that there are murmurings within the historical community, that this is the case, beginning with the creation and success of Space X‚Äôs first reusable rocket: the Falcon 9. On December 21st of 2015, when the first Falcon 9 was launched and the landing was successful with the first stage fully recovered, the race began. In the same way that there is no single company above all others in the airline, shipping & transportation, or car manufacturing industries, is the same reason I do not believe that Space X will alone run the space industry‚Äôs transportation needs. There is plenty of room for companies like Rocket Lab to fill the gaps Space X cannot and in a decade‚Äôs time, there will be plenty of room for even more companies. Yet, there are no companies that are even close to competing with Space X‚Äîother than Rocket Lab‚Äîat this time. Now, I won‚Äôt go deeply into most of these competitors in this deep dive, but to be short, Astra is on the verge of total failure, Virgin Galactic has been playing an entirely different game‚Äîspace tourism, which there is a massive market for, just perhaps won‚Äôt be penetrated by them‚Äîthey likewise seem to be failing. While Blue Origin has been playing a strong game and Space X an even stronger one, albeit more and more focused solely on Mars as the years go on.

[ Here you can see the 1-year charts of Rocket Lab, Astra, Virgin, and Boeing for reference, as you can see, these charts speak volumes. Rocket Lab has been having a tough year but has found a nice bottom and is consistently bouncing from lows in the $3.6-4 range. While Astra has been reduced to a penny stock, with their future unknown. Virgin Galactic is only maintaining below Rocket Lab‚Äôs share price, partly due to the large number of Retail investors that do not know much and refuse to let it die, coupled with a small hope that the company can recover in the coming years. Boeing is here for reference as to what a successful, large-cap company involved in a similar industry \(and the space industry as well\), should look like over the course of a decent year. ](https://preview.redd.it/4lgxhawavd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d24878b2d7dc72b1e5c87ccd01d67c077485001a)

*Now, there are a few assumptions that I am making that we need to cover before diving into the real DD:* Whether it be because we live in the beginnings of a second Space Race (fueled by privatized space companies and the world‚Äôs governments) or because of technological advancement and a rising interest in space, the increase in rocket launches, space development (in Earth‚Äôs orbit, the Moon, and Mars), and the lowering costs of space launches‚Ä¶ it will become exponentially cheaper, easier, and faster to launch into orbit and the industry as a whole will have a massive boom‚Äîakin, in a way, to the industrial revolution‚Äîover the mid-to-late 2020s into the early 2030s. With the mid-to-end 2030s and early 2040s, we will see massive developments in terms of low-Earth orbit manufacturing facilities, tourist destinations, and stations, as well as settlements on the Moon for mining and refueling for greater exploration and colonization of the Sol System as a whole.

Now these are in part assumptions, but I think once one does the research and looks at the fact, all of this is very achievable. Even if it does not occur in this way, you can shift the dates by an additional decade and every time you do, the more likely, easier, and cheaper it all becomes.

Rocket Lab's business model revolves around providing cost-effective and frequent access to space for small satellite operators. The company aims to simplify the process of deploying satellites by offering dedicated launches on its Electron rocket. Rocket Lab operates as an end-to-end service provider, handling the entire launch process from mission planning and payload integration to launch and on-orbit operations.

# Section 1: Rocket Lab Takes Flight! The Electron & the Neutron

[  ‚ÄòRocket Lab is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, complete spacecraft design and manufacturing, satellite components, flight software, and an on-orbit management.‚Äô ‚Äì Rocket Labs](https://preview.redd.it/nbt3cd8dvd4b1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc518b0149113dc115f082394c2b6e8b33e36707)

Rocket Lab's primary launch vehicle, the Electron, is a two-stage rocket powered by Rutherford engines, which use electric-pump-fed LOX/RP-1 propellants. The Electron is designed to optimize cost, flexibility, and rapid launch capability for small satellites. Rocket Lab has demonstrated numerous successful launches since its inaugural flight in 2017, showcasing its technological prowess and reliability. The small satellite market has been growing rapidly, driven by increased demand for data collection, communications, and Earth observation. Rocket Lab's focus on dedicated launches for small satellites positions it well to capture a significant portion of this expanding market. The company has already established a solid customer base, securing contracts with government agencies, research institutions, and commercial entities.

Rocket Labs‚Äîat the time of writing this‚Äîhas had 37 launches‚Äîwith a 91.89% success rate‚Äîdeployed 164 satellites, operates 3 launch pads, and is maintaining 3 Photon Satellites in the Earth‚Äôs orbit. Of the 164 satellites launched by Rocket Labs, they were commissioned to do so by a wide variety of clients, from NASA, Space Force, DARPA, to Canon. Rocket Labs is supported by Future Fund: Australia‚Äôs Sovereign Wealth Fund, Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Data Collective, Greenspring Associates, ACC, Promus Ventures, L One W One Ltd., and Lockheed Martin.

Rocket Lab‚Äôs main rocket, the Electron‚Äîbuilt and operated by Rocket Lab‚Äîhas flown 37 times and been successful 34 times, with only 3 failures. Rocket Lab‚Äôs key areas of business penetration lie in the launch of mid-sized service rockets, the manufacturing of space systems and satellites, and their adept ability to manufacture industrial space parts, applications, and proponents. The latter of which, they are sort of unopposed in terms of competition.

The Neutron‚ÄîRocket Lab‚Äôs medium-lift, mega constellation launcher‚Äîwill be able to launch 13,000 kilograms into low Earth orbit and it will be ‚Ä¶drum roll please‚Ä¶ reusable! The current goal is for it to launch in 2024. It will be designed for not only low earth orbital supply missions, but also deep space missions, and even human spaceflight. It will be fairing a design allowing for full reusability of the first stage and it will be lightweight, being made of Rock Lab‚Äôs own carbon composite structure. The home base for the Neutron will be at the Neutron Production Complex and the launch pad at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility and Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.

[ ‚ÄòThe Neutron Production Complex will be home to a rocket production, assembly, and integration facility, as well as a dedicated launch pad for the Neutron rocket located on the southern end of Wallops Island. The estimated 250,000 square foot state-of-the-art complex will be constructed on a 28-acre site adjacent to the Wallops Island Flight Facility and will include a Launch Control Center, Rocket Lab‚Äôs fifth global operations center for launch activities and on-orbit operations. To support rapid production of the Neutron rocket, current plans for the complex include automated fiber placement robotic production systems capable of laying up meters of Neutron‚Äôs new, specially formulated carbon composite structures in minutes. As a reusable rocket, Neutron is designed to land back on the Launch Complex 3 pad after a mission and from there it would be returned to the production complex for refurbishment and re-flight.‚Äô ](https://preview.redd.it/k592skwfvd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=279742c6d6196d860258d747af98f84e71b71470)

With Space X dominating large-load space orbital flight and transportation, Rocket Labs, in my honest opinion, is where Space X was roughly something like 6-8 years ago. While Rocket Lab intends to compete with Space X‚Äîwhether it will be considered competition in an industry this brand new and small, time will tell‚Äîfor cargo and humans to the low Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and even Venus! Space X and Elon Musk have made it abundantly clear that the goal of Space X is the large-scale settlement of Mars. While later models of Rocket Lab‚Äôs Neutron will be able to go to Mars and Venus, it appears that is not their main goal. In the near term (being the next two decades), they will be looking to dominate the low Earth orbit and Moon market as well as the manufacturing of industrial space parts, applications, and proponents.

# Section 2: The Space Industry & Company Fundamentals

Rocket Lab faces competition from other commercial launch providers, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. However, the company differentiates itself by specializing in small satellite launches, offering a tailored solution for this niche market. Rocket Lab's Electron rocket provides the advantage of dedicated launches and the flexibility to reach specific orbits, making it an attractive option for small satellite operators.

Rocket Lab has raised significant funding through various investment rounds, securing capital from venture capital firms, strategic partners, and government entities. Notable investors include Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Lockheed Martin. The company's ability to attract substantial investment indicates confidence in its business model and growth potential. Rocket Lab operates within the regulatory framework of the countries in which it launches its rockets. The company holds necessary licenses and approvals from government agencies, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Compliance with safety regulations and adherence to environmental guidelines are crucial aspects of Rocket Lab's operations.

Despite its achievements, Rocket Lab faces several risks and challenges. The space industry is highly competitive, and the success of the company depends on its ability to secure launch contracts and maintain a steady launch cadence. Regulatory changes, launch failures, or delays could impact Rocket Lab's operations and reputation. Additionally, the emergence of new technologies or market disruptors could pose a threat to the company's market position

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room, the Quarterly Results. To preface, negative quarterly results mean‚Äîpardon my French‚Äîjack-shit (at least in the short term) for a company such as Rocket Lab, that is looking at penetrating a market such as the space industry. We are going to look at the past four Quarterly Results in chronological order.

**Q2 2022 Report:** Rocket Lab achieved record revenue of $55.5 million, showing significant growth compared to the previous quarter (36% sequential growth) and the same quarter in the previous year (392% YoY growth). Despite the revenue growth, the company reported a negative EPS of $-0.08, indicating a net loss for the quarter.

**Q3 2022 Report:** Another record revenue was achieved, reaching $63.1 million, with a sequential growth of 14% and an impressive YoY growth of 1,093%. The company's EPS improved slightly to $-0.07 but still remained negative. The fourth quarter revenue is expected to be lower, ranging between $51 million and $54 million, as a launch customer's push extends into 2023.

**Q4 2022 Report:** The company's revenue for Q4 reached $51.8 million, showing a healthy year-over-year growth of 88%. The full-year revenue for fiscal 2022 amounted to $211 million, reflecting substantial growth of 239% compared to the previous year. The EPS remained negative at $-0.08.

**Q1 2023 Report:** The revenue for Q1 2023 was $54.9 million. Increasing revenue by 35% in the first quarter of 2023. Revenue from their launch business was $19.6 million, up $12 million from the prior quarter. Their EPS was $-0.08, indicating strong maintenance of their business. The second quarter is expected to show a significant revenue increase, with an estimated range of $60 million to $63 million.

Now, what does this all tell us? Firstly, they were very forthcoming with the quarterly expectations. Something one might think is not a big deal, but considering how a lot of publicly traded companies operate, this is a good thing. In each of their earnings reports, they have nearly exactly estimated their results, showing they are not attempting to mislead investors. The company has experienced impressive revenue growth throughout the reported quarters, indicating strong market performance and demand for its products/services. However, the negative EPS values suggest that the company is still operating at a net loss. From a shareholder‚Äôs perspective, the company's focus should be on achieving profitability and reducing the negative EPS, while maintaining consistent revenue growth. In my opinion, this stock is sitting just below a fair market value for what it is right now, sitting at just over $4, considering they are not fully profitable. Yet Rocket Lab continues to grow its business, making more contracts, and it stands a competitive chance. If they can turn a profit within 2-3 years, I think they will be one hell of a company. With their competitors failing left and right and none finding the success as Rocket Lab‚Äîother than Space X‚Äîthey could stand to be a massive company in a few decades, so massive, they‚Äôre bigger than Earth.

One last financial point to touch upon‚Ä¶ shorting, so here is some data, which is roughly one month outdated due to my difficulty in finding up-to-date information on the company without a Bloomberg Terminal (So, if anyone on the sub has access to a Bloomberg Terminal and would like to add to my DD in the comments, please do).

**Last Record Date:** May 15, 2023

**Outstanding Shares:** 478,660,000 shares

**Float Size:** 262,310,000 shares

**Short Percent of Float:** 9.80% (The short percent of float represents the percentage of shares available for trading that have been sold short).

**Average Trading Volume:** 4,044,396 shares

**Current Short Volume:** 25,710,000 shares

**Previous Short Volume:** 24,630,000 shares

**Change Vs. Previous Month**: +4.38%

**Dollar Volume Sold Short:** $111.58 million

**Short Interest Ratio / Days to Cover:** 7.7 (This ratio indicates the number of days it would take for the short sellers to cover their positions based on the average daily trading volume.).

The short interest in Rocket Lab has increased from the previous month, with a change of +4.38%. The short percent of the float is 9.80%, indicating that a significant portion of the available shares for trading has been sold short. Now, Rocket Lab‚Äôs short interest is relatively low for a company that has had consistent negative EPS and revenue. Showcasing that the big players in markets either A) believe this company will make a massive turnaround in the near future (1-3 years mark) or B) Rocket Lab, due to its size, is thankfully not on their radar. However, that said, the off-exchange short percentage is 57.69%, showcasing that A) public on-exchange short volume is a complete hoax and Hedge Funds, and other big players are beating down on the stock or B) all of this information is completely misrepresented to retail traders on purpose and the entirety of the United States market system is a complete farce.

# Section 3: Future Prospects & Big Moves

Rocket Lab has demonstrated strong performance and growth potential in the emerging small satellite launch market. The company continues to refine its launch processes, aiming to increase launch frequency and reduce costs further. Additionally, Rocket Lab has plans to develop a larger reusable rocket called Neutron, targeting the medium-lift market segment, which would expand its capabilities and market reach. The company has the potential to be the go-to company for low Earth orbital launches in the short term and in the long term, one of, if not the go-to company, for transportation to the Moon, Mars, and Venus.

[  Peter Beck, founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, did an interview last month on his take on the industry and their future prospects. I wanted to touch briefly on this \(you can find the video on YouTube\).](https://preview.redd.it/ced7t9iivd4b1.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=6579fcd100b405f44d1e65fb13cb185cefe6ed76)

Firstly, the video begins with the commentator stating, ""*With the Space Race this week*,"" the Space X rocket, the most powerful ever built, has scrubbed its launch. While Rocket Lab is adding a new service for testing hypersonic sub-orbital launches, being a welcome addition to the company‚Äôs wide array of services. Beck states that it is a very exciting time, stating that ‚Äú*the United States is kind of lacking behind in hypersonic technologies and this is a great opportunity to have high cadence, test flight environment for these payloads to really move forward the US‚Äôs hypersonic research*.‚Äù He goes on to talk about how these capabilities are essentially repurposed from Rocket Lab‚Äôs Electron Rocket capabilities: ‚Äú*We take a standard Electron orbital-class launch vehicle and we fly it in some really unique trajectories to provide these hypersonic trajectories‚Ä¶ it is taking an Electron and making a couple wee tweaks to it and having a great high frequency hypersonic testing platform that hasn‚Äôt existed*.‚Äù Beck goes on to speak on the launch cadence ‚Äú*being on target for 15 flights*‚Äù this year with the fastest turn around this year being 7 days between flights, saying ‚Äú*the machine is cranking and the vehicles are flying successfully and the last flight was a reusable vehicle and we splashed that down successfully and now we‚Äôre kind at the point where we are recycling and harvesting engines and components off of those launch vehicles and getting ready to put them back into service and re-fly them*.‚Äù He continues, stating, ‚Äú*I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm allowed to say exactly, but‚Ä¶ a whole multiple gambit of reused components that are all now re-entering the production line and going back into service*.‚Äù Morgan Brennan, the interviewer then speaks to how there is this emerging mismatch between supply and demand when it comes to the satellite launch market, with the fact that there are so many satellite constellations that are poised to go into orbit in the coming years and not enough capacity in terms of launching them. So, she then asks about the reusability of Electron and the development of the Neutron. Beck states that, ‚Äú*Electron is really serving that market very well, and there are lots of flight opportunities that are sort of just doing its thing, Neutron is the new flight opportunity for us‚Ä¶ 2026 to 2030 timeframe there is a massive deficit in launch and there are lots of constellations that are all really vying for an ability to get in orbit, so we saw that coming and started work on the vehicle and hopefully we can bring it into service in 2024 and really solve some of those problems and take advantage of that market opportunity*.‚Äù

Now, I don‚Äôt have to tell you all that this is very good to hear from Beck and this is very exciting, showcasing that he really believes Rocket Lab can penetrate this market and become a big player in the ever-evolving industry.

**Rocket Lab Making Big Moves Lately:**

¬∑ Bought Virgin Orbit HQ in California, this was a big win for the company, and folk on the sub were very excited to see this happen. Yay! But, sad and unfortunate for Virgin Galactic, which I am sure many of us space enthusiasts had higher hopes for, oh well, not everyone can achieve their dreams.

¬∑ Rocket Lab reached a new Company record of nine launches within a calendar year.

¬∑ Achieved a record of 100% mission success for Electron launches for the year.

¬∑ Successfully launched CAPSTONE mission to the Moon for NASA, including the first demonstration of Lunar Photon spacecraft platform.

¬∑ Successfully deployed two satellites to space for NASA‚Äôs TROPICS mission on the first of two dedicated launches on Electron for the constellation scheduled in May 2023.

¬∑ Secured another NASA mission to Electron‚Äôs 2023 launch manifest with its Starling mission. Rocket Lab was selected by NASA to launch the Starling mission on an expedited timeline due to long delays and uncertainty with the mission‚Äôs original launch provider.

¬∑ Signed multiple new launch contracts on Electron for 2023 for undisclosed commercial satellite customers previously manifested on another small launch vehicle, demonstrating Electron‚Äôs strong position as a reliable and dependable ride to orbit for small satellite operators.

¬∑ Introduced Rocket Lab‚Äôs new HASTE launch vehicle, a suborbital testbed launch vehicle derived from the Company‚Äôs Electron rocket to provide reliable, high-cadence flight test opportunities to support the development of advanced hypersonic systems technology.

¬∑ Announced that the Company will fly a pre-launched 3D printed Rutherford engine on an upcoming mission in Q3‚Äô23, a major step in evolving the Electron launch vehicle into a reusable rocket.

¬∑ Delivered financial results that exceeded the high end of prior guidance for revenue and gross margin.

¬∑ Launched three successful Electron missions in the first quarter for commercial constellation operators HawkEye 360, Capella Space, and BlackSky.

¬∑ Successfully completed the Company‚Äôs first launch from its U.S. launch site, Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2, at the Virginia Spaceport Authority‚Äôs Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on January 24, 2023. The mission deployed three satellites for radio frequency geospatial analytics provider HawkEye 360.

¬∑ Successfully completed the Company‚Äôs fastest turnaround between launches to date ‚Äì just seven days between its 34th Electron launch, ‚ÄúStronger Together‚Äù, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 in Virginia on March 16, 2023, and its 35th Electron launch, ‚ÄúThe Beat Goes On‚Äù, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand on March 24, 2023.

¬∑ Rocket Lab remains the only U.S. commercial small launch provider to successfully deliver satellites to orbit in 2023. Secured a multi-mission contract with Capella Space to launch four more dedicated launches on Electron in 2023.

¬∑ Achieved programmatic milestones for the Company‚Äôs two Photon spacecraft to support NASA‚Äôs ESCAPADE mission to Mars, and for the Photon spacecraft for a Varda Space Industries‚Äô mission to manufacture high-value products in zero gravity. Both Photon programs include Rocket Lab star trackers, reaction wheels, solar panels, flight software, and radios ‚Äì demonstrating the value and strength of the Company‚Äôs vertical integration and in-house supply chain.

# Conclusion: An Ode to Humanity's Future

Rocket Lab has established itself as a leading player in the small satellite launch market, offering dedicated launch services tailored to the needs of small satellite operators. The company's technological capabilities, solid customer base, and innovative approach position it well for future growth.

Those who lived and grew up in the 1960s and 1970s believed that by the 21st century, mankind would be a space-faring civilization. People had a fascination with the unknown. It was embedded in pop culture, in movies like the 2001 Space Odyssey, Alien, and the Star Trek series. But the unfortunate truth is that after Apollo 17 on the 19th of December 1972, mankind has not left low-earth orbit. The American public lost interest, the government cut funding, and the Saturn V rockets were dismantled and replaced by space shuttles in the 1980s (spaceships not even built to leave low-earth orbit). The curiosity and desire to unravel the mystery of the universe are now again filling the hearts of people. Technology is becoming more advanced and cheaper.

With companies like Rocket Lab and Space X, the future is looking bright. We currently live in an era of mass information. One of the hardest aspects of life in the early-21st-century is learning how to filter all this information. The news of the accomplishments of Rocket Lab, Space X, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA), the European Space Agency (ESA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Space Force, are lost in the large volume of collective data. The average person does not believe how close we are to colonizing Luna and Mars; how close we are to becoming a multi-planetary species. If you walked up to someone on the street of New York City, today, and told them that in the mid-2040s, and by the latest, the 2050s, there will be hundreds if not thousands of people living in Earth's orbit, the upper atmosphere of Venus, the Moon, and Mars, the person would dismiss you in disbelief. But the same would have happened if you walked up to a person on the street of New York City on the 19th of July 1962 (before Kennedy‚Äôs speech) and told them that mankind would step foot on the moon in seven years. Companies like Rocket Lab, which will make orbital flight and transportation affordable, will allow for a new era of civilization, one which was only present and dreamed of in science fiction of the past.

[The Earth, as imaged from the Voyager 1 spacecraft, was suspended in a sunbeam, as the interstellar craft exited the Sol system in 1990. Earth is nearly 4 billion miles away in this image. That is us. That is humanity, all of us that have thus far, ever existed. We take to the stars in search of not only answers but in search of a purpose.](https://preview.redd.it/hnr23odlvd4b1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=298a1ee80b0bc5e3dc0ba5c3c61aa6a25c0682c1)

The company also [over-estimated demand for the small launch industry](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/peter-beck-explains-why-electron-may-only-ever-launch-10-15-times-a-year/) and thus is producing Electron rockets at a faster rate than they are being used. Therefore, re-usability currently serves no purpose other than to boost the company's reputation.

RocketLab_posts.csv,A HLS proposal based on the Neutron - Is it even a remote possibility?,"With the news coming out about NASA's search for a 2nd lunar lander for the Artemis program, there is obviously a lot of speculation on the potential bidders. This got me wondering if Rocket Lab could potentially design a Lunar lander based off the Neutron design. To be clear, the Lunar lander will be based on the Neutron. I don't have any ideas about how the launch vehicle for the lander.

I'll admit that my primary reason in thinking on these lines is the resemblance between Neutron and the early Lunar lander concepts in the 1950s and 60s that used direct ascent (For those who have watched it, I am thinking of a lander similar to the one in Tintin).

That aside, here's how I think the design might work, or the modifications that may be required

* The landing legs of the Neutron rocket seem good enough to act as landing legs on the moon as well, and they can also potentially provide some structural integrity to the rocket or serve as structural elements for unfurling solar panels, or pulleys and other lifting mechanisms.
* Within the existing design, the second stage is no longer required and the first stage tanks can be shortened a great deal, with the 7 engines being replaced with fewer vacuum optimized engines.
* The payload bay can be modified to have unfurling solar panels or radiators over a closed cargo/crew area
* With a diameter of about 6 meters and a height of 10 metres or so (assuming a shortened rocket), available for crew/cargo, it should be more spacious than the National team's lander or the Alpaca.
* It uses the same fuel as the Starship, and because of its considerably lesser fuel requirements, a single Starship tanker can potentially fuel multiple trips of the Rocket Lab lander between LEO and the lunar surface.   
Alternatively, a Starship tanker in Low Lunar orbit or NRHO can be used by the Lunar Neutron for refueling, with astronauts transferring into the lander in NRHO. This would enable even more launches with fewer refueling tanker launches.

&#x200B;

A potential issue ( and this is quite a big one if my limited knowledge is correct) I can see, is the endurance of Carbon fibre in outer space.  If I am not wrong, the epoxy used in carbon fibre can degrade over time due to the increased exposure to UV radiation. I understand that there are solutions to work around this problem, but I am not sure how much that would impact the design of the ship. This could obviously be a showstopper for this entire idea if it means that they have to build the ship out of a completely different material.

&#x200B;

Provided that Carbon fibre can be used (or carbon fibre with reasonable modifications), I can foresee a quicker development time for this than Blue's lander or any of the other proposals (except the Lunar Starship). Just like the Starship, Rocket Lab can leverage the similarity between their regular Neutron rocket and the lunar lander and design the lunar lander largely using the same production line, design language and test articles. It will also let Rocket Lab secure development funding from NASA - funding that will be beneficial in the long term as the technical work from the Lunar lander will help a lot with their main rocket as well.

It would be great to see what others think about this idea.",28,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/tnfoh5/a_hls_proposal_based_on_the_neutron_is_it_even_a/,0.9772,0.068,0.91,0.022

 &nbsp;

**Rationale**

* Competitors are aiming for this payload class, Astra, Virgin Orbit, Firefly (1,000 kg), Terra 1 (1,500 kg)  
* MDA, with RocketLab, is building 500 kg satellites, could be launched by RL  
* Gain RTLS [propulsive landing] experience  
* Gain landing leg experience  
* Gain relight experience 
* Retain staff building rockets for potentially more customers
* Use returned boosters to increase launch cadence


 &nbsp;

**Proposing**  

* Triple booster first stage, no staging  
* Double second-stage or single extended  
* Landing legs for RTLS  
* Maybe larger fairing with dual second stage with interstage  


 &nbsp;

**Possible configuration**  

* Triangle configuration of boosters (no staging), with landing legs, nosecone on one of the boosters  
* Inline configuration of two second stages (no staging) mounted on two of the boosters
* 1 m  or 2 m fairing (which would require new molds) plus funky interstage


 &nbsp;

**Discussion:**  

* A triple booster should have enough reserve propellant and thrust to lift the RTLS propellant, legs and account for extra drag.  Either triple-engine landing or dual-engine landing possibilities (depending on landing mass).  
* A dual booster would mean unmodified second stages fastened together, provide thrust needed for up to 600 kg to LEO.  
* A payload interstage would be needed.

What SpaceX has done with Starlink is to visibly demonstrate how commercial space technology serves national security applications, said Peter Arment, aerospace and defense industry analyst at Baird investment bank.

‚ÄúThis helps SpaceX obviously but also helps the entire industry attract investment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe defense spending space is sort of a rising tide at the moment.‚Äù

Before anyone had ever heard of Starshield, other companies in the space industry started making moves to be better positioned to compete in the national security arena.

Commercial launch provider and satellite manufacturer Rocket Lab on Dec. 1 announced it is establishing a U.S.-based subsidiary for defense and intelligence work, including classified programs.

The new business, called Rocket Lab National Security, will have ‚Äúclose engagement with U.S. government customers to understand their mission requirements, which may be dedicated rapid call-up launch, satellite design, build and integration, spacecraft operations or all of the above,‚Äù Rocket Lab spokesperson Murielle Baker said in a statement.

Tess Hatch, vice president of Bessemer Venture Partners, a Rocket Lab investor, said the mood has shifted from a year ago ‚Äúwhen investors in boardrooms were pounding our fists on the table saying ‚Äògrowth at all cost.‚Äô‚Äù Defense customers can be ‚Äúa little lumpy and unpredictable. However, there are massive potential contracts,‚Äù Hatch said Dec. 6 at the TechCrunch Space conference.

‚ÄúWith markets down and maybe commercial needing to push a little more throttle, the diversity of the customer base is so important,‚Äù Hatch said. ‚ÄúThe government is extra helpful for space companies right now when the commercial side isn‚Äôt as efficient.‚Äù",26,3,https://spacenews.com/with-starshield-spacex-readies-for-battle/,0.9919,0.171,0.812,0.016

RocketLab_posts.csv,The Rocket Lab Analysis (RKLB),"This post explains why Rocket Lab is at its current price one of the greatest investments you can make and why I‚Äôve personally invested my life savings in it. Note, this is not financial advice, I am an ape and a moron.üçå

**Intro.**

Rocket Lab is a rocket company that is working on building a reusable medium lift rocket. They currently have a small rocket (Electron Rocket) and have had over 20+ successful launches to orbit and have deployed over 100 satellites.

The company just received funding via SPAC to go public to fund development of its new medium lift rocket (Neutron Rocket) which is expected to complete by 2024. There is only one company that has successfully accomplished substantial reusability of such a rocket which is SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 rocket.

**Why is reusability so important for a rocket?**

Most rockets today launch and the entire rocket gets destroyed. Imagine if a Boeing 747 airliner had to be destroyed after every flight, each ticket would be over a million dollars a flight for them to make a profit, this is basically what we do with modern rockets. Make that 747 rapidly reusable again and again, and the cost drops dramatically. NASA attempted to do this with the Space Shuttle program because of the insane costs of the Saturn V (Moon rocket) but failed because of large scale refurbishment needs. Today however, SpaceX has shown proof that it is possible with their Falcon 9 and many companies are working on following.

**Competitor Analysis**

**Astra** ‚Äì Lead by Chris Kemp does show promise, however by 8/2021, 4 of their first launches failed (Rocket 1, Rocket 2, Rocket 3.0, Rocket 3.1) with only their 5th rocket making it to to space but still failing to reach stable orbit in December of 2020 (Rocket 3.2). Astra will undoubtedly be a big player one day; however, they are currently far behind Rocket Lab and eons behind SpaceX, therefore they are no threat. (2021 Estimated 100 employees, mrkt cap \~2.5B)

**Relativity Space** ‚Äì This newer space company has two rocket designs:

Terran 1 is an expendable small sat vehicle which is expected to launch in 2022, no threat.

Terran R is a medium/large class rocket designed to be reusable which poses a direct threat and is expected to make first orbital launch by 2024. 

Relativity Space has yet to achieve orbit, and while their plans are big, they have yet to prove their capabilities. Talk is cheap in this game, it doesn‚Äôt matter how much funding you have, achieving orbit is incredibility difficult. While they are somewhat a threat, I have no doubt that RKLB will beat them to a reusable medium class rocket by many years. (2021 estimated 400 employees, mrkt cap \~4.2B Private)

**Firefly Aerospace** ‚Äì This is another early space vehicle developer which has a few vehicles.

Firefly Alpha ‚Äì Expendable small sat vehicle, has many similarities to the RKLBs Electron rocket, as of 8/2021 it has yet to launch with the first planned launch by 9/2021. As a small sat non reusable vehicle this is of no threat.

Firefly Beta ‚Äì Essentially a scaled up Alpha medium class rocket planned to launch in 2024, it doesn‚Äôt appear to have reusability designed in but they are boasting to have the lowest cost 8000kg LEO delivery vehicle. No threat, the future of space is reusable not expendable, we‚Äôll see how that goes with an expendable design.

Firefly Gamma ‚Äì 2 Stage medium class rocket designed to have the first stage reusable. Highly similar design as a Falcon 9 or the Neutron Rocket and a direct competitor. Planned test flights to start in 2024-2025. 

While the Gamma vehicle is a direct threat, Firefly has yet to achieve orbit with any of their vehicles. Their funding is dismal and they are spreading their R&D over multiple vehicles which will strain their resources greatly. They should probably scrap their Beta project and go straight to Gamma, regardless, on their current course RKLB will beat them by many years even though they are estimating completion at around the same time as neutron. (2021 Estimated 350 employees, mrkt cap \~500M Private)

**Virgin Galactic and Virgin Orbit** \- Excluding Virgins Galactics commercial tourism vehicle, Virgin Orbit has a small sat deployment rocket which launches off an aircraft at high altitude. This was recently announced to go public via SPAC. This is a non-reusable rocket and poses no threat as an expendable small rocket, they will need to switch to a ground launch vehicle if they plan on designing any larger vehicles that would be considered competition. Virgin Galactics space tourism vehicle is another market entirely and also poses no threat.

**SpaceX** ‚Äì SpaceX is the king of the jungle and king of agile development; they have proven the proof of concept and essentially hold the golden standard with their Falcon 9 that RKLB and all the other companies are pushing to match. They currently have the only reusable vehicle in the market and their costs are a fraction of their current expendable vehicle competitors. SpaceX has since stopped upgrades with the Falcon 9 and focused all of their efforts on their new super heavy class vehicle the Starship. The Falcon 9 is a direct competitor however there is enough room in space for two, Elon has shown interest in the Neutron Rocket and Peter Beck and seems to be supportive and sees the value in competition, mainly since he probably sees them as a little brother. Therefore, unless SpaceX decides to become extremely competitive with the Falcon 9 to specifically spite RKLB‚Ä¶ unlikely, they shouldn‚Äôt be a huge threat. The Falcon 9 will no doubt remain #1 for medium/heavy rockets and take the best contracts, but there is enough room for the Neutron Rocket to get some of the market share.

The main concern here is the Starship. A new fully reusable super heavy class vehicle with its maiden flight coming up fast, it could likely start launching satellites as early as next year. Will a fully reusable super heavy class vehicle swoop up all the planetary demand for launch vehicles and hurt Rocket Lab? It might drive down costs, but I think there is plenty of backlog and demand for a superheavy class vehicle to not be as much of a burden. (2021 Estimated 9500 employees, mrkt cap ~75B private)

**Blue Origin** ‚Äì Amazons Jeff Bezos company is also exploring reusable rockets.

The famous phallic New Shepard rocket is essentially a suborbital vehicle which is incapable of deploying satellites or making it to orbit. 

New Glenn ‚Äì This vehicle is a superheavy class fully reusable vehicle in similar competition with SpaceX‚Äôs starship, expected to launch in 2022. There have yet to be any flight tests, so this timeline will likely be pushed to 2023 and beyond.

Blue Origin has been working with much secrecy until now with their new developments so it is difficult to accurately gauge their effectiveness. Regardless, if they are successful the New Glenn could pose to be a major threat. Jeff Bezos has been publishing many hate articles bad mouthing SpaceX and while their tech currently sucks, it is no doubt that if they make a reusable vehicle, they will be a cancerous and below the belt fighting competition. Jeff has enough money himself to bankroll the operation through development no matter how long it takes, and could even theoretically buy out RKLB in its entirety himself, so Blue Origin remains a threat, only time will tell how serious of a threat they will be.

**Others** \- One odd reality with the big prime contractors and government bodies like Lockheed Martin / Boeing (ULA), NASA and others, is that they are not pursuing reusable vehicles, as clear as it is and how profitable it will be, they have made ZERO attempt to pursue this path. Mainly because it is incredibly expensive, takes many years to see a return on investment, and is incredibility difficult to even achieve. They are likely too large, led by corporate goons with no vision. One reality is certain, short of discovering anti-gravity technology, reusable rockets are without a doubt, the future of space travel.

**Rocket Lab Pros**

Rocket Lab currently holds the second most frequentlu annually launched vehicle in the US (Electron Rocket) with over 20 launches as of 8/2021. They have proven their capabilities and ability to achieve orbit and their agile development with minimal funding and personnel.

They have enough money from the SPAC to develop the Neutron Rocket and still hold many shares should they need more in the future.

Proof of concept has been established with SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9; all they need to do is copy that.

They are led by a hands-on engineer who developed rockets, seems to have a great vision, and doesn‚Äôt appear to be a sellout. Very Elon Muskesque. 

Finally, they have enough name recognition to attract enough talent in the industry to pull in new employees to help develop their new vehicle. 

SpaceX had 4 failures and 1 successful small vehicle launch (Falcon 1) before beginning to develop the Falcon 9, with no name recognition, no proof of concept, and no commercialization of space. Rocket Lab has a thousand times more advantage than they did at the time. No other company is in a better position to design a medium class reusable rocket than Rocket Lab is today.

Photon - Rocket Lab also has a customizable universal satellite system called Photon. This satellite can be customized to any customers needs. The main advantage of this is that many customers are searching for a one stop solution, they don't necessarily want to develop satellites especially if they have never done so in the past, it's likely much cheaper for most companies to pay a well proven vehicle that can be customized to their needs, placed in an orbit they need, and collect the data that they need. Photon and systems alike will make it much easier and cheaper for companies to buy and deploy satellites and you could even theoretically argue a rental model for the future for more common orbits and purposes. My personal concern is the barriers for entry for a system like Photon is much easier (still extremely difficult) to develop than a launch vehicle itself, there are already many companies who have specialized and designed their own satellites who could pivot into this market which could make competition difficult, therefore I focused this post on the ground to space transport system.

**Conclusion**

Based on the above, Rocket Lab is essentially the #1 public company to invest in, that will reach market the quickest and has the best odds. That along with the potential Space Boom and Space Bubble that is yet to come shows that RKLB is an absolute great investment right now for a 10‚Äì20-year investment. With enough hype, it could 10-20x within a year or two. Again, this is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor, I am a moron and an ape, and a man who loves aerospace.

I thought it was (without much cargo) light enough to be on the Neutron. That isn't apparently true. Still. Manned space flight from Neutron sounds like a great goal. Manned flight is still too dang expensive. 

---OP---

SNC has an amazing space plane (Dream Chaser) that is only $50million per launch - which would make it the cheapest overall launch vehicle to date when the initial research and development costs get burned out of that price.

The only problem is ULA's launch vehicle costs $200 million to launch the space plane into LEO.

The space plane is well within the 8,000kg limit.

Dream Chaser is also already contracted for 6 missions to the ISS.

Knowing how behind Blue Origin and ULA are with the BE-4 engines....this makes the Dream Chaser a prime contractual target for the Neutron.

He talked about a company called Rocketlab (which I of course had never heard about) and I have been intrigued about it ever since and actually watched every single video of Peter Beck that I could find.

The investment thesis is as follows:
 - Rocketlab, while being a very distant second place to SpaceX, is many years ahead of the completion, and that as such, the valuation could be very attractive long term
 - Peter Beck is extremely skilled and talented and could be a generational founder 

I have been trying to validate the assumption that Rocketlab is years ahead of the competition (besides spacex)

It has been somewhat of a challenge because there are from what I read ‚Äú100s of startups‚Äù. I did notice though that some guys, including some guys with YouTube channels about space, often mentioned Astra, Relativity Space and Firefly.

Last months I spent a few hours trying to watch the CEOs of Astra space, Relativity Space and Firefly.

The only CEO that somewhat stood out was the one of Firefly. I would say that Chris Kemp from Astra was probably the one who raised my eyebrows the most when he emphasized on the absolute need to do daily launches, using mobile launch pads, even insisted that having the capability to launch within 24 hours notice would soon be in demand from space startups, argued that 3D printing and reusability were unnecessary, and used the failing OEM car industry as a model for Astra.

I also reviewed the CEO of Relativity Space who somewhat reminded me about Astra (as far as making huge claims). All the CEO was talking about was ‚Äú3D printing‚Äù. I also visited relativity space‚Äôs website and was perplexed by claims such as making a rocket with ‚Äú100x fewer parts‚Äù. I also was perplexed by the Terran R Rocket which relativity space intends to design as fully reusable (the company has never gone to orbit and intends to use full reusability??)

I did not get a chance to review Virgin Orbit. I am in general skeptical of Virgin Galactic and Chamath Palihapitiya (every single SPACs that he‚Äôs involved with seems to be going nowhere). I also noticed that many in the community were making fun of Blue Origin.

Overall I would say I feel a little reassured as RocketLab being ahead of anything besides SpaceX, but I do notice though that several people, including people that I follow, frequently talk about companies like relativity space or ABL.

Is there any company that is a real threat to rocketlab - Besides SpaceX? What are your thoughts?

RocketLab_posts.csv,Why is RocketLab the only launch provider with a Photon equivalent?,"Photon is a really cool addition to RocketLab's Electron rocket.

It blurs the lines between being a part of the payload and part of the launch vehicle, in a way it's both at once. From the customer's perspective it must be really useful to have Photon as an option when launching your payload. It can provide extra thrust to reach higher orbits than Electron alone, or it can provide the orbit circularisation burn at apogee, in both cases removing the need for the payload to handle those burns and keeping the final payload mass low. But it's also a communications bus to talk to Earth, has precision guidance systems and star tracking to assist in those final burns, further reducing payload complexity.

I was looking up Photon to make this post and I discovered they've made it even better than I already thought it was. The CAPSTONE mission to the moon last year used an upgraded Photon with an upgraded engine. They're marketing it as a full satellite bus with solar panels and radio antennae for missions to Mars or Venus. I thought it was just the kick-stage for the last little nudge to the correct orbit, I didn't realise it was so capable.

Which feeds more into my question, why doesn't anyone else have a Photon equivalent?

RocketLab's website describes Photon as being ""Vertically integrated with in-house subsystems based on constellation-scale manufacturing capabilities"". Yeah, it's made by people who routinely make and launch rockets, uses known parts and subsystems with known behaviours and capabilities. It just makes sense that the rocket manufacturer can make a really effective satellite bus, especially for customers where this might be their first satellite. I wonder if the customer base of smallsat providers / first launches is why this is relevant for RocketLab but not SpaceX. In theory SpaceX make a bigger and better kickstage/satellite-bus with Draco/Superdraco engines and help people launch more capable satellites. But Falcon 9 is so much bigger that their customers are usually larger and more capable of managing their own payloads. Electron is so much smaller and more of their customers are smallsats / first ever launches and they need to lean more heavily on the launch provider.

It may also be that Falcon 9's second stage has excess capacity compared to Electron's second stage. Apart from Starlink launches very few Falcon 9 launches come within 20% of the max payload capacity so they just use the second stage for circularisation burns or finessing the orbital insertion. Electron can't do that because it's so close to the mass limits and it's more efficient to ditch the second stage mass and use a smaller kickstage for circularisation burns.

But I'm just guessing blind really. I'd like to see SpaceX develop a Photon equivalent for Falcon 9. Or someone else, maybe Stoke or Relativity Space or ISRO.",35,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/176zsgg/why_is_rocketlab_the_only_launch_provider_with_a/,0.9909,0.09,0.897,0.013

RocketLab_posts.csv,Is Rocket Lab's Rosy Outlook a Problem?,"It bothers me that Rocket Lab marketed the #ItsATest launch as a success.  The tone in [this press release](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/latest/rocket-lab-successfully-makes-it-to-space-2/) is very positive and really attempts to downplay the fact that the rocket didn't reach orbit.  There are tons of cheering engineers in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA_8HPsua0c), and no shots of disappointed engineers, or really any indication that the rocket didn't reach orbit.

I understand that they *want* to be optimistic, and *want* to have a success, but this launch was strictly speaking, a failure.  It didn't reach orbit.  Failure is a strong motivator, and I'm concerned by them taking such a rosy outlook on the launch.  They did get a lot of subsystems to work, but in space, you need to get every single thing right, and nothing else matters.  It seems to me like if they fail with a customer sat attached, they might spin it as ""Rocket Lab Brings Commercial Satellite Into Space"", instead of owning up to their failure.

Maybe this will change, and I imagine that this is part of this being the first flight.  It did accomplish many milestones, and I hope that only a complete success is accepted from further flights.  It's just concerning to see Rocket Lab trying to massage the truth so much to get a positive spin on what happened.

Is anyone else bothered by this?",41,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/6ddv70/is_rocket_labs_rosy_outlook_a_problem/,0.9353,0.167,0.711,0.121
RocketLab_posts.csv,Estimating Neutron first launch date based on publicly announced milestones,"Reposting with some updates to assumptions, from a different account for privacy reasons. Calculations haven't changed, and reference data is shown in the table at the bottom.

A little out of interest and mostly out of boredom, I decided to collate some public statements around Neutron development milestones to estimate the delay to Neutron's first launch date. For this, I collected statements from:

* Presentations available on Rocket Lab's investor relations page
* Archived versions of the Neutron page on the Rocket Lab website

This work could be expanded significantly by trawling through videos, interviews, etc as well (but not by me, this was already only mildly less boring than what I was avoiding doing). It is only a very simple analysis, with some large assumptions being made. Of course, these are only adjustments to public timelines and contain no inside knowledge of Rocket Lab's schedules or internal estimates.

Here's a chart of the results up front:

[Chart of Neutron first launch date estimates. The x-axis is the date that the statement of a milestone was made \(either Archimedes first hot fire or LC-3 readiness\).](https://preview.redd.it/gx0p4rpf4mmc1.png?width=3126&format=png&auto=webp&s=f13b2973239623152232b2c6b00da92ff294b353)

There are two different estimates based on two different approaches for each public statement date:

1. Simple Delay - assumes the amount of work after the milestone date remains the same as the original schedule, and adds the delay to the original launch date of 31 Dec 2024. This means that if Archimedes first hot fire is delayed by one year, the first launch date is delayed by one year.
2. Proportional Delay - this assumes that the effort estimates for the whole schedule are off by some factor, and applies that factor to the remaining activities as well. I.e., if it takes twice as long to reach Archimedes first hot fire from project start, it will also take twice as long to reach first launch from project start.

There are obviously a fair few assumptions going into this very basic analysis:

* Archimedes and LC-3 readiness are on the critical path to first launch. This means any delay to either of these is a delay to first launch. None of the calculated dates above assume a delay in both, only one or the other (and all but one is based on a delay in Archimedes).
* It does not account for any ""accelerations"" such as the company throwing significantly more people or money at the program, purchasing more components rather than building in house, etc. It also assumes that any planned ramp up in personnel is included in the original timeline and any other timelines shared publicly by the company.
* It assumes publicly announced dates were the best dates known to the company at the time, and takes them at face value on this.
* These two models for estimating delay are valid.
* When milestones were only listed as being completed in ""Q3"", the latest date in that quarter or month was assumed.
* When milestones were listed on the timeline on the Neutron page (only sorted by year, but in order), best guess was applied for delivery date to try and be most reasonable.
* It includes all delays - including from changing Archimedes architecture and having to redo a bunch of work there.

**What does this tell us?**

Neutron is probably delayed based on the assumptions made here, without a significant change in approach or spend - this analysis estimates to 2026 in all likelihood. This isn't a validated approach to estimating first launch of a new rocket, so you could dismiss it entirely if you want.

I personally think the first launch will be somewhere in between the Simple Delay and Proportional Delay (a bit closer to the Simple Delay) as the company will be trying to accelerate as much as they can to recover the timeline, and the Proportional Delay estimates are therefore extremely conservative. But at this scale, it only takes a few simple mistakes to significantly delay a program, so who knows.

**If you wanted to take this further**

I would recommend two next steps:

1. Add in more information sources (interviews, podcasts, videos, info from Electron launch livestreams, etc)
2. Perform the same analysis for other companies' first rockets that have actually launched to roughly assess the validity or accuracy of the method

Tl;dr - just look at the pretty graph

RocketLab_posts.csv,Is Relativity Space overpromising?,"I acknowledge that this is a bit of a rhetorical question, because RS hasn't launched yet, but that's kind of the point. They haven't launched Terran 1 yet, but they've announced plans with insane deadlines to send a second generation launch vehicle that's going to be as big as Starship to Mars (and beat SpaceX there, no less). Somehow, even though they haven't launched anything, they have enormous amounts of funding and a [pad at Cape Canaveral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_Space#Cape_Canaveral_LC-16). They will be having the [first launch](https://www.spacelaunchschedule.com/launch/terran-1-maiden-flight/) of Terran 1 later this month.

Full admission, I'm biased against RS because I'm invested in RKLB, and RS is a private company which us retail investors aren't able to invest in. If RS is as good as they claim to be, then they would obviously be a threat to RKLB, which until now, has been second best next to SpaceX, and the best space launch investment option on the public markets by far.

At the same time, I see the wild claims that RS makes, and it makes my bullshit detector want to go off. Sure, RS has cool 3D printing tech, but does that really qualify them as rocket designers? Rocket engineering is notoriously hard. Announcing ambitious plans and timelines for a second generation vehicle when you haven't even launched one of your first generation vehicles reeks both of arrogance and of inexperience. It seems pretty obvious that they will want to make many changes to the design of their vehicles and iterate.

Technology wise, I get that they have a cool metal 3D printer, but it makes me cringe every time I hear them say that their technology is powered by ""AI"". To me, that says that the company is relying on buzzwords to lure naive investors that have no understanding of the technology involved. We also know that their rocket is not, in fact, fully 3D printed. I personally doubt that their construction method is particularly cost-effective, but that remains to be seen.

This last point is debatable, but I also feel like the relatively large size of the Terran 1 rocket is an error. It's a fairly large two-stage vehicle. If you've ever used a 3D printer, you know that the time needed to print something increases rapidly with the size of the object. Having a large rocket means that your prints take much longer, which in turn means that you iterate quite a bit slower. RS could have chosen to start by printing a smaller suborbital rocket so they can really test their technology, iterate rapidly on design changes, and then go for an orbital vehicle when they have more experience. Instead they're directly going for a large two-stage rocket and trying to launch it to orbit. If they need to iterate on this, it will take longer and be more costly.

RS is having their first launch later this month. Maybe they'll succeed and we'll all be really impressed that they've nailed it on their first try. Or maybe Terran 1 will blow up, there will be months of delays after that, and we'll eventually find out that RS has more in common with Nikola than SpaceX.",40,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wiex5n/is_relativity_space_overpromising/,0.9524,0.099,0.823,0.078

RocketLab_posts.csv,"I wonder if Rocket Lab has considered making competitor solid-fuel-kickstages vs Thiokol's 37Y/47B kickstages. These are all about mass-fraction, and Thiokol's are made of metal, so maybe Rocket Lab could out mass-fraction them (and/or match them, but for cheaper) via their carbon fiber skills?","So, for a long while now, Thiokol's ""Star motor"" lineup of high-mass-fraction solid-fuel kickstages has been the standard, go-to kickstage to use, i.e. when trying to give a bunch of extra delta-V to a lightweight probe that you are trying to get to a high velocity for a far away destination (i.e. stuff like the Voyager probes, New Horizons probe, Pioneer probes, Parker Solar Probe, etc).

But, I think they also use them for earth-orbiting satellites sometimes, too, to get a bit more (relatively) cheap delta-v during the final phase of the launch to get them into higher orbits that would otherwise require a bigger launch vehicle, but that you can tip over the edge into doability by just adding a Thiokol Star27 or Star37 or Star48 kickstage to payload in the top of a smaller launch vehicle, and thus save a bunch of money overall, from not having to pay for a bigger launcher than would've otherwise been necessary.

For those who are unfamiliar with these kickstages, here is the Thiokol Star motor wiki page that goes into detail and specs about a bunch of these solid-fuel kickstages:

[Thiokol ""Star"" solid fuel kickstage motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_(rocket_stage)/).

Edit: not sure how to get the wiki link to work, since the url ends in a parentheses, lol.  I tried adding a slash after the parentheses in the link coding, to see if that might help, but that didn't work either.  Anyway, if you click on the ""did you mean Star (Rocket Stage)"" link at the top of that page it links to, that takes you directly to the proper page.

Here are some photos (from wikipedia) of what these Thiokol Star-kickstage motors look like, for those who are curious:

[Star 27 motor](https://imgur.com/a/oSQHlIr)

[Star 37 motor](https://imgur.com/a/sd54wSv)

[Star 48 motor](https://imgur.com/a/pr5x4q9)

[Star 48 motor aftermath](https://imgur.com/a/XBnhYyd) This last one is of a Star 48 kickstage motor that failed to burn up in the atmosphere when it fell back to earth, and thus randomly landed on the ground somewhere in the middle of the Saudi Arabian desert.  (Note the facial expression of the dude on the right, btw).

As you can see, the ISP of the best of these (the Star-37Y and Star-48B) are only in the 290s (albeit not bad for solid fuel, but, still, obviously not as high as something like, say, a hydrogen upperstage), but, the idea is that if you get a good enough mass-fraction, you can potentially outperform a stage with a much higher ISP, if your mass-fraction is better than the mass-fraction of the higher ISP stage, by a wide enough margin, if the payload has a relatively low mass but needs a lot of delta-V.  (Mass fraction is the ratio of the fueled weight vs dry weight of the stage).

As you can see, the mass fractions of a lot of their motors are in the 92-93% range, which is pretty high for such a tiny, final stage (the smaller the stage, the harder and harder it becomes to get a decent mass fraction, especially for liquid-fueled stages, as the plumbing and injector gear and wiring and combustion chamber and cooling channels, along with the body and nozzle and so on, all becomes a higher and higher percentage of the overall mass of the stage relative to the mass of the propellant of the stage, which is why these little solid-fuel kickstages start becoming interesting, because they are so bare and simple and minimalist that you can get a fairly high mass fraction even for a very small stage like this).

Cost-wise, as usual, it is pretty hard to find any info on what these things cost, but, from searching around a bit on google, looks like maybe they cost somewhere around 4 million bucks a pop.

Anyway, so, seems like Thiokol makes these things out of metal (titanium, I think?).

So, with how good Rocket Lab has become at making stuff out of carbon fiber in recent years, and how they are able to use machines to do the fiber-laying very quickly and efficiently and (once it is set up properly) cheaply (relatively speaking), and how the solid-fuel kickstage game is basically all about getting your mass fraction to be as good as possible, it makes me wonder if Rocket Lab would potentially have an edge, at something like this.

Presumably they could get the mass fraction of a carbon fiber version of those things to be even better than titanium (I'm not actually sure about this, but, it doesn't seem outside the realm of possibility that it could be the case, and perhaps even by a decent margin) and/or maybe merely match the mass fraction, but be able to do it more cheaply or something.  Or maybe a mixture of both.

Also: keep in mind, the hot fire going on inside the motor doesn't really heat the exterior body (made of metal, or in Rocket Lab's case, would be carbon fiber if they did what I'm describing) for the first 99% of the burn, because the solid fuel, itself, that is inside the casing, basically shields the casing from the fire going on inside, as the fuel burns from the innermost inside on outwards as it burns.  So, for those thinking that a carbon fiber body would be a no-go, because it couldn't handle the heat of the combustion, I don't think that would be an issue.  Perhaps there would be other issues, though, of some other reasons why it wouldn't be good (maybe it wouldn't handle the vibrations as well, or the angle(s) of the forces or something?  Not sure.

Anyway, yea, so, just something I was pondering about I guess.  Curious what you think.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Speculation on the long-term evolution of commercial launch in this decade (with an eye towards heavy lift as well as Relativity Space),"Hey all,

Just thought I'd put this out there as purely hypothetical (borderline tinfoil) speculation on what could happen in the years to come as the commercial launch market continues to evolve.

First off, a fun thought exercise - what would you name a potential heavy-lift launch vehicle that Rocket Lab could develop after Neutron?

Peter Beck has mentioned recently that they have no plans on retreading the rocket development path, but if SpaceX manages to get the Starship system operational this decade and it disrupts the industry like everyone thinks it will, Rocket Lab may be forced to adapt once again.

In that case, after looking at a variety of options, I personally like Hadron^1 the most. It already has name recognition thanks to CERN's Large Hadron Collider. Additionally, the neutron itself is a member of the hadron class of subatomic particles.

So, not only would Hadron be a logical progression from a particle physics perspective, it would also have instant name recognition. Just imagine: ""Rocket Lab's Hadron Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle"" - rolls off the tongue rather nicely eh?

Second, I got to thinking about consolidation in the commercial launch sector moving forward, as an economic downturn looms and we exit the near-zero interest rate environment that led to the previous decade's boom in launch startups. Many executives in the industry ([including Beck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qcHd13G6yQ)) have made public statements about this in the past couple of years.

Other small launch newcomers already have strong ties to large defense primes that may suggest acquisition down the line (e.g. Lockheed Martin with ABL and Northrop Grumman with Firefly)

The only two remaining non-""billionaire funded"" U.S. commercial LV players with significant financial runways are Rocket Lab and Relativity Space.

I've read previous threads on this sub discussing Relativity and the sentiment seems to be that despite the fact that they've yet to launch, they are a competitor worth paying attention to due to significant private investor interest, high quality talent (mostly ex-SpaceX), and potentially game-changing proprietary tech.

Once again, if Starship proves to work as advertised, and/or macroeconomic conditions continue to deteriorate, market participants may be forced to consolidate in order to survive. Precedent is currently being set in the satellite operator space as multi-billion dollar players have begun M&A processes under growing pressure from Starlink (e.g. Oneweb / Eutelsat and Viasat / Inmarsat). While less common, we've also previously seen consolidation in the launch industry, with Lockheed + Boeing's ULA JV, Airbus + Safran's ArianeGroup JV, and Orbital + ATK's merger. Aerojet Rocketdyne's recent tie-ups with Northrop and L3Harris also come to mind. Granted, each of these cases is unique, but anything is possible in this space, regardless of how large or established a company is.

Thus, I see no inherent reason why a Rocket Lab + Relativity merger couldn't be possible down the line, assuming both companies continue to grow and execute at pace. (A major assumption, to be sure!)

I realize this is probably the last thing on either company's mind at the moment but hear me out. Below is a big picture list of observations on both companies, with an emphasis on their similarities and potential synergies:

- Co-location at NASA Stennis for both companies' next-generation reusable methalox engine testing: Both Aeon R and Archimedes test complexes will be located fairly close to each other at Stennis. I wouldn't be surprised to see some degree of cross-pollination between the construction, engineering, and technician staff across both programs
- Both companies are vocal champions of additive manufacturing techniques throughout major components of LV production
- Both companies' headquarters are located just 3 miles away from each other in Long Beach
- Rocket Lab has proven to be a pragmatic, execution-rich organization. Relativity has proven to be a forward-looking, ambition-rich organization. Combining these modalities could in theory lead to an organization greater than the sum of its parts - SpaceX, the current market leader, has both of these elements in spades
- With Neutron, Rocket Lab is optimizing for operational efficiency with partial reusability and RTLS as their north star, whereas with Terran-R, Relativity is leaning on highly novel structures with full reusability as their north star. If Relativity manages to crack the full reusability problem at sub-Starship scale,^2 both companies' tech could combine in a unique way for a joint RL/RS designed heavy lift vehicle (possibly the Hadron as spitballed above)
- Both companies have good design, PR, and marketing (see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2GT204CEVk), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aJ5NPt5fSM), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kwAPr5G6WA), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BhkjEc6Q64), and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Vf3MlbtAs)), which helps excite the general public and attract talent

Curious what everyone here thinks of both the HLV name brainstorm and a potential team-up with Relativity. Obviously there is an extremely low chance of either happening in this decade, but it's fun to think about as these companies race to develop vehicles that will ultimately launch next-gen constellations, commercial space stations, interplanetary missions, and much more.

Footnotes

1. Some alternatives: Graviton, Baryon, Fermion
2. Stoke Space's [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzqhZLgpiv0) also claims to have cracked the full-reusability problem but they are much earlier-stage and have less funding at this point in time. Definitely worth keeping an eye on though.

RocketLab_posts.csv,[Discussion] Will Neutron be able to compete in the 2024 market?,"As probably most people here are, I am excited about the Neutron announcement. But I'm also wondering if Neutron will be able to compete by the time it comes to market in 2024. Let's talk about how the market will look like in the future, please let me know if you disagree with any assumptions I made in this post.

Let's be optimistic and assume Neutron will work out exactly the way they plan to do it. It will be a partially reusable orbital launch vehicle, putting 8 tons into LEO, reusable. It will essentially be able to do exactly what Falcon 9 is able to do now, just with roughly half the payload, and I assume, roughly half the cost.

Currently, in 2021, Neutrons competition would be primarily Falcon 9, as that's the only operational partially reusable orbital launch vehicle.

A Falcon 9 launch is currently sold for around 60 million dollars. There's likely quite a bit of margin in there, as SpaceX does not have any real competitors for Falcon 9 launches currently, so I assume Rocketlab might be able to sell a Neutron launch for around 20 millions dollars. Which would be a great price. So if Neutron would launch now, in 2021, it would be very competitive and force SpaceX to lower their prices quite a bit. That's nice!

But now it's 2021, and Neutron won't launch before 2024. Based on what we know about the development of other rockets, I'd say it's highly unlikely that Neutron will actually launch in 2024, it's likely a ""Q4 2024"" date estimate, so it will become at least 2025, around 4 years from now, and even that would still be optimistic.

The main competitor for Neutron in 2025 will not be Falcon 9 any more, SpaceX likely plans to not even fly any Falcon 9 any more by 2025. The main competitor will be Starship from SpaceX, a fully reusable launch vehicle. SpaceX aims to have a Starship launch cost around 2 million dollars (https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-flight-passenger-cost-elon-musk.html). That's operational costs, so it won't be the price SpaceX sells it for, let's assume that will be 5 million dollars. 4 years is a lot of time for SpaceX to optimize their Starship architecture for lowest possible launch price, after all, Starship was supposed to reach orbit in 2020 already, and it's highly likely they will reach orbit with it in 2021. It won't immediately be as cheap as they hope, but if they can't get the cost down to what they plan by 2025, something would have to go majorly wrong with SpaceX plans I'd say. So betting against them being successful sounds like a dangerous bet.

So in 2025, there will likely be the options of 

- Launching 8 tons into LEO on a partially reusable Neutron for around 20 million dollars

or 

- Launching 100 tons into LEO on a fully reusable Starship for around 5 million dollars.

Starship will also be able to have a significantly higher launch cadence, as SpaceX won't have to build a new second stage for every launch, which Rocketlab will need to do. 

Would there be enough customers who will pick Neutron over Starship?

One reason to pick Neutron which I can think of would be because you're working on some kind of satellite constellation which you have to launch, and you don't want to finance your main competitors (Starlink from SpaceX, Kuiper from Amazon) with your own launches. Building satellite constellations costs a lot of money though, and not many companies will try to do that. Creating a new satellite constellation in 2025 might be too late to even get into that market, as both Starlink from SpaceX and Kuiper from Amazon will be very operational by then, and Amazon will also always prefer to launch on New Glenn, which will also be operational by 2025. But if there's a major satellite constellation being built after 2025, and the company who builds it does not want to finance their main competitors (SpaceX and Amazon) with their launches, they'll likely pick Neutron for their launches. So that's good for Rocketlab.

But apart from that, is there anything else where Neutron will be very competitive, and not in danger of being overshadowed by the fully reusable launch architecture that Starship offers? Once someone has a fully reusable orbital launch vehicle, it will be very hard for anyone with an only partially reusable launch vehicle to compete.

RocketLab_posts.csv,I dont understand why Neutron are going to be human-rated,"Beck said under the announcement that it is very exciting that Neutron will be capable of human spaceflight. However, I dont see why this will benefit Rocket Lab. I have three reasons why  


1. ISS will planned to de-orbit within 10 years.  In a optimistic time frame will Neutron not be able to carry any humans within 5 years and after all will SpaceX  be very hard to compete with once this is done. 
2. Intercontinental Human Transportation. It is probably a market of billionaires which wants to fly. However, Rocket Labs vision is to make  space commercially viable and more accessible. But is this the way to go? As far as I understand given the size of the vehicle, the maximum amount of passengers in a flight will be approx the same or less as dragon which means it will be fairly expensive for each seat. In my opinion is that not so commercial and accessible. 
3. Very expensive, risky and time consuming to make a human-rated spacecraft. It takes years with testing and if anything explodes during a human flight the company will be bankrupt  (or close to) immediately.     


Neutron will probably be a great medium-lift launch vehicle for satellites, but I am not sure spending time making it human-rated will benefit the team.

 - Massive 60 % expansion of headcount at rocketlab
 - Rocketlab has 0 experience in solar panels construction
 - Massive distraction on top of the many challenges the company already faces

 - add a massive market meltdown
 - runaway inflation, which likely is going to be a big deal when selling something manufacturing intensive with 5 % gross margin

RocketLab_posts.csv,Idea to make the photon spacecraft more enticing,"**Hello fellow RocketLab fans,**

i am not the brightes star in the system, so i humble ask you for critique and feedback for my ideas.

&#x200B;

**Basics:**

As far as i understand it, the two most prevailing problems with satellites are the following:

1. Running out of propellant for orientation and/or maneuvering in space: When a satellite runs out of propellant for their main engine or for its maneuvering thrusters it becomes a danger for other spacecraft and needs to deorbit or it just cannot be used for its original purpose anymore.
2. The reaction wheels stop working: Reaction wheels are one of two means to orientate the spacecraft in space. If they stop working, the only left means of orientation are the maneuvering thrusters, which depletes the propellant even faster. Surprisingly this is a common problem for a lot of spacecraft which fly longterm in vacuum.

To put it in a nutshell, most satellites are not limited by the longevity of their sensors or mission specific hardware, but bc of both outlined problems. This is a big problem for the owners of satellites, bc they need to replace them despite of their core functions still working. This is a huge concern and cost factor for anyone operating longterm space hardware in orbit.

&#x200B;

**Upgrade for the longevity of the photon hardware:**

RocketLab wants to promote the photon hardware as a base satellite, on which customers can add whatever their needs desire. This is a huge sellingpoint, bc most customers don't want to build and operate the base functions, but only their mission specific sensors. But this solution does not solve the former outlined problems of longterm spacecraft in orbit. So my solutions are the following:

1. RocketLab should add a fueling port for whatever the maneuvering system is using to operate. This allowes the photon base to be fueled in orbit, if the need arises.
2. RocketLab should use modular reaction wheels which can be removed and added easily while in orbit.
3. Rocketlab should operate a refuelable maintenance tug in orbit which is capable of refueling the upgraded photon satellites and remove/add said reaction wheel modules.

With this setup, Rocketlab has an offer for its customers to keep their hardware in working order and extend the longevity of their satellites. In addition the vertical integration of Rocketlab allows them to generate additional revenue maintaining satellites and constellation with limited cost. This would make the the photon way more competitive for singular solutions and constellations.",15,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/ppbllq/idea_to_make_the_photon_spacecraft_more_enticing/,0.926,0.088,0.857,0.055

I will now explain why I believe Rocket Lab will design its own manned spacecraft, and will not use Soyuz spacecraft.

&#x200B;

\-Rocket Lab has recently announced that they plan to deliver cargo around the world, (sort of like E2E).

So obviously they will design a re-entry vehicle...then they could adapt it for the manned missions they have announced.

\-If Rocket Lab were to buy a Soyuz capsule, they would be using Russian technology... and there are problems with Russia.

They would also be wasting money if in the future they want to build their own capsule....

And there are many other factors...

\-The Starliner can't be launched on Neutron in the reusable version, and besides, the starliner doesn't even work lol....

\-In the future there will be several space stations, and RL will not be left behind.

Also, for now Europe doesn't have its own spacecraft, the Susie spacecraft is under development, and according to what ArianeGroup has announced, operational flights will arrive in 2030.

So RL could develop a capsule or support body to sell seats to Europe.

\-The small spacecraft could also serve as a reusable second stage and RL would have a fully reusable multipurpose vehicle.",43,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xivd25/rocket_lab_will_design_its_own_crewed_spacecraft/,0.6594,0.062,0.895,0.043

I am a dual Canadian-US citizen and I'd like to apply for an internship at rocket lab and I had a couple questions:

1. I looked on the website and I can't find any postings for internships? It seems like all of the positions are full-time, can someone redirect me to the summer 2019 applications?

2. Has anyone here interned there before? What is it like?

3. What are they looking for in an intern? All of my experience is in software engineering (degree and previous internships) and I was wondering if they accept software engineering interns.

Black Sky's satellites have a 3 year lifespan. Which is great for repeat business. (Star Link's satellites have a 5 year lifespan).

I look forward to someday quantifying an average lifespan per small sat and thus determine how many launches are needed just to maintain the infrastructure.

[https://space.skyrocket.de/doc\_sdat/blacksky-global.htm](https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/blacksky-global.htm)

Regarding Black Sky - they provide a need for 7 launches a year for RKLB. If the price of RKLB launches is about $7million then that is $49 million per year just from Black Sky.

They are both linked to the blue-origin. And Kuiper was contracted to the ULA for 9 launches but noted it will continue to explore all option for launching the remaining satellite.

I know that Blue Origin is owned by Jeff Bezos but Kuiper also contracted with ULA so I assume RKLB still has a chance to win those contracts. I will be very grateful if anyone here can share some info about the competitiveness of RKLB to ULA and Blue Origin and how they differ to each others.

I am greatly interested in possibly getting an internship at RocketLab.

From what I was able to find on the internet such internships exist, however, there are two potential problems that I am aware of. First, I am an EU citizen, but not US or NZ citizen (which as far as I know could disqualify me or at least complicate the process). Secondly, I am currently finishing high school and about to enter higher education in the field of aerospace engineering. In most cases internships are aimed at undergraduate students, however for example last year I completed a short internship at a GE turbojet testing lab, so it isn't always a problem.

So basically, where/when should I apply, and am I even eligible for such application?

&#x200B;

The point being, developing a successful rocket company is damn hard and many have closed up shop trying. What SpaceX has done to initiate this ""new space"" race is remarkable. What Peter Beck has done with Rocket Lab is also pretty damn remarkable considering where he came from and the fact that New Zealand had no space industry really to speak of.   

Investors are going to have to pay a premium to invest in a rocket company that is currently successful and is generating revenue now. Not all of the companies on this list will make it, and there are many more out there that are joining the game. So let's appreciate the ones that are already successful at this point.  

**Here's an analogy I like to use when people say that you should invest in Astra before Rocket Lab because they have half the valuation**: 

Why does Kevin Durant (small forward for the NBA's Brooklyn Nets) make $41M in the 2021-2022 season, whereas Cade Cunningham (#1 2021 NBA draft pick for Detroit Pistons) only gets paid $8.4M. Cunningham is an awesome basketball player and may one day be a max-deal player like Kevin Durant, but as of right now, he hasn't played a single game in the NBA. He has the potential to be great, but until he gains experience and proves himself, he's not as valuable to his team as Kevin Durant is to the Nets (or Team USA for that matter). Rocket Lab is Kevin Durant and Astra is Cade Cunningham in this analogy if you haven't put that together at this point. I do believe Astra will be successful in a couple of years, but there is no denying that Rocket Lab is 4-5 years ahead of Astra, and with the expansion of Rocket Lab's business into space systems and satellites, I think they widen the gap further between them and their competitors, while hopefully also narrowing the gap between them and SpaceX, the latter being the clear leader right now by a long shot.

&#x200B;

**Disclosure**: This is not financial advice. Invest at your own risk. I am invested long in Rocket Lab and Astra, but more heavily in Rocket Lab because of their multi-year track record for success.

RocketLab_posts.csv,RocketLab is officially American??,"I was looking up orbital launch statistics on Wiki and it had a graph of launches per country and RocketLab launches from New Zealand were included in the USA column. 

I checked and RocketLab was founded in NZ by a New Zealander then he moved the company registration to California but continues to operate the business in New Zealand. 

In theory this could be a tax thing like Amazon's head office is probably an uninhabitable rock off the coast of Iceland so they pay zero tax to anyone. But if it was then why pick USA as a tax haven instead of a dozen better choices. 

I wonder if it's because of that US military regulation about missile technology. That's why SpaceX can only hire US nationals to work on rockets but Tesla can hire anyone from anywhere. Maybe to be allowed to launch NASA payloads they needed to be classified as a US Business or something?

**Reused Rutherford Engine Successfully Flies on 40th Mission!** 

You   read that right! On August 24 (NZST), we successfully launched our  40th  Electron mission, called ‚ÄúWe Love the Nightlife,‚Äù for Capella  Space.  Not only did we deliver Capella‚Äôs satellite to orbit, but we  also  demonstrated some significant milestones in evolving Electron into  a  reusable rocket.¬†

For  the  first time, we reused a Rutherford engine that had previously flown  on  our ‚ÄúThere And Back Again‚Äù mission in May 2022. The engine worked   flawlessly on its second flight as it took Electron to space. Then the   first stage returned to Earth with a successful ocean splashdown in the   Pacific Ocean.¬†

Hot on the heels  of ‚ÄúWe Love the Nightlife,‚Äù we‚Äôre launching another  dedicated Electron  launch for Capella. The ‚ÄòWe Will Never Desert You‚Äô  mission is scheduled  for lift-off from Launch Complex 1 as soon as 19  September. The  mission will be our third launch for Capella this year ‚Äì  we're on a  roll! ¬†

* BlackSky,   a leading provider of real-time geospatial intelligence and global   monitoring services, which has launched on six Electron missions since   2019, [signed a block buy deal for five Electron launches](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=85cc888a2e&e=56a66a2a9a)   for their Gen-3 satellites beginning in 2024. Fun fact: BlackSky has   used Electron as a launch vehicle more than any other single commercial   customer!¬†¬†
* A new, double-launch deal with NASA to deliver their climate change research-focused mission, [PREFIRE](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=45378f0d66&e=56a66a2a9a),   is now scheduled to launch in May 2024. NASA's PREFIRE (Polar Radiant   Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment) mission will help close a gap in   understanding of how much of Earth‚Äôs heat is lost to space, especially   from the Arctic and Antarctica. This will be our 7th and 8th mission  for  NASA since 2018. (Graphic we made of 2 launches)¬†¬†

Rocket Lab has been launching   for Synspective since 2020 when the Company deployed the first  satellite  in Synspective‚Äôs synthetic aperture radar (SAR)  constellation. Since  that first mission, Rocket Lab has been the sole  launch provider for  Synspective‚Äôs StriX constellation to date,  successfully deploying three  StriX satellites across three dedicated  Electron launches¬†

Rocket Lab Wins Industry of the Year Award for Stennis Location

Rocket Lab received the prestigious [Industry of the Year Award](https://rocketlab.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7445e59ae2ac01e53232ff41b&id=42323fcd30&e=56a66a2a9a)   at the Hancock Chamber Business & Industry Awards Gala in August.   The annual awards recognize outstanding achievements in citizenship,   industry and business in Hancock County, Mississippi. ¬†  
We opened our  facility at the Stennis Space Center in 2022 and the site  will be used  to test the new Archimedes engines for the Neutron rocket  coming in  2024.¬†

When   we expanded our Space Systems division, we created a vertical   integration strategy where we could build essential elements of a   spacecraft for our own satellites and those built by others. The idea   behind this was everything going to space should have a Rocket Lab logo   on it!¬†

Speaking of‚Ä¶¬†                                      **NASA Psyche Mission** 

NASA‚Äôs  Psyche mission, which will orbit a metal-rich asteroid of the  same  name in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, is  scheduled  to launch in less than 30 days on 5 October 2023! ¬†

The spacecraft will use a huge Rocket Lab solar array that will power the spacecraft during its 4-billion-kilometer journey.¬†

**MethaneSAT Mission** 

MethaneSAT,  scheduled to launch no earlier than January 2024, is an  Earth  observation satellite that will monitor and study global methane   emissions to combat climate change. We are providing multiple elements   to make this mission a success including developing the Mission   Operation Center, the solar panels to power the spacecraft, and the   separation system that will eject the satellite to its orbit. This   mission is jointly funded and operated by the Environmental Defense   Fund, an American NGO, and the New Zealand Space Agency ‚Äì the country‚Äôs   first space science mission! ¬†

**Neutron Update**

Neutron,   our mega constellation launcher, continues its development on  schedule.  We‚Äôve now begun Stage 2 tank testing including cryogenic fill  and  pressure cycles to determine structural and sealing integrity and   performance, hydrostat test to prove the structural integrity of the   structure, domes, and hatches, and the fill, press, vent and de-tank   systems and procedures among other structural tests.

Our engineers are hard at work making Neutron a reality!

Space is a big place. There is room for both. And for those astronomers who claim that it causes light pollution, I argue that it has no lights onboard. The only way to see it is from reflected sunlight. And when it is on the night side of Earth it won‚Äôt be reflecting any sunlight because it will be in the Earth‚Äôs shadow. The only chance you will have of seeing it at all will be around sunrise or sunset. And remember that all satellites reflect sunlight (even the science ones). Airplanes on the other hand do have lights onboard and are visible at night but astronomers don‚Äôt seem to be complaining about them. For those who claim that it is simply more space garbage, be aware that it was placed into an orbit that will cause it to burn up in about 9 months. So it cleans up after itself. And for those who will then claim that it‚Äôll still be ‚Äò9 months of space garbage‚Äô I say the following: Instead of the thousands of evil spy satellites that are up there continuously taking our picture, Humanity Star is peaceful. Nobody is making money off of it. It can be experienced by almost everybody on the planet. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre rich or poor. It doesn‚Äôt matter what language you speak. It doesn‚Äôt matter what skin color you have. It has the power to touch us all and make us smile.

RocketLab_posts.csv,"Rocket Lab's path to Profitability: Increasing SolAero Gross Margins, Electron Recovery, and Responsive Launches","In Rocket Lab's [earnings call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE) yesterday, they made some very interesting statements about how the company plans to increase gross margins and achieve profitability.

First, Rocket Lab [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE&t=2622s) that increasing gross margin on AolAero is the best thing that they can do to improve profitability on the Space Systems side. Rocket Lab said that they have a 24 month plan to increase SolAero gross margins from ""high single digits"" to a whopping 30%! They said that they are very confident in this plan, and that executing on it is only a matter of time. Rocket Lab said that revenue from the acquired companies SolAero, Advanced Solutions Inc, and Planetary Systems Corporation was $28M in Q2 2022, and the vast majority (> $20M?) was from SolAero. Therefore, increasing the gross margin to 30% on SolAero revenue is a really big deal!

Secondly, Rocket Lab [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW5pt9khkLE&t=3102s) that for their new [Responsive Space Program](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-introduces-responsive-space-program/), the cost per launch is 15-30% higher than the typical Electron launch price of $7.5M, and the vast majority of that 15-30% markup goes directly to gross margin since most of their launch costs are fixed costs. Between Electron reuse (70% of cost is in the first stage) and responsive launches, I see a clear path to increasing the gross margins of Electron!

These statements really help to paint a clear path to profitability in my mind. With stronger than expected revenues and a clear path to profitability, it‚Äôs no wonder that Rocket Lab stock surged over 20% today. What do you guys think? What do you think Rocket Lab's plans for SolAero are? Increasing automation? Integration of solar panels into other components? Outsourcing of manufacturing? I sure hope it isn‚Äôt outsourcing, the United States really needs to manufacture its own solar panels.",72,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/wmsfbg/rocket_labs_path_to_profitability_increasing/,0.9784,0.17,0.755,0.075
RocketLab_posts.csv,12 years later and some thing's never change...,"
...and some thing's only get better.

Twelve year's ago Peter Beck and Rocket Lab first touched space with Atea 1, a sounding rocket that was never designed to go orbital.

Then a few day's ago Beck and the Rocket Lab team set a new company record for fastest turnaround between orbital launches. 21 days!

It's no surprise to see Becks instinctual celebration has stayed the same.

In this [video](https://youtu.be/ETEWnRsa_Ik) you'll see the launch of Atea-1. The first Rocket built by Beck and the early engineers at Rocket Lab as a private company. They started with resources provided by Mark Rocket and Sir Michael Fay. Let me get ahead of you, you're going to see and hear some funny stuff. A last second delivery to Beck from a helicopter(no wonder he likes them so much). You'll also hear a guy say ""did it go?"" Judging by Beck's double fists in the air, it go'd. The tracking components they used were faulty, so it was never found. But being a sounding rocket you get literal evidence. 

I noticed a familiar double fists in the air during the last launch. Late in the stream a curly haired figure steps in to check if both satellites deployed nominally. Go to [1:13:45](https://youtu.be/PmCl2Hs8enc) and tell me I'm wrong.

Both these rockets are mainly built with carbon fiber. I have heard Beck say he only uses carbon fiber. First stage, second stage, fuel tanks, wherever he can. I don't know how they get the fuel tanks to work, but they do. 

So now here they are twelve years later with a wealth of knowledge on launching rockets to orbit. Working with the same material the whole time. Then learning how that material reacts on re-entry. I wrote this because I want to hear some discussion on the future possibilities of ""Rocket Lab Carbon Fiber.""

I think that was part of the hardware we got with the Neutron Presentation. I don't care that it wasn't bolted  down, or that it was at room temperature. A falling rocket isn't bolted down. So was the i-beam the one way to mimic forces from hypersonic waves? The fact they are sticking with CF makes me realize they are trying to learn from modern airplanes to make the modern day rocket. Two more things that weren't physical hardware, but interesting concepts were the fairings, and the suspended second stage. Sure the perfect end would be Beck stepping into some fairings that close....but whatcha gonna do

I'm trying to get a better understanding of composite materials and found [this old lecture](https://youtu.be/V7bX4c9XWes). I didn't make it through the whole thing, just the first part before the more technical discussion. He brings up a key advantage is ""tailorable anisotropy"", I was wondering how that could help in Neutrons design? As well as the ability to manipulate the overall process so many different ways. What do you think the limits are of the chemistry of the resin? 

I thought this professor did a great job in the early part of the lecture. He made it fairly easy to understand. It's also seven years old and he's talking about getting his own automated fiber placement machine. So that technology must be further along.",73,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/re8re1/12_years_later_and_some_things_never_change/,0.9865,0.091,0.879,0.03

RocketLab_posts.csv,Is Rocket Lab actively pursuing SMART reuse technology?,"Tl;dr the economics, development path, and direct incentives of SMART bode well for Electron, and it appears hardware is already in place (see linked photos).

Hi /r/RocketLab,

While we're waiting for the *Still Testing* campaign, I thought this would be a good time to discuss this. I was going about my life today, thinking about spaceflight at work, and more specifically, the design and economics of Electron.

Before we get into it, it's clear that the cutting edge of commercial spaceflight is largely focused on reusability ([SpX](https://i.imgur.com/TN3BMsK.jpg), [BO](https://i.imgur.com/q7L3fTD.jpg), [ULA](https://i.imgur.com/wSkwzqD.jpg), [ESA](https://i.imgur.com/I9aTUWE.jpg)). Why throw your expensive rockets away after every flight? Obviously, it takes *enormous* resources to develop an orbital rocket, and even *more enormous* resources to develop reuse. For that reason, SpaceX remains uncontested in this arena. There are many ways to save money through reuse, however, and each have their own pros and cons.

Vertical self-propelled landing is obviously great because you recover the whole booster (I'll be ignoring second stages in this post). Another advantage for SpaceX is that're getting good at large-scale vertical rocket landings for their future launch vehicles. The disadvantages of this approach are that vertical landing an orbital rocket is *extremely* [difficult to do](https://youtu.be/bvim4rsNHkQ) and requires an *insane* amount of developmental resources. I love SpaceX and how incredibly lean they are, but the amount of money that even they spent to make Falcon 9 reusable will probably [never directly pay for itself](https://np.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/7kzabd/dr_spacex_or_how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and/) by recovering boosters. Plus, a vertically-populsively-landing vehicle has to be specifically designed for re-entry and the vertical landing process, cutting deep into payload margins. Operational costs of recovery, vehicle processing, and re-checking the whole rocket eat further into the profit margin. All-in-all, I don't believe this strategy would be viable for a small vehicle like Electron, and a young launch provider like Rocket Lab.

[ADELINE](https://youtu.be/tV29pEvZvZw) is another concept proposed by ESA where the rocket's engines (by far the most expensive part) pop off the booster and fly themselves to a nearby runway. This approach could be much cheaper than trying to revamp the whole vehicle to land vertically. Electric motors could draw power from the already-existing batteries, and wings/RCS wouldn't be terribly difficult to add. Some major problems with doing this with Electron are: where would it land? This would likely need a long runway within a fair distance to its re-entry area. Additionally, reentry would be around Mach 7. That complicates things *a lot*. So maybe ADELINE isn't the best strategy for Electron.

[ULA's SMART concept](https://youtu.be/lftGq6QVFFI), however, may be perfect for Electron. It adds minimal mass by eliminating the need for RCS by having a passively-stabilizing shape when deployed. It would only add the mass of a small, Electron-sized steerable parachute, re-entry shield, and separation system. Remember, [this really is a tiny $1M+ engine cluster](https://i.imgur.com/ffLJ6vz.jpg) we're talking about. As added booster mass doesn't tax the payload capacity nearly as much as anything on the second stage (8:1?), a lightweight hardware set along these lines could be technically feasible. As for the cost to recover, a fast helicopter could be purchased or chartered for mid-air capture and bring it directly back to Mahia or their HQ in Auckland. Or maybe a cheap plane could even be used in conjunction with some sort of ground-based capture system (or just reel it up to a mounted hardpoint on the plane under the belly). The (likely inflatable) re-entry shield would be pretty light too (again, think about how small of a vehicle Electron is) and some pretty off-the-shelf parachute gear could probably be used. Who knows, maybe an employee already has a plane that could be used to cut costs further. Or, since this engine pack is so small, maybe the inflatable reentry shield could function as a raft, assuming it's shaped well enough to keep water out. That would also eliminate the need for parachute steering, and could be picked up by boat. Surely someone at Rocket Lab has a boat. Anyway, I'm not going to go further into the design, as it's clearly within the realm of possibility.

Rocket Lab has said their Mahia launch site can support a launch every 72 hours (even wording that [""120 launches per year""](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/launch/launch-sites/) on their website) so clearly they want to launch a lot. Is throwing 10 engines away every flight really viable with a cadence like that, when reuse is an option? SMART reuse would really help eliminate the potential bottleneck of engine production for a pretty small cost.

Now, when I thought about this today, I thought that Rocket Lab was *probably* not pursuing reusability with Electron, because they have enough on their plate. Plus, an Adeline concept would be visible from the exterior of the rocket, and a SMART system probably would be too. Adeline would have static or fold-out wings, and SMART would probably need four sections (probably along the outer edge of the rocket) to either fire pyro bolts or extend pneumatic pistons. It'd also need a little bit of space in the mini-interstage to tuck a parachute and heat shield. I remember the press photos, specifically that the [entire exterior of the Electron is smooth](https://i.imgur.com/vb8dcrj.jpg) so that puts that idea to rest. Except, after looking at a couple photos of Electron, it turns out [that's not the case](https://i.imgur.com/RtC01FN.jpg).

On their [website](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/electron/), it shows the Electron with not only [unnamed hardware](https://i.imgur.com/ZnzHwTv.jpg) in 4-way symmetry, but what looks *suspiciously* like a small interstage. The large 4-way-symmetrical parts on the bottom of the rocket body are hard points for [hold down](https://i.imgur.com/Y2NiZFX.jpg) during launch. But the devices right above it look a *lot* like stage separation mechanisms. The symmetry is right, they *look like* some sort of stage attachment/detachment mechanism, and as silver bands denote interstages on the rest of the rocket, it's likely color coding. It'd also be pretty easy to ensure the project is secret until it goes live, as Rocket Lab is a pretty small company. 

Granted, it's likely that I'm wearing a tin-foil hat and pulled this all out of thin air. But then again, it would make a lot of sense. If they don't tell the public about booster reusability, they could just avoid the negative press and scrutiny during the development phase by not covering recovery operations. With [Lockheed](https://i.imgur.com/W91o30B.jpg) as an investor, they could very well have made their investment contingent upon Rocket Lab basically blazing the way for ULA (a joint venture of Lockheed/Boeing) to prove SMART with what basically amounts to a smaller proof of concept. Also, you could probably knock that development out with only a couple engineers. It would only take a few launches, presumably, to develop, and they could reuse 90% of all their rocket engines (the 10% being the basically-irrecoverable Vacuum Rutherfords).

So, what do you think, /r/RocketLab? Am I onto something, or *on* something?

Edit: Immediately after posting, I found [this photo](https://i.imgur.com/R2uQWUR.jpg) online. It looks like that is, indeed, an interstage, and those 4 points could very well be for engine cluster ejection. However, it looks pretty cramped, so the extra space for re-entry gear would need to be in the engine section. Based on my super-cheezy MS Paint skills and available images, [it looks like that stuff could fit](https://i.imgur.com/M2g3r5o.jpg). As far as the public is concerned, the [thrust plate](https://i.imgur.com/idlMQZb.png) on top of the Rutherford is the furthest up piece of the engine, except for plumbing. I bet a couple good engineers could work around that plumbing. Also, that being a separation point means that even if SMART hardware isn't currently on the Electron, it would be much easier to integrate it than if the outer body was a contiguous tube.

Edit2: It looks like [that](https://i.imgur.com/hxlsy6M.jpg), in fact, *is* the [the same separation bracket](https://i.imgur.com/E1JA6CI.jpg) used on the [upper stage](https://i.imgur.com/zOn18BX.jpg). Here's a [look at the back side](https://i.imgur.com/pgQ9Hps.jpg) of it. I really think I might be onto something, here.

Edit3: This theory could also align with their well-known [ITAR issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/5u4b88/rocket_lab_wants_to_stop_you_taking_photos_if_a/). If they have their recovery vehicle in the middle of the marine exclusion zone, they could basically be guaranteed that nobody could get their hands on their engines. All marine vessels in the area would be known during that time, and the odds of being struck by your own tiny rocket if it malfunctions are laughably small. Who knows, maybe the FAA/ITAR people *forced* them to recover their engines, to make sure they don't fall into the wrong hands.

Edit4: Here's an old article in which Beck says Rocket Lab is *not* pursuing [reusability](http://www.satellitetoday.com/launch/2014/10/23/electron-to-launch-at-least-once-per-week-says-rocket-lab-ceo/). While that's definitely a strong argument against my case here, I'd say that a lot can change in 4 years, and the Electron is now likely quite different than what it was in 2014. Interestingly, Lockheed seems to have invested in [2015](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lockheed-rocketlab/lockheed-invests-in-rocket-labs-u-s-unit-to-keep-pace-with-innovation-idUSKBN0LY21Y20150302), specifically because they ""saw potential applications for Rocket Lab‚Äôs technologies light lift, hypersonic flight technologies and low-cost flight testing."" and that ""Lockheed‚Äôs investment in the New Zealand startup was aimed at helping Lockheed keep pace with innovation across the industry."" AKA direct measures to compete with SpaceX, so maybe SMART. Not coincidentally, [2015](http://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Supporting_Technologies/LV_Recovery_and_Reuse_AIAASpace_2015.pdf) is the year that ULA announced SMART, so obviously it was on their mind at the time. If they gave Rocket Lab a couple million bucks to do SMART, ULA would save a TON in development costs, and I bet Rocket Lab would spring for it. I'd say this all aligns with my theory.

RocketLab_posts.csv,RocketLab Capsule,"Rocket Lab, during the investor day, presented some illustrations for a human capsule for Neutron. While presenting, the company was very clear that this was not a capsule announcement but they are looking into the topic.

However, what is interesting is the size of the capsule presented with a human for scale. (Another member made a post on how much bigger the capsule is relative to Dragon from SpaceX).

To investigate whether the illustration was a mistake, I did some digging using the 2nd illustration of the capsule with a docking station. I utilized the docking station as a measurement foundation and compared the illustration with a relatively similar picture of a Dragon with a docking station. Here is what I found (rough measurements).

1. RocketLab's capsule is rougly 2.6 times the diameter of the docking station.
2. Dragon is rought 1.8 times the diameter of the docking station.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

1. It seems like that RKLB did not make a mistake when they showed a human for scale. RKLB may indeed be planning a much bigger capsule than Dragon and Starliner. (RKLB rarely makes mistakes on slides and it would be unlikely they made the size mistake on two slides)

Counter-argument; Dragon and Starliner are rougly 12 tonnes. Neutron in expendable mode can deliver 13 tonnes to LEO. Therefore it would be unlikely that they are planning a larger capsule.

Counter-counter argument:

1. RKLB is known for innovation and it is likely that they with the technology of 2025-2026 could develop a much lighter capsule
2. Neutron's performance metrics are based on the rocket performing in a chill mode. More performance could be achieved by pushing the engines to near their limit. i.e. Neutron if need be could potentially deliver +20 tonnes to LEO.

Let me know what you think?

&#x200B;

Update:

ISS docking station actual diameter: 2.4 meters

Estimated dragon diameter: 4.3 (actual 4) meters

Estimated RKLB capsule diameter: 6.2 meters

I.e. my calculations are rough estimates but not far off.",48,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xnqpmj/rocketlab_capsule/,0.3097,0.045,0.917,0.038
RocketLab_posts.csv,Rocket Lab's technological firsts - a comprehensive list,"Hey everyone,

it repeatedly happens to me that I talk to someone about how innovative Rocket Lab is and then the other one tells me about some first I didn't know about. Could someone please make a comprehensive list of all technological firsts Rocket Lab has achieved as of today (Sep 14, 2021)?

By technological I mean anything concerning design, production, hardware, software, and also possibly operations. I would not include pure business achievements like funds raised or anything related to the stock market (just in case they have any firsts in that category, which I don't know).

By first I mean either that Rocket Lab was the first entity to ever do something, or that they were the first ones to do something commercially, i.e. at scale and prospectively profitably.

By achieved I mean that they have actually done it, at least exemplary, and are not just planning to do it in the future.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Neutron crew capabilities,"Another poster in another subreddit stated that Neutron could put the weight of Soyuz into LEO and it got me thinking.  I hadn't considered that Rockelab could possibly straight up buy brand new Soyuz capsules from Energia to bootstrap Rocketlab's own human spaceflight program.

Russian engine manufacturer NPO Energomash has been selling Russian engines around the world for decades. China's Shenzhou human spacecraft is largely based off Soyuz. So its apparent that Russia has no problems selling their spaceflight hardware and designs to other nations. Additionally, engine sales and Soyuz seat sales are on the decline so Russia's spaceflight sector maybe more willing to do something like selling whole Soyuz to make up the budget shortfalls.

Soyuz capsule has a long heritage of successful work and it would allow Rocketlab to leapfrog into a whole new business of space tourism and possibly even go after future NASA Commercial Crew contracts.  Further cutting development time, there are hundreds of trained Soyuz pilots and commanders that are veterans of spaceflight in a number of government space programs around the world.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Neutron: so what's in the middle? :),"Was just re-watching Everyday Astronaut's interview with Peter Beck ([https://youtu.be/aXoXDp3j850](https://youtu.be/aXoXDp3j850)) and the main points that I could get were: fully reusable 1st stage; propulsive landing; different material selection from electron; potentially ""coming in hot"" without any propulsive slowdown (like Electron tests - 6:20+); rp1 + lox on both stages; didn't want to say cycle type but could be eletric-pump-fed (9:40+) although Beck's a fan of expander cycle too; 

then there's:

12:10 - EA: ""we couldn't help but notice there's 4 engines on the render and you're doing propulsive landing which would be rather difficult"" 

12:45 - PB: ""yeah well there could be something in between those 4 engines that you couldn't see as well.. potentionally"" and Peter wants the least amount of engines as possible (kind of confirming the 4)

&#x200B;

soo.... what's in the middle? :) here's my totally crazy uneducated guesses (my only qualifications being KSP and youtube):

* gas turbine electric generator (maybe even pressure-fed, monopropellant, for restart simplicity): makes enough power for electric-pump-fed cycle on 4 big engines, so no need for batteries, and on landing there's a bypass and it provides enough thrust to land?
* same as above, except even crazier - a drogue chute / parachute to slow down and then plop 6 little drone props open up and land it down (powered by the gas-generator)?
* just a single smaller engine?

RocketLab_posts.csv,How important is the upcoming Rocket Lab moon mission is? Am I missing anything?,"https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/lunar/

Scheduled in March of next year, Rocket Lab will launch a electron rocket with a Photon Lunar spacecraft that will carry a CAPSTONE to cis-lunar orbit to the moon.  


Why is this important?  

The goal is to insert a small sat into a near rectilinear lunar halo orbit - something that has never before been attempted before. 

It is important this succeeds for the future or the NASA moon artemis program as it will provide non-stop communication to the Gateway as there will be no blackouts like prior moon missions and it provides access to the entire lunar surface.

The CAPSTONE small sat will be delivered to the moon by a Rocket Lab photon spacecraft.  This photon spacecraft is what makes capstone possible and appears very unique and will help pay the way for the Venus mission.  Also if successful will lead to future customers signing up for Rocket Lab‚Äôs photon spacecraft.

CAPSTONE will be delivered to lunar orbit by the Photon spacecraft, NOT a kickstage or upper stage, but a spacecraft (Photon).  This will be huge to showing the world what the photon can do and will likely lead to more and more missions down the road.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Is Rocket Lab moving away from Matlab and towards Python in all jobs?,"Hi guys,

&#x200B;

I am thinking of going to uni this year and doing some ad-hoc courses in Python and data analysis to better prepare myself for some mechanical engineering roles in Rocket Lab. On many job listings, Python seems to be the sole requirement as far as data analysis goes.

&#x200B;

Does this indicate that Rocket Lab no longer is favouring Matlab and that I don't have to worry about taking Matlab courses to prepare myself better for some roles, such as in propulsion or thermofluids? Getting into one of these would be a dream!

Thanks in advance for all answers!

RocketLab_posts.csv,Advantages of being able to launch from anywhere?,"I have spent time over the past couple months studying rocketlab and their competitors.

One thing I noticed is that Astra (especially) and also Firefly CEOs kept talking about the need to be able to launch from anywhere.

Can someone explain to me what is the point of say doing mobile launches like Astra is planning to do?

Assuming rocketlab is able to launch in New Zealand in theory every 3 days, what would be the point from them to use a similar approach as Astra?

I feel having your private launch pad with a lot of available windows is the winning solution, but I suspect I could be missing something.

I would also believe that the management of a startup launching a satellite would mostly care about the orbit, not really where the satellite is launched from.

Are their any limitations out of launching from New Zealand? I‚Äôm thinking maybe many orbits aren‚Äôt available‚Ä¶?

Side note I realize there are covid restrictions out of New Zealand, but I would keep that out of the discussion.

I've been working on this project for several months now and im super excited to share it with you finally.

Rocket Lab Companion is the one-stop place to get everything Rocket Lab. Being a fan myself (obviously) I always want to know when things are happening; so I made this. The app includes things such as Electron statistics, launchpad information and previous/upcoming lanches. 

I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed developed it!

Over the coming weeks and months, I'm going to be adding to it further. Some features currently in the pipeline include:

* Launch Push Notification
* The ability to add launches to your calendar of choice. 
* A news section so you can keep up to date on the latest developments.

I'm always open to feedback and feature requests so shoot me a PM or contact me through the app if you have any ideas.

The app is completely free and always will be. It's currently only available on the Google Play Store, however, I'm looking into making it available on iOS in the coming months. Let me know if you want this! 

**Google Play Link**: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mozaa.rl\_companion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mozaa.rl_companion&hl=en)

###Launch window:

The 10-day launch window opens on Friday, December 8, 2017, NZST. During this time a four-hour launch window will open daily from 2:30 p.m. NZDT (0130 UTC).

The test launch attempt will only proceed if conditions are ideal for launch. Due to the nature of launching rockets, planned lift-offs are often subject to multiple and subsequent postponements, or scrubs, to allow for small, technical modifications and to wait for ideal weather conditions.

## What is going to be on board for this flight?

Last two operational (TROPICS-06 & TROPICS-07) satellites for NASA's Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation Structure and Storm Intensity with a Constellation of SmallSats (TROPICS) mission.

The CubeSats are designed to provide rapid-refresh microwave measurements that can be used to determine temperature, pressure, and humidity inside hurricanes as they form and evolve.

RocketLab_posts.csv,Why use and Oxygen Rich Closed Cycle on Archimedes and not a Fuel Rich Closed Cycle?,Anyone understand why RocketLab hasn't used a fuel rich staged combustion cycle for their new Archimedes engine but is going with Oxygen rich?  From my very limited understanding (Everyday Astronaut school of Rocket Engine Cycles) is seems like once the fuel is CH and not RP1 the coking problems for a fuel rich pre burner disappear.  This problem must have been solved by SpaceX for their CH fuel rich pre burner on the Raptor.  But it seems that one of the big challenges for Raptor was SpaceX developing a new alloy for their O2 rich pre burner for Raptor.  Is RocketLab working on new alloys for this or has rocket engine metallurgy moved on since the start of Raptor development?,36,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/xvqw1q/why_use_and_oxygen_rich_closed_cycle_on/,0.9681,0.205,0.716,0.078

I am just an interested engineer with no knowledge of rocket science, but the description is very clear and understandable.
With such information it is possible to learn something new (Paschen's Law). It's a great hobby to watch RocketLab at work :-)

RocketLab can be very happy with the result and look forward to the next Electron missions with great confidence.

## What is going to be on board for this flight?

The primary payload aboard this mission includes nine of the latest generation SuperDove satellites from Planet, the operator of the world‚Äôs largest
constellation of Earth-imaging satellites. Each of the nine SuperDoves in Flock 4e‚Äô will be integrated with and deployed from Rocket Lab‚Äôs Maxwell
dispensers, the industry‚Äôs lightest CubeSat dispenser in its class. Planet‚Äôs constellation provides medium-resolution global coverage that enables
researchers, students, businesses and governments to discover patterns, detect early signals of change, and make timely, informed decisions

Canon Electronics Inc.‚Äôs CE-SAT-IIB, was procured by satellite rideshare and mission management provider Spaceflight Inc. The mission objective
for the CE-SAT-IIB satellite is a technical demonstration microsatellite developed with a middle-size telescope equipped with an ultra-high
sensitivity camera to take night images of the Earth and small size telescopes which are suitable for CubeSat use.

Some personal takeaways:

\-Beck seems like he doesn¬¥t like Kemp or Astra

\-Chris Kemp seems to be a very unsympathetic guy

\-Beck is the CEO/CFO likely feeling the most comfortable about his company and his decisions and thoughts being the most thought through

\-Shahzad being the CFO of Relativity Space probably wasn¬¥t their best guy for this discussion (Tim Ellis (CEO) would probably have been the better choice)

\-Financial guys are very Astra and Relativity Space focused while forgetting about the big winner in the room",63,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/pa9z5n/interesting_discussion_rocketlabastrarelativity/,0.9698,0.159,0.777,0.065

investing_posts.csv,What is your thought on my portfolio and strategy?,"I'm 30M. I recently started investing in ETF & individual stocks. Below is my portfolio I figured it out myself, but I am not sure if it is reasonable in the long run, and I want to hear other people's opinions, comments, and criticism on it. I put in a lump sum (a large amount of my saving money after I excluded emergency money) and plan to DCA monthly.

**ETF 75%**  
\- iShares Core MSCI World (Acc) - IWDA

**Individual stocks 25%**  
\- **Tech Growth 12%:** Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Palantir, Nvidia, Tesla  
\- **(High-)dividend 5%:** Siemens, Merck & Co, Swiss Re, Exxon Mobil, McDonald  
\- **Consumer defensive 3%:** UnitedHealth, Mastercard, Cola  
\- **Personal favorite 3.5%:** Garmin, Air Product and Chemicals, Walmart, Rolls-Royce, Airbus  
\- **Aerospace & Defensive 1.5%**: Rocket Lab, Howmet, RTX Corp

The reason that my portfolio contains more than 20 stocks is that I want to diversify it in terms of the stocks, not types of assets. 

My concerns/questions are:

1. I'm not sure if I hold too many stocks in the same category (e.g. tech stocks) and most of them are already covered by the IWDA ETF.
2. I'm also considering holding only 1 or 2 high-dividend stocks like AbbVie, instead of 5 dividend stocks. Is it a good idea?
3. My long-term plan follows ""time in the market > timing the market"". So I plan to split DCA in half and put in ETF and stocks equally. I also read about the [Enhanced DCA](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b40399/enhanced_dollar_cost_averaging/). Statistically, is the Enhanced DCA worth a try?

Anyway, I went home that night, watched a few videos on some cool stuff in quantum computing and said screw it, I‚Äôm long on quantum computing. It seriously will change our world dramatically when we inevitably figure it out. So I thought it was a deal and dumped a few grand into it. 

Since then, there‚Äôs been some pretty exciting stuff happen in the quantum computing world. Researchers have figured out how to control qubits and Amazon decided to invest $4B into their own quantum computer. D-Wave Quantum cracked a standardized binary encryption a few days ago too.

Anyway, they‚Äôre all up almost 100% since then and I decided I‚Äôm gonna stick around for the ride and go long on quantum. Quantum will expand our computing capabilities exponentially. And it‚Äôs probably sooner than we think.

SpaceXMasterrace_posts.csv,Appreciation for the Rest of the Industry,"EDIT: I meant to post this is r/spacexlounge, not here. I‚Äôm leaving the post up because deleting posts is for cowards.




We all love SpaceX, they've done incredible things for the space industry and have set the pace for the next generation of spaceflight. No company has been able to excite people about spaceflight, or broken from convention, nearly as much as SpaceX has in the last 5-10 years. As a result of this, communities like this one are some of the most enthusiastic, vibrant groups of space enthusiasts out there. As such, I've been a little disappointed with the sheer amount of negativity I've seen from SpaceX fans about other launch providers. I believe that being cynical about any part of rocketry is cheating yourself. I wanted to take a bit of time to gush about them and give them their due credit. 

I worry that in this quasi-tribalist situation we find ourselves in, we lose sight of how fucking impressive rocketry is. Every single vehicle that is capable of spaceflight is an engineering masterpiece, each with unique design considerations that result in hundreds, if not thousands, of brilliant innovation. There is nothing routine about spaceflight. I‚Äôm gonna go company by company and highlight aspects of each that I find impressive and defend what I consider undeserved attacks against them.

**United Launch Alliance**

The venerable ULA has become somewhat of a poster child for the mainstream, old, space industry. Amongst other things, their heavy use of heritage hardware has made them fairly unexciting. 

However, they are an incredibly impressive company. They are the *only* launch provider in the world who can boast a 100% success rate. While lengthy, their assembly and integration system is a marvel to behold. As for heritage equipment, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that a lot of tech in the space industry does not rapidly change, and the old equipment that is kept in use is often kept due to being incredibly reliable.

As for rocket technology, the RL-10 engine makes the Centaur upper stage and Delta IV heavy upper stages are *still* the best god damned upper-stages in history-they blow the Falcon Upper stage out of the water. They‚Äôre such high-performance engines, in fact, that despite the Falcon 9‚Äôs and Falcon Heavy‚Äôs far superior first stages, the Atlas V and Delta IV Heavy *still* reign supreme in the high energy orbit market.

There is a reason ULA is still hired for so many launches, despite SpaceX‚Äôs apparent superiority in all respects. At this point, I want to mention something I think is often lost in these discussions. Stat sheets we find online rarely reflect the real world. On paper, the Falcon Heavy blows the Delta IV Heavy out of the water in every conceivable way. But what is missed is Falcon is designed to be a ‚ÄúLEO Chucker‚Äù with its high energy, aggressive gravity turn in atmo, Delta IV was made to put heavy payloads in high orbits like GEO. And since it‚Äôs central purpose is launching heavy recon satellites for the DoD, money is really not a concern. In fact, I count the high price tag as a win, as that is anywhere from $250 to $500 million per launch of military money going to support spaceflight. In addition, ULA‚Äôs performance/cost gap between Atlas and Delta will be largely filled by Vulcan-Centaur.

Space programs are insanely expensive, and at the end of the day the $30 million give or take savings of using SpaceX rockets is often not as dominating a concern as we make it out to be. There are a thousand factors that go into selecting a launch service. 

And one has to remember the one and only Space Cowboy Tory Bruno, the definition of a Steely-eyed Missile Man.

**Blue Origin**

Jeff Who? While Elon‚Äôs joke was topical at the time, with Blue Origin‚Äôs near absence of a presence in popular space media, Blue is on track to become SpaceX‚Äôs #1 competitor. Here‚Äôs why:

They‚Äôve been around since 2000-- a full 2 years *before* SpaceX, and are funded completely out of pocket by the richest man alive. So where have they been? They‚Äôve been working. The company‚Äôs motto is ‚Äúgradatim ferociter‚Äù or: ‚Äústep by step, ferociously.‚Äù Which is my personal favorite ever motto. 

For most of its history the company has been very small, but with very big dreams. Their first project, New Shepard, a fully reusable vehicle intended for space tourism, successfully performed an autonomous landing after a sub-orbital spaceflight in November 2015, narrowly beating SpaceX as the first of its kind. Now they‚Äôve got a bigger project: New Glenn.

New Glenn is a monster - a LEO chucker rivaling Falcon Heavy with a gargantuan reusable first stage that will propulsively land on a moving ship. In addition, it‚Äôs 7-meter fairing allows for the largest ever cargo volume. It‚Äôs been in development for a while and is still more than a year away from its maiden launch. But it is very, very real. Keep in mind the company‚Äôs motto. Blue is not afraid to take their time and will launch when they‚Äôre ready. In the meantime, they have been building a massive system of infrastructure, an assembly-line rocket factory has already been erected and their launch facility is nearing completion. They aim for at least one launch a month and are dead set on being capable of that before kicking off production.

The last few years have been huge for Blue, Bezos had spent a total of $500 million on the company from 2000 to 2015. Today, they‚Äôre spending billions every year, with Bezos continually increasing funding. In the past 3 years, they‚Äôve gone from around 600 employees to 3,000. Before dismissing Blue for their apparent lack of action, keep in mind who‚Äôs funding it. Bezos couldn't care less about spectacle or optics, as opposed to Elon's wide public appeal. A chief reason for this is that SpaceX is funded primarily by investors, while Blue is all out of Jeff‚Äôs pocket. This is the man who built Amazon from the ground up for decades, keeping it in the red as he slowly built up the infrastructure before suddenly dominating the market. 

**Boeing**

Boeing has some serious management issues that have greatly hindered the company, but this should not be taken out on their projects. They employ - and take great care of, mind you - some of the best engineers on the planet.

**Starliner**

Starliner was built from scratch to be the first-ever reusable crewed spacecraft (Shuttle was refurbishable). While Crew Dragon is intended for crewed use only once, Starliner is designed for up to 10 reuses. It‚Äôs nowhere near as exciting looking as Dragon, but do not discount the technical marvel that it is. As for cost per seat, its as expensive as the Soyuz was, but NASA doesn't make profits - they receive the money they need to keep the ISS crewed regardless. The primary goal of ComCrew was for the money spent to be spent in the American Aerospace ecosystem.

**SLS**

SLS is a jobs program, that much is known. But so is most of the space industry in some way or another. The government pumps billions into aerospace to maintain the industrial base so that the US always has a large pool of talented, experienced aerospace experts, and large scale manufacturing capability. The equipment for making rocket parts is often more expensive than all the parts they produce in their lifetime. This is the chief explanation for the massive RS-25 contract awarded to Aerojet-Rocketdyne earlier this year. Don‚Äôt think of all these billions as being wasted, think of them as dollars that would have otherwise gone to making weapons being used to support our aerospace industry. Money to Boeing for example trickles down to their hundreds of subcontractors. Aerojet‚Äôs R&D will surely benefit greatly from this contract.

(despite its crazy price tag, the RS-25 is probably STILL the best rocket engine ever made)

Why is SLS so expensive? It‚Äôs not as straightforward as may think. First, Boeing takes as much government money as they can, though we all knew that. Second, Congress does NOT KNOW HOW BUDGETS WORK. NASA has a yearly budget request, and each program requests the amount of money they need for that year. You almost always need more money in the specific years of a project than you do later- hiring, buying materials, building infrastructure, etc., but Congress likes flat budgets.

This means NASA and Boeing can't afford to design, build, and test the entire Orion and SLS all at once. It‚Äôs had to be phased out and staggered over 15+ years. By a huge margin, the #1 cost is always paying people. The cost of building rockets is cheap compared to this. Thus, the more you build, the cheaper each one is. Every additional year means another year‚Äôs salary to the thousands of incredibly talented people working on SLS. THIS is why SLS is supposedly over a billion dollars per launch. It does NOT cost anywhere near that much to build, but the salaries of so many people for so long has created a massive development cost. But keep in mind: NASA is not a company, and does not care about profit. This is a problem that has plagued NASA since its inception and is the main reason the Commercial Crew Program exists.

The beauty of NASA is that they can front the bill for developing this kind of stuff, that can then be used by the public.

And if you‚Äôll forgive me for praising SLS/Orion, Orion is a masterpiece, it's the most capable and advanced spacecraft ever. And building a rocket with capabilities like SLS is no small feat. Total costs of SLS/Orion are upwards of $30 billion at this point, and many have scoffed at the ‚Äúcost-saving‚Äù of using old shuttle parts. However, Project Apollo, in today‚Äôs money, cost $283 billion in today‚Äôs money, as they built the program from scratch. We stand on the shoulders of giants, and every day we come closer to establishing a deep space presence. This can not and will not be done by SpaceX alone.

**NASA**

SpaceX owes a great debt to NASA, and not just for the billions in contracts they‚Äôve received from the agency. They wouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near where they are today. We all have great dreams for Starship, but there is no way it will ever become human-rated, or live up to its promise, without their help and support. NASA‚Äôs goals are pure, and for every egregious political obstacle we bemoan, remember that they‚Äôre the ones who have to navigate them.

**The Industry of the Next Generation**

And of course, there has been an explosion of smaller space companies. Richard Branson‚Äôs Virgin Galactic and Virgin Orbit are making strides in space tourism and small payload services. Rocket Lab‚Äôs Electron Rocket is providing the cheapest ever launch services for small payloads. Every year they‚Äôre being joined by newcomers like Firefly and Masten. 

I didn‚Äôt mean to go after anyone, and i‚Äôm sorry if I got carried away. Spaceflight is my #1 passion, and it has always irked me to see people callously dismissing some of the greatest engineering accomplishments of our time because they don‚Äôt land themselves, or don‚Äôt benefit from a bombastic public figure like Elon. This is the most exciting time for spaceflight since 1969, and we have the privilege to see the birth of a new era. Taking the next great leap, becoming a species of space travelers, will for a certainty take far longer than we expect. But when we do finally take it, it will be a combined effort by everyone I‚Äôve mentioned and more.

stocks_posts.csv,What do we think about IOVA?,"Firstly congrats everyone on RKLB, ACHR and LUNR gains. It was fun ride, I have to be honest I had jumped off the wagon a bit earlier but hat off to all of you that mooned! 

Also for some of you that jumped on ZETA, enjoy the good days that await. 

But let‚Äôs talk about IOVA‚Ä¶:

Another biopharma stock trying to solve the issues of cancer. An industry that is a Holy Grail for all pump and dumpers out here. 

But is this one different? To be honest I do not know, but that is why I am posting this. To hear other sides, other points of view. 

IOVA is currently sitting around $9. These are levels of before the this year run to $16 (what goes up must come down, when pumped and dumped). However‚Ä¶ this company reported revenues, 90.86mil revenue to be precise. Granted, not enough to support current market cap but bear in mind it is bio industry we talk about. It takes 1 approval and it is too late.

Leadership:
CEO is there since 2016, seems like an experienced guy. Was contributor to many oncology drugs already developed and approved.

Others seem legit as well, this post is already too long‚Ä¶ feel free to research yourself.

They also own a bit less than 12% so there is certain commitment there.  And of course the vanguard, black rock etc. are heavily involved as well. More than 87% is owned by institutions. 

Amtagvi product got approved by FDA and that is now generating certain revenue. They plan tk get approval in Canada, Europe and UK as well. 

They also work on LN-145, IOV-4001 and IOV-3001 but let‚Äôs be honest these are long shots and nothing guarantee success of these.

I know these are speculations and putting some numbers from the future is no way to go but I feel like I have to just to make this post a bit more complete.

Potential yearly revenue if approved broader and if nothing goes wrong  is 12billion (amount of people with cancer of specific type * cost of treatment) but realistic values at beginning is 1-2bill per year or even less. 

And then for all the gamblers time that with moon if other drugs get approved as well. 

Company with 90mil revenue and 80 million of debt with 2,8 billion market cap and 440 million of operating expenses. Company with future (on the moon or in the sand). Do you hate IOVA or you will become a bag holder?

I‚Äôll give an example that pertains to me. I‚Äôm currently invested in Sofi, PLTR, and RKLB, so this has been an incredible year for me. But looking back, it‚Äôs starting to really feel like total and utter exuberance again like 2021. YouTube videos and subreddits have been saying over and over how this is only the beginning and we‚Äôre going to be at 500 next year.

However, post earnings the stock was mostly flat. Why? Their reported backlog was unchanged from previous quarter report (backlog is 4.6B btw).

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: ‚ÄúIn the third quarter 2024 we once again executed against our end-to-end space strategy with successes and key achievements reached across small and medium launch, as well as space systems. Revenue grew 55% year-on-year to $105 million and we continue to see strong demand growth with our backlog at $1.05 billion. Significant achievements for the quarter included signing a launch service agreement for multiple launches on Neutron with a confidential commercial satellite constellation customer; successfully launching twelve Electron launches year-to-date, making 2024 a record year for launches with more still to come; signing $55 million in new Electron launches, further cementing Electron‚Äôs position as a global launch leader; and being selected by NASA to complete a study contract for a proposal to retrieve samples from Mars and return them to Earth as part of a world-first mission. We expect to close out the year strongly with more Electron launches scheduled in November and December, alongside continued progress across Neutron and space systems, that is behind our guidance for a record $125-$135 million revenue quarter in Q4.‚Äù

**Business Highlights for the Third Quarter 2024, plus updates since September 30, 2024.**

**Electron:**

* Achieved a new annual launch record of 12 Electron launches to date, with more scheduled across November and December 2024. Electron is the world‚Äôs third most-frequently launched rocket annually by vehicle type and remains the United States‚Äô second most-frequently launched rocket annually.
* Signed several new Electron launch contracts in Q3 2024 with a total value of $55m, demonstrating an increased average selling price of $8.4m and showcasing a 67% pricing increase since the rocket‚Äôs debut launch.
* Successful Electron launches for three separate commercial satellite constellation operators in Q3, including two missions launched within just eight days. In addition to these, Electron‚Äôs most recent mission, launched in the fourth quarter on November 5¬†^(th)¬†, 2024, included an expedited turnaround of just 10 weeks between contract signing and launch.

**Neutron:**

* Signed a launch service agreement for multiple launches on Neutron with a confidential commercial satellite constellation operator that signifies the beginning of a productive collaboration that could see Neutron deploy the entire constellation.
* Announced a federal defense contract that supports Neutron and the development of its Archimedes engine with the U.S. Air Force‚Äôs Research Laboratory.
* Doubled engine testing cadence for Archimedes over the quarter at Rocket Lab‚Äôs engine test site in Mississippi, alongside strong production execution at the Company‚Äôs Engine Development Complex in California which included multiple engines manufactured, assembled, and shipped for engine testing.
* Significant progress made across Neutron‚Äôs structures and infrastructure, including the completion of construction on the rocket‚Äôs Assembly, Integration, and Test (A.I.T.) facility in Virginia.
* Well-positioned to on-ramp to the U.S. Space Force‚Äôs National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Lane 1 program, which began accepting proposals in November 2024 to on-ramp new launch providers to an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract valued at $5.6 billion over a five-year period.

**Space Systems:**

* Completed production and delivery of two spacecraft on time and on budget for NASA‚Äôs ESCAPADE mission to Mars.
* Selected by NASA to complete a study contract for a proposal to retrieve samples from Mars and return them to Earth, a first-of-its-kind mission.
* Completed two new spacecraft for Varda Space Industries to conduct the 2¬†^(nd)¬†and 3¬†^(rd)¬†missions to return in-space manufacturing capsules to Earth.

Also, if I really believe in this stock and that the calls will pay, should I be buying the ""dip""?

WallStreetBets_posts.csv,Concerns about RKLB and similar space stocks,"We all know RKLB has had a monstrous year and for good reason, their fundamentals are solid and have lots of room to grow.

My concern is with the amount of satellites up right now (around 11,000 as of June). Most of them are actively functioning and in low earth orbit.

Over time, as they get deactivated they'll just sit there waiting to collide with each other creating lots of space junk hindering future satellite deployment. There's no way to get them down and no way to clean up the junk when they do crash.

At the rate they're launching now (2.6k /year),  how long until it's no longer possible/feasible to launch any more? Will it even be in our lifetime?


Wanna go long on RKLB but this possibility makes me really hesitant.

WallStreetBets_posts.csv,$PL - Earth Data to Become Increasingly Valuable Under Trump Administration,"Alright, cat has gotten out of the bag while I have been writing this and Planet Labs is no longer a secret. This analysis is not written by ChatGPT, hopefully not nauseatingly sales-y, and has no regarded emojis or over the top use of ‚ÄúTo the Moon‚Äù. No frills, just my take on where I think there is deep value.

**Overview:**  
Earth observation data as a business has long struggled to be profitable. It requires significant CAPEX, is high risk (strapping a cam to a rocket essentially), and the R+D on a lot of the imaging can be pretty exorbitant. The main leader in the space, Planet Labs, went public in the SPAC boom. As a whole, they‚Äôve underperformed the promises they presented in their first prospectus. Planet Labs sought to be a ""One to Many"" data provider, and their main selling point was that earth data could be widely commercialized. While this is still fundamentally true, in the time since going public they have essentially become a government contractor (75% revenue from some form of government with only a quarter from general business use) (source: Q2 Investor Presentation). Revenue being sourced primarily from the government is two sides of the same coin and the value lies in the eye of the beholder: it's bad because they are too reliant on too few customers, or that government revenue is extremely sticky and a major growth driver under the right administration. I am of the latter opinion.

I think we are at an inflection point that could cause Planet Labs to become far more profitable than they are currently, which will cause their valuation to adjust higher (far higher than even their recent run-up). While the use cases for the their data is very broad, it has become evident in the last few years that the most profitable one is government use.

**My thesis lies in the following:**

1. Donny and a Republican majority House/Senate will have a much larger Defense and Intelligence budget. They will be willing to pay a premium to obtain top tier defense and intelligence data from vendors like $PL.
2. NATO contract is highly promising (https://spacenews.com/planet-signs-deal-with-nato-to-supply-satellite-imagery/) and is a first of its kind deal. Follow-on mandates to come if $PL executes.
3. Launch of Tanager-1 (a first of its kind methane specific tracking satellite - highly valuable for int'l governments seeking to gather data on parties with the most harmful emissions) and subsequent release of data should bolster top-line (new sales team will hopefully execute).

Also before you ask, why can‚Äôt RKLB, SpaceX, etc. just strap cameras to their rockets? Or why can‚Äôt Starlink tack some cameras on their satellites? Boiled down most simply: they can‚Äôt do it efficiently or cost-effectively. They‚Äôd have to divert time and resources away from their primary businesses (which already have their own significant challenges) just to fight an uphill battle; this can be discussed more at length if clarity is needed but I just don‚Äôt see it as a likely scenario. Generally speaking this would more likely materialize as a continued symbiotic relationship (Planet Labs uses SpaceX rockets to launch their satellite constellations for example).

**Other thoughts:**  
Larger market cap compared to closest peer, no debt, invests more heavily in development of new technologies (I view this as a plus long term - they understand that earth images can be commoditized and are spending heavily to develop a suite of analytics products which can materially enhance user experience - this will create competitive advantage long-term; and yes before you ask, their data is being used to train AI models - see Laconic deal today - perfect example of their R+D spend beginning to pay off), recently trimmed workforce (leaner operating structure), largest and highest-quality satellite fleet (and it's not even close - actually a staggering difference), multiple partnerships with Google (Google owns \~12%), rumors are circling that they will finally announce positive adj EBITDA either this quarter or next (management has been targeting Q4)

**Position and Price Target**:  
I am planning to update this and positions continuously; I do believe in the growth of PL and will likely add on. May roll the 12/20‚Äôs, not decided yet.

Position:  
12/20/2025 $5C 9x  
4/17/2025 $5C 4x

Target: $PL 5/1/2025: $10/share

**TLDR:**  
Earth data used for defense and intelligence will become significantly more valuable over the next year due to major administrative tailwinds. Donny's Department of Defense will award more government contracts at a higher value, which will finally let them scale in the way they were meant to (R+D, Capex, and cash burn from last few years will all be justified by a stronger top-line). The mature business model for $PL is essentially a software company with high gross margins. The margin expansion will finally be realized as more contracts are awarded and valuations will correct accordingly. Additionally, while they do seek to serve a wide array of industries (i.e. agriculture, natural resources, etc.) the biggest short term tailwinds (I think) will be defense and intelligence contracts.

WallStreetBets_posts.csv,Bigbear.ai is primed and ready for take-off,"# TL;DR:

BigBear.ai is flying under the radar but has massive potential. This is your chance to grab a future AI juggernaut while it's still cheap. There is a perfect storm of catalysts brewing (government contracts, strategic market positioning, and booming AI demand) - think Palantir but still in its early innings.

**What is it?**

Bigbear is an AI-powered decision-making and analytics platform with a strong focus on government contracts, particularly with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and intelligence agencies. Their software helps organizations predict, visualize, and act on complex data to drive better outcomes.

**Why has it been overlooked?**

1. Tiny market cap of around $550m.
2. Low institutional ownership of less than 10% - mostly VC and Retail (although this has been growing over the last few months).
3. Went public via SPAC so the share price dropped massively initially.

**What it has going for it**

1. Secured a 5-year $165m USD contract from the US Army in October - clearly working closely with government agencies.
2. 2024 Q3 22.1% revenue increase to $41.5m and an improved gross margin of 25.9%, despite a net loss of $12.2m.
3. It's cheap af - expecting FY24 revenue of up to $180m at just $550m market cap. Granted it is loss-making currently but so is RKLB, ACHR, etc..
4. Rated as a Strong Buy from Wall Street analysts.
5. Has diverse revenue streams in healthcare and warehousing, increasing addressable market (already have contracts with Amazon).
6. $437m¬†backlog as of latest earning call.
7. Acquired Pangiam in 2023, a leader in facial recognition tech (CEO was former Director of Homeland Security).
8. The share price has been steadily rising over the past few months, but has yet to explode.

**Catalysts going forward**

Here we get a bit theoretical but I believe there is huge upside here for a few reasons:

1. Trump in office - more spending on defence and domestic security budgets (facial recognition is great for finding illegal immigrants hmmm).
2. It comes across as massively undervalued given it's current revenue and growth potential - trading at just over 3x forward revenue vs Palantir at 45x forward revenue.
3. Institutional ownership is rising fast - smart money is catching on for good reason.
4. Trend-wise, this stock fits the profile of something that will absolutely skyrocket on any positive news. AI deeptech, DoD contracts, growing revenue, and hugely overlooked.
5. It currently has 80 open positions on linkedin and with around 500 employees, this suggests they are investing hard for growth.

Basically, this is your chance to get in early on the next PLTR.

The earnings call was the main driving force for the share price rocketing up.¬† Shorts were caught napping and they desperately had to scramble to cover their positions which probably drove the share price up even more to the new ATH of >$27. As a result, short interest decreased dramatically (\~20%) from the previous month. Short interest was still high at \~49.28 million shares short or \~13% of the float as of 11/29/2024. I think new shorts have since then opened new short positions (this is how shorts typically react after a massive price spike) and they‚Äôre heavily shorting the stock which is partially causing the downtrend in the share price.¬† The other reason for the downtrend in the share price is probably due to profit taking.¬† My thinking is that we will see share price consolidation in the $20 - 22 range at least in the near term.

RKLB_posts.csv,Preferential treatment of SpaceX under Trump presidency,"Hi there,

I was analyzing my portfolio and was wondering what the effect of a trump presidency would mean for RKLB, since I would imagine SpaceX will absorb most of the government contracts due to Elon musk being in close ties with Trump. I'm thinking this will push RKLB to push for a more commercial approach and less relient on government contracts. 

What do you think? I will say that I believe since RKLB is a fair bit smaller than SpaceX at this point. I doubt anything will really happen in terms of competitivity from SpaceX, but I'm wondering how you see RKLB in this situation. It might as well be that this presidency opens up new opportunities in terms of Space exploration.

RKLB_posts.csv,Space Systems Potential,"Spinning off a comment, on a post that may get deleted, I thought an interesting discussion might be had on the potential of the Space Systems side of Rocket Lab.

From one of the recent articles on the CHIPs award of $23.9 million to expand manufacturing capacity of space grade solar panels. 

‚ÄúPolaris Market Research to estimate that the global satellite solar cell materials market size will grow to $111.46 billion by 2032 at a compound annual growth rate of 13.2%.‚Äú

**Edit: the Zack‚Äôs/Yahoo Finance article says billions, but I‚Äôve been informed the actual Polaris Market Research says $111.46 million. I found other sources that say $1.1 billion for space solar by 2030. Either way, nowhere near the above do I edited this post. However, I still believe space systems as a whole will be a multi-billion dollar revenue stream in the coming years, just with less of that from solar than theorized above.**

We are all excited for the Neutron launch and joining the medium lift market, the increased revenue, the increased margin with reusability. And the fact it opens up the Space as a Service market with a constellation launched by Neutron‚Ä¶ I definitely am.

However, I think Space Systems is too often ignored in the future potential for Rocket Lab. Space systems, the manufacturing side of the business with space grade solar panels, reaction wheels, separation systems, satellite manufacturing, spacecraft manufacturing, etc‚Ä¶ access to that market is going to be absolutely huge over the next several years imo, and is going to be a huge revenue driver for Rocket Lab. The bad inherited contracts from the Solaero acquisition are pretty much done with, the company just received a CHIPs award to expand manufacturing capacity, and alongside the other parts of space systems, I really see this side of the company driving it into multi-billions of revenue pre-constellation revenue. It has an absolutely massive potential imo and could really crank revenue through the roof as the market grows over the next couple years. The Constellation for space as a service will just be the cherry on top at that point.

Thoughts?

RKLB_posts.csv,Why I'm Holding till 2030 at least. My RKLB DD post.,"# Introduction

I‚Äôve been following Rocket Lab since 2019, before it SPAC-ed in 2021. Having already known the company, I aped in following the SPAC announcement in the range of $12-$15. Slowly averaged down the cost through the SPAC-pocalypse. Average price probably in the range of $8-$10 not $4.78 as I changed brokers.

[Current position \~168,000 shares. \(\~140,000 shares are mine, the rest are held for family\) Have only trimmed \~10&#37; of shares in the recent run up as part of risk management, portfolio was 100&#37; in RKLB.](https://preview.redd.it/vn1prfwdko3e1.jpg?width=1093&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af5f6ad220bd27de3e600e6edb768f1ac71a63ae)

With the increase in stock price over the last few months and the increase in newcomers asking price target questions and new posts every time it hits a new round number, people asking if they should take profit as they expect a pull back to happen, there hasn‚Äôt been a proper DD post in awhile and I feel that many are not capturing the point that Sir Peter Beck's end goal for Rocket Lab is to be an **END-TO-END Space Company.** In my opinion it will be impossible to attribute a price target for $RKLB just simply because the industry is still in its infancy stage, instead, what is important is to see just how much of the growing space industry Rocket Lab could possibly capture in the next 5-10 years.

This is my own DD post and is not financial advise, I will attempt to cover and break down Rocket Labs business segments and why I will hold be a shareholder till 2030 and beyond.

[Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, spacecraft, satellite components, and on-orbit management - 2024 Q3 Earnings Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/xjvg1d975p3e1.jpg?width=1257&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fd1ccef8c9bea2cbd8d74e37fac398b64680181)

Although in the name, Rocket Lab is not just a launch provider, but an end-to-end space company providing, not just the launch service but also complete spacecraft design, manufacturing, satellite components and on-orbit management. Eventually, the company intends to use the experience to deliver and provide their own service from space through its own **satellite constellation**.

# Business Segments

**1. Electron**

[Electron is the only reusable orbital-class small rocket. Capturing and reflying Electron‚Äôs first stage enables higher launch frequency without expanding production and lowers launch costs.](https://preview.redd.it/okycitpk5p3e1.png?width=1345&format=png&auto=webp&s=453be91a7aad8274d7fef195c42eeb1daf48add2)

Electron is a two-stage, small-lift launch vehicle that is able to carry around 300kg to Low-Earth Orbit. Its Rutherford engines are the first electric-pump-fed engine to power an orbital-class rocket. Electron is often flown with a kick stage or Rocket Lab's Photon spacecraft.¬†

Proven Reliability ‚Äì Electron has already flown 14 times this year, achieving record cadence, over the 10 times flown in 2023. Electron is now the 3rd most frequently launched rocket globally in 2024. 54 launches (50 successes, four failures \~ 92.5% success rate)

Responsiveness ‚Äì Electron can launch from three launch pads across two hemispheres, from LC1 A/B in New Zealand, Rocket Lab‚Äôs privately owned launch pad or from LC2 in Wallops, Virginia. This has been demonstrated recently with a HASTE launch in LC2 and an electron launch within 24 hours on Nov 24/25.

[üöÄ Literally to the Moon - Electron's Capstone Mission](https://preview.redd.it/hq5mcset5p3e1.png?width=1786&format=png&auto=webp&s=dee6c94313ff18c3c7a9c27bc28a84338d2094ac)

Small but powerful ‚Äì On June 28, 2022, Rocket Lab launched a CubeSat to the Moon - a pathfinding mission to support NASA‚Äôs Artemis program which will land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon.

**Electron‚Äôs existential crisis, or not?** ‚Äì While Electron has limitations in terms of carry capacity of 300 kg to LEO and the threat of SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 Transporter Rideshare missions, Electron‚Äôs reliability and responsiveness together with its tailor-made missions have continued providing strength in demand evident from the signing of multi-launch agreements with its customers (Synspective, Capella Space, Blacksky etc.) Many discuss the threat of Electron being replaced by larger rockets, such as SpaceX‚Äôs Transporter rideshares or even Neutron cannibalising Electron in the future. However, just like taking an Uber directly to your destination or the bus somewhere near but not quite your destination, Electron together with its kick stage provides unrivaled accuracy, hitting target orbits with pinpoint accuracy.

**Why Capella Space chose Electron over Rideshare** 

‚ÄúInstead of burning propellant to raise altitude, it‚Äôs far easier to simply be dropped off at a higher orbit by the launch vehicle. Being able to go higher than available rideshare missions was a major factor in Capella‚Äôs decision to pull Capella-9 from its planned launch and procure a dedicated ride from Rocket Lab for Capella-9 and Capella-10, which were launched in March 2023 on an Electron rocket to a targeted 600 km. This was also a major motivation behind the follow-on contract for four dedicated launches on Electron rockets for Acadia-generation satellites, the first of which launched to a targeted 640 km in August 2023‚Äù

[Continued Strong Demand for Electron](https://preview.redd.it/9hfpllwg6p3e1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=89128d9ce6e6660cdcb992ff6f3fdf0609146069)

The demand for Electron is also seen to be strong with the Average Selling Price increasing to what was $7.5 million to now $8.4 million. Furthermore, many of Electron‚Äôs direct competitors, mostly small launch ‚Äòaspirational‚Äô space companies have now been eliminated from the market.¬†

[ Astra Space Rocket 3 \(Dead\), Virgin Orbit LauncherOne \(Dead\), ABL Space RS1\(Dead\), Relativity Terran 1 \(Dead\), Firefly Alpha \(Dead Soon?\) ](https://preview.redd.it/57p1sfxr6p3e1.png?width=1795&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7b46dc23f26f9abd7236e9fd03fdbffc8789f8f)

It is NOT Rocket Science. Can‚Äôt really say that in this industry. Entrants to the small launch space have not fared well, many attribute it to a lack of demand as some pivot to larger launchers but in truth it seems that Electron has cemented its place as THE small launch provider.

**2. Haste**

https://preview.redd.it/v3l86x177p3e1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=30266164d98e447732f8e430c99bb58d3a4b887c

HASTE is a suborbital testbed launch vehicle derived from Rocket Lab‚Äôs heritage Electron rocket. HASTE provides reliable, high-cadence flight test opportunities needed to advance hypersonic and suborbital system technology development. Hypersonic speed is at least five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5 and above

[Types of Adaptions of Electron payload for HASTE vs Space-Based Orbital Electron](https://preview.redd.it/x7qeoojz7p3e1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b1fcbe1a09d5f8d9e6e7f8299e281d99bf53245)

# 

From air-breathing and glide payloads to ballistic and future technologies, HASTE is a cost-effective and responsive hypersonic testbed that enables precision payload delivery for every mission.

[Leidos was awarded $334M air-breathing hypersonic system contract](https://preview.redd.it/rzpb8vfp8p3e1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=4995acc3b4ce982c65204c7969cc708a73981ec1)

Rocket Lab has had two HASTE missions so far, with the first HASTE mission on 17 June 2023 for Leidos. Leidos was awarded [$334M air-breathing hypersonic contract](https://www.leidos.com/insights/leidos-awarded-334m-air-breathing-hypersonic-system-contract) in 2022.

Russia has already demonstrated its use of the Khinzal hypersonic missile in Ukraine and the Pentagon‚Äôs warning to the congress that China already possesses the world‚Äôs leading hypersonic arsenal, the United States still does not possess its own arsenal of hypersonic missiles. As the US plays catch up, Rocket Lab stands to win, with at least another 3 HASTE missions for Leidos for 2024/2025  as part of the MACH-TB (Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed program.

Instead of highlighting how large the Total Addressable Market hypersonics could be, it would be more useful to highlight the innovation of Rocket Lab and also management‚Äôs ability to understand its technologies to adapt and create new use cases.

**3. Space Systems**

[We Don't Just Build Rockets in this Lab](https://preview.redd.it/03v1c2fk9p3e1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=27f2b92571ecd7eb36c692bb14caf370aa86db7b)

While rockets are really nice to look at, it is important to understand that launch business makes up only 20-30% of revenue of Rocket Lab, with Space Systems making up the majority of revenue contribution. Rocket Lab‚Äôs expansion into Space Systems through in-house capabilities or through acquisition is what seems to be most under-rated by investors/analysts.

**THIS IS WHERE I AM REALLY BULLISH. RECURRING REVENUE. MORE STUFF IN SPACE = MORE RECURRING REVENUE**

Starlink satellites have a lifespan of about five years. After which it will re-enter the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere and be destroyed. Satellites need replenishing, and companies are heading towards mega constellations to provide their services, Rocket Lab will either manufacture, provide components, flight software or even deploy them with Neutron. With the space economy projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030, and $1.8 trillion by 2035. Rocket Lab‚Äôs position as an end-to-end space company seems like a no-brainer as long as the company is able to capture a portion and with more than 1,700 satellites launched to orbit with Rocket Lab technology already, it seems to be on the right path. Some highlights of Rocket Lab‚Äôs space systems.

**a. Reaction Wheels**

[Love that we now ship pallets of reaction wheels to constellation customers. - Peter Beck](https://preview.redd.it/fofd4136bp3e1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=26d87d2a06b834269b21f22762292abb2dd2e37a)

A satellite typically needs at least three reaction wheels to control its movement along the X, Y, and Z axes. However, satellites often have four reaction wheels for redundancy

Deal already signed with a [single confidential mega constellation customer ](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/24/rocket-lab-reveals-big-supplier-deal-with-mystery-mega-constellation-customer/#:~:text=In%20its%20data%20sheet%20on,the%20base%20price%20at%20%24100%2C000)for thousands of reaction wheels per year. If you‚Äôre wondering who it could be‚Ä¶ [Amazzz](https://www.youtube.com/live/wmmNuU8-Tr8?si=xpO2MeoKJ2KyHw5F&t=1218)

Amazon‚Äôs Kuiper constellation will have an initial 3,236 satellites Which likely will need replenishing every five years as well. That‚Äôs a good stream of recurring revenue for reaction wheels alone.

[\~4,000 to 5,000 satellites launched annually in 2030 - McKinsey](https://preview.redd.it/lmb1i4tmcp3e1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e5378628bdb2ce794333f878b8f54c530979638)

McKinsey anticipates in the base case, 27,000 active satellites in orbit by the end of 2030, almost a four-fold increase from today. To maintain that number at the assumed lifespan, there would need to be 4,000 to 5,000 satellites launched per year. In the high-demand scenario, in which nearly all proposed constellations materialize, McKinsey would expect to see more than 65,000 satellites, including many heavier ones, on orbit by 2030.

**b. Space Grade Solar**

[In 2022, Rocket Lab acquired leading satellite solar power producer SolAero Technologies. ](https://preview.redd.it/boenu4xrdp3e1.png?width=921&format=png&auto=webp&s=35bc3927f9baa504c4f498ec3ffddf844c274cd2)

Satellites need power. With the acquisition of Sol Aero, Rocket Lab is now one of the few space grade solar providers. Already there are more than 1,100 satellites in space powered by Rocket Lab solar products. The company has also been [awarded $23.9million](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-11-25/us-finalizes-awards-to-bae-systems-rocket-lab-for-semiconductor-chips) to boost the company‚Äôs production of solar cells by 50% over the next three years.

**c. Separation Systems**

[No separation anxiety - Example of Rocket Lab‚Äôs Separation System](https://preview.redd.it/i8s75ussep3e1.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a75dda0512efd875bab92e6f01da9ca86fee5d96)

In 2021 Rocket Lab acquired Planetary Systems Corporation which has designed, built, and delivered separation systems for more than 20 years with a 100% success rate - no product has ever failed to operate in flight. With the scale and resources of Rocket Lab behind the team, we are now making separation systems available globally at scale.

**d. Space Software**

[In October 2021, Rocket Lab acquired Advanced Solutions, Inc \(ASI\), a Colorado-based aerospace engineering firm delivering mission proven space software, mission simulation, and testing solutions.](https://preview.redd.it/quczg7jyep3e1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=98c4593cdd1a44f7e5e3377c5ea0b8be3c21a571)

As part of the end-to-end service, Rocket Lab also provides software and operation for customer satellites.

The vertically integrated and end-to-end space service Rocket Lab provides will allow customers who are looking to provide a service from space do so without any knowledge of building and operating spacecrafts.

Right now companies like Varda are still space companies applying pharmaceutical and life science applications, and even have outsourced [Rocket Lab will to conduct in-space operations](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-completes-second-spacecraft-for-varda-space-industries-advancing-in-space-manufacturing/), reentry positioning maneuvers, and deorbiting to recover Varda‚Äôs capsule while they attempt to develop the own in-house solutions. However, Rocket Lab's end goal as THE end-to-end space provider, is for companies with no knowledge of building or operating spacecrafts contracting Rocket Lab for its services.

**4. Catalysts**  
Written so much and I have not even covered Neutron, Space Race, Possibility with Mars Sample Return, NSSL Neutron On-ramping, SDA Contracts, Human rated Neutron launches. I'll point over to [Dave G Investing's video](https://youtu.be/rt4_g87TxL8?si=PHAi9oegs_13u0AL) on the potential nearer term catalysts, I think he covers it in great detail.

Further term growth opportunities include Neutron signing more commercial launches to deploy constellations or even taking on some contracts to help deploy Kuiper if any of their launch providers for their 83 launches fail to deliver. Also as SPB mentioned, Neutron‚Äôs success will then allow for Rocket Lab to develop its own constellation. These catalysts really show the uncapped potential of the company, which makes valuing the company today extremely difficult, which is why I will be holding my shares, at least a good amount of it till 2030.

**5. Conclusion**

Trust in SPB. He knows Rockets. Watch Wild Wild Space on HBO for those who haven't.

Rocket engineer at heart, he developed Electron with less than $100 million compared to rockets like Virgin Orbit's LauncherOne estimated to be over $1 billion and still failed.

RKLB_posts.csv,Let's talk MSR and competing proposals...,"MSR. So hot right now. For better or worse, I wanted to share my opinions on the likelihood RKLB gets the MSR mission.

I realize we only have the abstracts for the proposals, but it should be enough to tell us who is taking this seriously. I'm honestly flabbergasted at some of the proposals, and I've attempted to summarize the abstracts even further below. You'll quickly see that it's a two, MAYBE three horse race... and RKLB is in it.

* Rocket Lab: ""We put a lot of effort into this proposal, and intend to show you just why we are the perfect choice. We can and have done nearly everything you're asking a company to do, we have a proven track record and a reliable path to mission success, and we can do it faster and cheaper than anyone else.""

* Lockheed Martin: ""Sure, we can do it for your max budget and.... sometime... before 2040. We have lots of experience with this stuff, dude. We've partnered with you before and we sure liked all the cash you filled our coffers with. Give us the contract and we will do the bare minimum to meet any of your needs. But we're pals, man! Like, our relationship goes WAY back... and don't forget the lobbying money we spend! So... can we have the money now? kthx""

* Blue Origin: ""So you're already building SLS and HLS, so...let's like... leverage those options, and then you won't even need to worry about how many samples you can return! *SLAPS 4 BILLION DOLLAR ROCKET* This baby can fit SO MANY mars samples inside of it!! We can't talk about schedule because uh.... that's kind of on you (wink wink) but uh.... we think by using these options you might be able to accelerate your schedule? But listen to THIS... we've got a couple of super brainy Ph.D.'s leading a ""team"" of EXPERTS looking into all of this, and they have a whole 50 years of combined experience on mars missions! So uh.... pick us, and then we might actually take any of this seriously.""

* Quantum Space: ""We develop spacecraft. Or.... I guess... we're trying to. We haven't had any success at all, but we're smart cookies who think outside the box!! We think we came up with a novel but quite difficult approach to trajectory and spacecraft needs by basically doing a lunar orbit rendezvous and hand off of the samples to another vessel before returning to Earth. Sure, we know you're probably going to call this bullshit, be we prefer to call it a ""disruptive concept"""".

* Aerojet Rocketdyne: ""We're smart cookies and we take this seriously. We've already identified areas where we can reduce the mass of the theoretical MAV and SRL, and that would allow us to use existing technologies to get the lander on the surface. We've been doing this a long time and have a lot of success, and we've already started to figure out which propulsion technologies would fit into a mission like this or which would need to develop further. We really want to use the skycrane to land the MAV, and will likely concentrate all efforts on that front since it would speed things up considerably. The reduced mass MAV and SRL will allow us to return plenty of samples.""

* Northrop Grumman: ""So we are like, quite competent in propulsion, and we've been doing this stuff for like, a really long time. We will do some uh.... engineering.... and uh, we want some government money so we can keep developing our solid rocket motors. And then you can use them for this mission!! :D""

* SpaceX: ""Uhh... we're already going to mars. We don't know when, but.... we can just pick up your samples for you while we're there, and then charge you a shit ton of money for the privilege :) Sit back and relax!""

* Whittinghill Aerospace: ""We're a cutting-edge tech firm out of the Midwest, awaiting imminent patent approval on the next generation of ~~radar detectors (D2D)~~ MON hybrid rocket motors that have both huge military and civilian applications. Now, right now John, our stock trades over the counter at $0.10.... but we..... oh shit.... wrong number.""


So, alright then. We have some serious proposals, and we have some jokers. I think there are a few that you can remove straight off the bat. Whittinghill and Quantum Space. One is an engineering company, and the other makes spacecraft. Lots of companys do both, these companies do just the one, and are both quite small and not in a position to handle such an important contract. That widles us down from 8 to 6.

This is where it gets a little tricky, since we don't know what's actually in the proposals... all we have are the abstracts. But taking things at face value, there are a few additional proposals that don't really seem to be taking it seriously, or don't really offer any value to NASA by choosing them. Those options are Lockheed, BO, and Northrop. Yes, THOSE BIG THREE. Why? Lockheed is basically ""max budget, max timeline"". What incentive does that provide? BO relies on SLS sticking around AND on HLS sticking around.... which kinda feels like a complication of.... the SpaceX option? And Northrop can just pound sand. Their abstract is one of the worst in the whole bunch outside of Whittinghil and Quantum IMO. 

So... that leaves THREE actual ""competitors"" IMO. Let's dig into those. Rocket Lab, SpaceX, and Aerojet Rocketdyne, so let's start with Rocketdyne. They've put in the effort here, and have the company heritage to execute on their claims. They want to leverage existing technologies, while developing their rocket motors further so they can reduce the weight of the MAV. Smart cookies here, but no real promise on a timeline. Just vague talks of being able to 'accelerate' the timeline if they CAN leverage the skycrane the way they want. Solid choice, reasonable value to NASA. I give this option a B+.

Now let's talk about SpaceX. It's not so much a 'proposal' for a 'mission' as it is like, ""Hey Jim, I'm running to the store anyways. Want me to bring you back anything? Oh...no... I'm not going now. I'm going in like... 5-9 years... or something?"". It's not a BAD proposal, but without knowing the financials it's hard to say how likely NASA would be to choose this option. They're relying on HLS anyways, so if Starship is gonna be a thing, this could make sense. But they lose a lot of control, and who knows if their proposal is for a $9B budget and a return date in 2038? They don't say, and I don't think NASA will like losing that much control and influence on the mission. I give this option a C-. Feasible, but probably not NASA's best actual choice, since it really strips them of their autonomy.

And finally.... Rocket Lab. They can do it for under $2B on a fixed-price contract WAY earlier than NASA's requirement of 2040. They've built spacecraft, sent spacecraft to the moon using multiple trajectory burns, they've engineered and built spacecraft busses, reaction wheels, solar panels, navigation and guidance systems, rocket engines and rockets themselves, and they've even returned a capsule to earth that had samples inside of it already. They can do the entire mission, end-to-end, for 18.1% of NASA's budget, and get the samples here almost a DECADE earlier than required. Even IF NASA choose RKLB and they didn't deliver as promised, NASA would have SO much damn cash left to pursue other avenues (and presumably, almost a decade to do it...) that it would seem almost criminal for them not to select the RKLB proposal. RKLB could fail and they'd still be likely to succeed ""Hey Elon... grab us some samples on your next 2038 Mars mission... here's $5B"". Cool. NASA still got the samples back before 2040 and for $7B. I give this proposal an A-. The only thing keeping me from an A or an A+ is that Neutron isn't flying yet.

So, those are my big three that have a chance, but I personally think it boils down to Rocket Lab and Aerojet Rocketdyne. SpaceX is going to mars anyways, and like I mentioned above, we could just pivot to having them bring us back some samples a decade from now if things don't otherwise work out. For that reason, I give the SpaceX proposal a 15% chance of being selected, the Rocketdyne proposal a 40% chance of being selected, and RKLB a 45% chance of being selected. I'm assuming all the proposals I 'eliminated' earlier have a 0% chance, but that's likely not true. However, I wanted to simplify this.

So, from my seat, RKLB is actually the MOST likely proposal to be selected for MSR? Why? Execution, cost, and timeline PLUS the ability to NASA to pivot to SpaceX in the 2030's if necessary. Rocketdyne a close second.

RKLB_posts.csv,An Observation ,"I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre all excited about another monster trading session after a surreal run up.  I‚Äôm probably not the only one wondering each week if, and when, the eventual pull back is going to happen..  only to see the stock go higher.

I thought I‚Äôd share a quick story of an interaction earlier today to give some context to what many of us wrestle with.

I went to PT this morning, and we were shooting the breeze about life when she asked what I was up to.  We‚Äôre pretty good friends at this point, and the conversation drifted towards investing since it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm passionate about.  Naturally, Rocket Lab came up, and she was genuinely curious so I spent some time sharing the bullet points about the company, Peter Beck, the sector, etc.  The other two providers that were nearby joined in the conversation since they didn‚Äôt have clients at the time, and so I talked to them about it too.

What was absolutely fascinating to me was that none of them had ever heard of Rocket Lab.  These are intelligent, accomplished, capable medical professionals.  

People like to joke about you know it‚Äôs time to sell when you over hear Uber & Lyft drivers talking about a stock.  I think the opposite is true as well.  Anecdotally, outside of this sub, WSB, and X/twitter, there is practically no one in my professional or personal spheres that has heard of this company - unless I‚Äôve personally told them about it.  

My point is..  the recent run up as been incredible, and while there is a very real possibility of a drawback in the near future, especially for some unforeseen news or black swan event, this company is still one of the best kept secrets.  

Of course I could be wrong, and there is a lot of risk ahead and plenty that could go badly..  However, I think this is still just the initial wave crashing upon the shoreline.  Once more people clue in, it‚Äôs going to be interesting.

I‚Äôd be very curious how many folks on this sub have had anyone tell them about RKLB, and not the other way around.

In the case of one company regarding potentially unlocking direct communications and the other one , the alternative to SpaceX on launch. So those are the two. They‚Äôre not really profitable yet, but they have the market valuation. The rest, they are mired in small subset of valuations?

First, ask yourself: If you already owned the stock, would you sell it now? If the answer is no because you think the price will continue to rise, then why wouldn‚Äôt you buy more now? If you believe in the company‚Äôs long-term future, the recent run-up shouldn‚Äôt deter you.

Remember, investors are in it for the long haul. Traders are the ones making short-term moves. And if you‚Äôre asking a biased community for financial advice, it‚Äôs probably a sign that you‚Äôre not the best trader. Timing the market is notoriously difficult, and most people don‚Äôt get it right.

So instead of focusing on short-term fluctuations, ask yourself if Rocket Lab‚Äôs long-term vision aligns with your investment goals. Don‚Äôt try to time the market‚Äîmake decisions based on your confidence in the company‚Äôs future.

As always, do your own research and assess your personal financial situation.

Neutron and a mega constellation, along with a thriving space systems business, is a ways away. That's the carrot at the end of the stick. Even so, that can't be the end of the story. I find it difficult to believe that is as far as it goes.

RKLB_posts.csv,Space operations and management constellation?,"With the imminent retirement of the NASA ""Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System"" (TDRS), I have been wondering if some sort of space operations and management constellation might be a good candidate for Rocket Lab's first space services constellation?

First some background courtesy of Chat GPT:

**What is the TDRS?**

The *Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System* (TDRS) is NASA's communication network used to support real-time data and command transmission between Earth and spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO), such as the International Space Station and the Hubble Space Telescope. Operating since 1983, TDRS consists of multiple geostationary satellites and ground stations, providing near-continuous coverage.

The system facilitates telemetry, tracking, and data transfer, enabling critical operations for various NASA missions. NASA is transitioning to commercial services as TDRS ages.

**What is the CSP?**

The *Communication Services Project* (CSP) is a NASA initiative aimed at transitioning from government-owned satellite communication systems, such as the TDRS, to commercially operated services. The CSP involves partnerships with private companies to develop and demonstrate advanced communication capabilities for space missions. These capabilities include satellite relay, ground-to-space communications, and data transmission, ensuring reliable and cost-effective support for NASA's future needs. The project is a cornerstone of NASA's strategy to leverage private-sector innovation for space infrastructure.

**What is SSA?**

*Space Situational Awareness* (SSA) refers to the ability to track and understand the behavior of objects in space, including active satellites, debris, and other spacecraft. SSA involves monitoring their positions, predicting potential collisions, and assessing risks to space operations. It is crucial for satellite operators, governments, and military organizations to ensure safe and sustainable use of Earth's orbits, particularly as space becomes increasingly crowded with new satellites and debris. SSA data is gathered using ground-based and space-based sensors, radar, and optical systems.

**What is a SON?**

*Satellite Operations Network* (SON) refers to the integrated system of ground stations, communication links, and software infrastructure used to manage, monitor, and control a satellite or a constellation of satellites. The SON ensures the execution of mission commands, monitors telemetry data, and facilitates two-way communication between satellites and operators. Advanced SONs often include automation, real-time data analysis, and tools for handling large-scale constellations with minimal human intervention.

**What is STM?**

*Space Traffic Management* (STM) refers to the planning, coordination, and execution of operations to ensure the safe and sustainable use of Earth‚Äôs orbital environment. It encompasses tracking space objects (satellites, debris), avoiding collisions, managing orbital slots, and coordinating launches. STM combines policy frameworks, technical systems (like SSA), and international cooperation to mitigate risks from space congestion and orbital debris, ensuring efficient and safe space operations for both public and private entities.

**What would you call a combined SSA, SON and STM system?**

A combined system integrating *Space Situational Awareness* (SSA), *Satellite Operations Network* (SON), and *Space Traffic Management* (STM) could be called an *Integrated Space Operations and Management System* (ISOMS) or *Unified Orbital Management Network* (UOMN).

Such a system would unify tracking, operational control, and traffic management functions, ensuring seamless coordination between monitoring orbital environments, controlling satellite constellations, and preventing collisions or other orbital conflicts. This integration would enable efficient and secure satellite operations in increasingly congested space environments.

Thanks Chat GPT!

I'm not suggesting that Rocket Lab will join other commercial entities participating in the CSP, there are already plenty of big names there including Kuiper and Starlink. Perhaps Rocket Lab may partner with some of them. But it occurs to me that if you want to build an end-to-end space company, that designs, builds and operates customer constellations, you'll need some of the same functionality that the TDRS provides NASA - and you may not want to rely on other commercial CSP entities to provide it.

Back over to Chat GPT:

**Describe a UOMN constellation? How many satellites? How many ground stations? What orbits required?**

A *Unified Orbital Management Network* (UOMN) constellation would likely require a combination of LEO (Low Earth Orbit) and MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) satellites to cover both tracking and communication needs. The number of satellites would depend on coverage requirements, but a network of 30‚Äì50 satellites could be sufficient for global tracking and communication.

Ground stations would be strategically placed worldwide, with at least 5‚Äì10 ground stations for redundancy and global reach. The system would also need robust inter-satellite links, especially for real-time traffic management and command/control capabilities.

Thanks Chat GPT!

OK so Rocket Lab would need some help with ground stations, and whilst they have their own RF space radios, they may also want to pick up some space optical expertise. With $300M in the Mergers & Aquisitions kitty, perhaps there are some targets?

On launch, it also appears they are willing to make trade offs in medium launch to capture the most profitable end of heavy launch in pursuit of their long term goals. That seems to leave the door wide open for Rocket Lab. Interesting comments:

RKLB_posts.csv,Valuation ,"I keep seeing comments that RKLB is cheap and SpaceX is overvalued. Or other commentary that sounds like it is based on faith and not thought out metrics. Full disclosure I'm bullish on both. 

Morgan Stanley has probably one of the most publicly available in-depth analysis of SpaceX value. They note that 60% of the value is in Starlink. That would make SpaceX rocket side about a $75B valuation. Given their launch revenue was estimated to be $5.5B for 2024 that is a revenue multiplier of 13.6x. Apply that to Rocket lab and you get a valuation of $10b on $245m of revenue and you have a revenue multiplier of 40.8x. 

RocketLab's launch business is three times more expensive to buy than SpaceX's right now. Not sure SpaceX is overvalued (on launch).  Starship is arguably a much bigger leap than Neutron (new model vs providing a launch alternative to existing model). So, not sure how SpaceX can be called overvalued and at the same time saying RocketLab has room for another 150% gain ($50 share).

If this is correct (and it was quick and sort price analysis), does RKLB benefit from IPO access and demand for the sector that cannot be easily accessed via SpaceX? Is there something else driving the multiplier difference? Yes both companies do more than launch, but one has turned that into revenue while the other is just starting down that path. And that portion of the valuation is pulled out of SpaceX in the above analysis and assumed to be $0 for RKLB. 

Maybe that's the difference. That the market is already valuing the non-launch business at even more astronomical multipliers than SpaceX's non-launch business.",61,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1gs6fmx/valuation/,0.8615,0.063,0.912,0.025

I was buying at $3.5 - $6 and after a healthy increase I sold some around $10.  I still have a good amount and I‚Äôm accumulating again and here is why‚Ä¶

This latest launch was by a ‚Äúconfidential customer‚Äù and the new contracts for neutron are also from a ‚Äúconfidential customer.‚Äù  I knew they would beat earnings since the new customer wasn‚Äôt factored into the earnings forecast during the Q3 presentation so I bought a bunch more and calls just before earnings.  Be prepared to see ‚Äúconfidential customer‚Äù a lot from Rocket Lab in the future.  A lot of developed countries, especially in Europe, do not see Trump as an ally and now that Leon is part of the government they want to distance themselves from him and SpaceX.  If Trump installs large tariffs then you can easily predict a trade war.  The faster these other countries get up their own internet satellite systems the better.  Not only do they not want to rely on Starlink for secure communications, they don‚Äôt want to rely on SpaceX to put up their satellites.  This is where Rocket Lab will be taking full advantage of having non-U.S. based launch facilities.  For those that have been here awhile there were rumors of Rocket Lab acquiring a constellation builder in the U.K.  I fully expect that to happen now to service their European and Asian customers and be fully integrated from build to launch.   I bet we get news of that before the 4th Quarter earnings in February.  Several people that are very Pro SpaceX / Leon  won‚Äôt read this far and you will see responses from them below calling this bullshit and how SpaceX is far and away the only real private company option for other countries‚Ä¶.just watch.

My prediction is RKLB between $35 - $50 by the end of 2025 unless there is a black swan event.

The rate to borrow on [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rklb) for tomorrow is 3.3% APR. Now that's not really HIGH but it is much higher than it was the past week because the fee goes up when more people want to short it (read about it [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-loan-fee.asp)).  So more shorts interested in us.  The more shares short, the more downward pressure on the stock. 

I still see blanket 10M shares available short but I don't know where that info came from or if it's the 2 week lag that is often placed on the public info (and I don't have a subscription to the services that update it).  IBKR shows shares still available but that likely won't update until 7am EST tomorrow as well. 

There's too many brokers out there but if you are long the stock and you don't want your shares leant out (to be paid a portion of that 3.3% because brokers take their cut of course), you should google: ""\[insert your broker\] opt out of securities lending"". 

All the brokers think this is a good thing - [RH](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/stock-lending/), [Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/securities-lending), [Ally](https://www.ally.com/invest/self-directed-trading/securities-income-program/), [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/fully-paid-lending), etc. - Likely your broker has it too. They all ""want you to earn interest"" but to read up a bit more on [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitieslending.asp).. but they summarize to this:

So if you like it and want it to go up... decide what you want to happen.. don't let the brokers decide.. 

Clearly it's all our individual choices but just some information from the meme stock era that might help us all. 

Goodluck errybody.

RKLB_posts.csv,Positive press for Firefly and its posture for competition against Neutron and others‚Ä¶,"What are your thoughts on the the heavy recent investment in Firefly? They appear to be targeting similar market segments to both Rocket Lab and Intuitive Machines - anyone here concerned about the potential for their medium launch vehicle to outcompete Neutron or otherwise siphon market share? 

From the article:
‚ÄúIn the hierarchy of launch vehicles, these one-ton-class rockets fit in between a class of heavier rockets, such as those from SpaceX, United Launch Alliance, and Blue Origin, and smaller launchers like Rocket Lab's Electron. Rocket Lab is the clear leader in the lighter launch segment, while Firefly is well ahead of its cohort in the one-ton launcher race. Like Firefly, Rocket Lab is also working on its own medium-class rocket called the Neutron‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNASA has awarded Firefly three task orders under the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. Firefly will soon ship its first Blue Ghost lunar lander to Florida for final preparations to launch to the Moon and deliver 10 NASA-sponsored scientific instruments and tech demo experiments to the lunar surface. NASA has a contract with Firefly for a second Blue Ghost mission, plus an agreement for Firefly to transport a European data relay satellite to lunar orbit.

Firefly also boasts a healthy backlog of missions on its Alpha rocket. In June, Lockheed Martin announced a deal for as many as 25 Alpha launches through 2029. Two months later, L3Harris inked a contract with Firefly for up to 20 Alpha launches. Firefly has also signed Alpha launch contracts with NASA, NOAA, the Space Force, and the National Reconnaissance Office. One of these Alpha launches will deploy Firefly's first orbital transfer vehicle, named Elytra, designed to host customer payloads and transport them to different orbits following separation from the launcher's upper stage.

And there's the Medium Launch Vehicle, a rocket Firefly and Northrop Grumman hope to launch as soon as 2026‚Ä¶‚Äù",7,20,https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/firefly-aerospace-rakes-in-more-cash-as-competitors-struggle-for-footing/,0.9769,0.095,0.891,0.014

Sounds like the reaction wheels contract could maybe be for a Apple constellation rather than Kuiper

Options are very tempting at the moment given the run RKLB had this quarter. Every stock will have pullback. When it does, time value eat away potential profits.

Your best bet through earnings is to buy the stock and sell out of the money covered calls for November end. The money you make from the covered calls, you can put it back into RKLB to increase your share count. Don't despair if your options are called. Do it again.

Consider buying options when RSI goes below 40 and MACDs are in negative territory. This is where technical analysis will help you.

If the options you bought are expiring worthless, you giving free money to whales. A $1000 from you pocket may not seem much. But a hundred players like yourself giving free money to whales every week is Big Whale Money.

We are coming off a consolidation phase and a gap up occurred today. From a technicals point of view,

1. There was a shooting star candlestick pattern on 10/24. Stock dipped by about 15% from a high of 12.09 to a low $10.16 on 10/31.  After this it crossed $13.
2. No major catalysts during this period. 
3. MACD's are crossing over and turning positive

The setup is incredible going into the earnings. I love this uptrend and I am betting that SPB has some great news to share on the earnings call. IMO, There are people seeing ""A secular trend"" and that's the driver for this momentum.  I mentioned this in my previous post. Other than that, I have no inside information.

RKLB_posts.csv,Here's my take on Apple's $1.5 billion investment and the impact it could have on RKLB,"***\\!/ This is not financial advice \\!/***

For those who aren't aware already, Apple has just announced on Friday a $1.5 billion satellite investment with Globalstar to improve space-based communications for iPhones. The deal is expected to close on Nov. 5.

Here is all the information I could find in order to form a realistic expectation on the effects such a deal could have on RKLB.

First things first, Globalstar is the company with which Apple has been partnering with since 2022 to offer emergency services on its latest iPhones when terrestrial networks are unavailable. Globalstar is managing the constellation Apple uses to provide that service. It is specified in the deal that Apple will make cash payments of $1.1 billion to help Globalstar fund the new network of satellites but, it is also said that SpaceX is expected to begin launching those new satellites next year. It is important to note that Globalstar's constellation is in LEO (low-earth orbit) and that  their network does not \*yet\* provide more bandwidth-hungry services such as voice and broadband as of today.

**Back to 2022's subcontract with MDA:**

RocketLab is directly involved in Globalstar's ""old"" constellation because in 2022, RKLB was awarded a subcontract by MDA ""to¬†lead the design and manufacture of 17 spacecraft buses for Globalstar‚Äôs new Low Earth Orbit satellites"". MDA is the company that initially got the contrat to build those 17 new satellites. Rocket Lab is also developing the Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC) for the constellation. The Globalstar SOCC includes a continuous satellite control and monitoring using Rocket Lab‚Äôs MAX GDS, a constellation-class ground software solution that provides complete spacecraft command and control. What is also important to note is that the telemetry and control radio for all spacecraft will also be a C-band variant of Rocket Lab‚Äôs Frontier Satellite Radio (Frontier-C). Rocket Lab's Frontier Satellite Radios are Software-defined radio (SDR). SDRs are a radio communication system where components that conventionally have been implemented in analog hardware (e.g. mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, etc.) are instead implemented by means of software on a computer or embedded system. 

**What are spacecraft buses?:**

Spacecraft buses can be referred to as satellite platforms which are the support on which to mount instruments and the infrastructure for the mission such as power, communications to the ground and navigation. A spacecraft bus consists of everything needed to¬†transport, protect, and operate the payload. In our case, RKLB was in charge of the manufacturing of the satellite platforms in the 2022 contract and MDA was in charge of the payload which is the primary function of the satellite's mission. 

**MDA's new Aurora satellites:**

MDA announced their new Aurora satellite line in March 2024. Aurora is a new software-defined satellite product line which is basically a transition from analog to digital satellite technology. MDA has also made new partnerships with new companies to supply components for Aurora. 

Here's a list of a few partnerships I could find: 

1. Aerospacelab announced July 8, 2024 that it will provide more than 200 battery charge regulators for MDA Space‚Äôs Aurora satellites over a three-year period starting in 2026. These components are used to manage power distribution and battery charging in satellite systems. 
2. Airbus will supply more than 200 Sparkwing solar arrays that will be built on a designated line at Airbus' high-capacity production facility in Leiden, the Netherlands.
3. Switzerland‚Äôs Huber+Suhner was selected to supply more than 60,000 multi-channel radio frequency (RF). 

The list above refers to components that are used in the manufacturing of a satellite platform/satellite bus. If MDA was still using RKLB's satellite platforms, why would they buy components which are generally used for the making of the satellite platform and not the payload? 

Also, SDR setup involves an RF front-end connected to a computer that will perform the conversions from analog to digital. In other words and from my understanding, multi-channel radio refrequency (RF) is a component used in the making of a Software-defined radio (SDR). If MDA was still using RKLB's SDRs, why would they buy multi-channel frequency systems from another supplier? 

Obviously, I'm not an aerospace engineer or anywhere near that job industry, but prior to the launch of their new Aurora line, I personally think MDA needed RKLB's SDR to actually make their precedent satellite line ""Software-defined"". Since they've now developed their own fully software-defined satellite line, it doesn't seem like they'd still use RKLB's components. Also, the latest contracts for Aurora satellites do not mention any partnership with RKLB. In fact, MDA's press release in August 2023 about their contract with Telesat briefly mentions a new line of satellite and a transition from analog to software-defined satellites. It also seems like, by the recent partnerships MDA made for Aurora's components, that MDA is now making their very own satellite buses also. 

**From all the information above, here's what I think:**

1. It doesn't seem like RKLB is going to be the launch provider since SpaceX is already slated to begin launches in 2025. 
2. In November 2023, MDA received an Authorization to Proceed (ATP) contract from an undisclosed customer to start work on a new Non-Geostationary Orbit (NGSO) satellite constellation (valued at $180 million). The definitive contract for the full constellation (valued at around $750 million) is expected in 2024. We can hope for the unnamed customer to be linked to Apple's new investment since the contract and the constellation' valuations both make sense, price wise, with the total investment made by Apple's and the $1.1 billion payments that will be made to Globalstar in order to help them fund the new constellation. The timeline between the ATP with MDA and Apple's announcement for their new investment also both make sense. However, if that contract actually turns out to be tied to Apple's new investment, I'm not really optimistic on the fact that Rocket Lab is still involved in the spacecraft bus manufacturing.
3. Because Apple's main objective with their new investment is to improve space-based communications for iPhones, I see this new investment as an extension to their first partnership with Globalstar back in 2022. That being said, I think it would make sense if Globalstar continues to use Rocket Lab's constellation-class ground software for their new satellite constellation because from my understanding, the new constellation's purpose is to act as a complement to the one currently operated. 
4. Globalstar didn't want to elaborate on the upgrades their new constellation would bring to space-based communications on iPhones. By looking at RKLB's old press releases about the 2022 contract, I've found this very precise sentence: ""These new satellites and SOCC will augment Globalstar‚Äôs existing constellation delivering reliable mobile satellite voice and data services from space."" However, Globalstar's current constellation does not \*yet\* provide more bandwidth-hungry services such as voice and broadband as of today. Is it possible that the new satellites partly built by RKLB would provide such an upgrade to GlobalStar's currently offered services?

RKLB_posts.csv,Not astrology! Promise!!!  Just sharing what I have been watching on the latest uptrend‚Ä¶,"Not an astrologer.

(Post is) Not really a conversation starter or anything too noteworthy, but sharing because it does display strength and accumulation. 

Nfa though. I‚Äôm sharing something that reinforces my thesis. Rocket Lab will be 100$ a share and it won‚Äôt be a pump and dump (long time from now, but it‚Äôs happening).

This is how I know.

Connecting the chart / daily price action, and the accumulation that has happened on this uptrend... 

When share price has dipped to the low end of a range (chart flattens out for a week or so), I have noticed large scale orders spike (not retail buys, massive buys). Noticed the same thing when the candles trade sideways on each step of the staircase on this last rise. The large orders hit the tape on the lower end of the price range. Then, share price takes the next step up.

Like I said, nothing noteworthy. What it displays though can give you, us dumb money retail investors, a little more confidence in holding your shares. You selling isn‚Äôt going to really do anything to the price, not trying to sell you on my thesis‚Ä¶. but maybe it will help you not bail on an opportunity to change your financial situation without doing anything‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt get scared out of your position. 

The spikes on the price cost distribution chart display consolidation / institutional buying in at the low end of the trading range / building positions. 

To connect the images simply‚Ä¶

First image displays the daily chart, each candle is 1 day. The sideways price action is accumulation and is directly correlated to the spikes on the ‚Äúcost distribution chart in second image. Then the last image displays the order flow for today. Notice the large scale orders. That is not retail investors. That is institutional buying and they hold their shares for a very long time. This allows share price to keep going up. Gradually, and not without dips.

Blackrock owned 4.9% of the company (just under disclosure requirements / 13 g). They bought another 1.1% of the company (disclosed last week, think they have 15 -30 days to file the 13). Yes they own everything, but a ~6% position is not to be ignored.

More institutions will follow. Current institutional ownership is just over 57%. Has increased steadily since the decrease in inst ownership when Kholsa distributed shares / lock-up ended. That was when price was ~ 4.50. 

If something negative happens (news / launch failure) look at the spike on the price cost distribution chart below the one we are at now. That is what stock astrologers call support levels. Buy more then. Usually takes another negative event to break that one.

This is the easiest money I have ever made. I‚Äôm just a science teacher. Money for nothing is welcomed. 

You do you, but hope you make money. There is plenty to go around. Would hate to see institutions make that money instead of you all reading Reddit posts on a Thursday night.

Let's take a look at Richard French, the Rocket Lab's man who is mentioned in the MSR studies abstracts of selected proposals published by NASA. Mr. French was mentioned in the Rocket Lab's news article of 2024/09/05 as a decorated NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) lead system engineer who, among other achievements, helped land the Curiosity Rover on Mars:, before moving to a managerial role at NASA HQ and later JPL's STO:

>Rocket Lab,¬†the global leader in dedicated small satellite launch, has appointed Richard French to the role of Director ‚Äì Global Government Launch Services. Joining Rocket Lab **following 12 years at NASA‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)**, Mr. French‚Äôs new role will see him focus on providing launch and on-orbit solutions for United States civil space customers such as NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as international civil space customers.

>In his previous role at NASA JPL, **Mr. French spent several years as an engineer working across various missions**, including the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission (for which he won the **NASA Honors Early Career Public Achievement Medal** for his work as **a lead system engineer**) **and** **helping to land the Curiosity Rover on Mars**. After moving into **a managerial role in the Space Technology Mission Directorate at NASA HQ, and then JPL‚Äôs Space Technology Office**, he made significant contributions in implementing public-private partnerships with companies like Blue Origin, Astrobotic Technology, and Made in Space, and helped stand up NASA‚Äôs first start-up accelerator program with Techstars.

>(...)

>‚ÄúRichard‚Äôs extensive experience at NASA and his work on commercial and government partnerships made him the obvious choice to lead government services at Rocket Lab,‚Äù says Lars Hoffman, Senior Vice President ‚Äì Global Launch Services. ‚ÄúRocket Lab is proud to offer frequent, reliable, and streamlined launch services to small satellite operators, and I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing¬†Richard expand on Rocket Lab‚Äôs premium experience for our government customers.‚Äù

>Mr. French says: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited for the opportunity to continue enabling government agency space missions, but this time from the industry side and with the leading dedicated small satellite launch provider. I‚Äôm looking forward to building on the already impressive capabilities of Rocket Lab for government missions and working with government agencies to better support the expansion of commercial space.‚Äù

Rocket Lab is up against companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and some smaller guys like Astra and Firefly Aerospace.
 
Obviously Musk is the big dawg of the commercial space sector, with a $210 billion valuation. They dominate the industry with cheap rideshare missions for small satellites, which is bad news for Rocket Lab since they‚Äôre targeting the same market. Pretty much‚Ä¶. SpaceX‚Äôs scale and success are the biggest threats to Rocket Lab, hands down‚Ä¶. especially with the funding they just pulled too.

Blue Origin, while worth around $12 billion because they have Bezos running the show, the company is absolute dogwater for now and 0 threat. They are yet to surpass a suborbital launch lmao.

Now, Astra and Firefly are smaller but focused on launching small satellites at low costs. They‚Äôre not doing as many launches as Rocket Lab, but they could be disruptive by offering cheaper alternatives in the future but for now it's nothing crazy.

One company in this whole commercial space industry that kinda made me pause was Virgins Orbit. To really understand Rocket Lab‚Äôs position, I started looking into Virgin Orbit‚Äôs story. Basically for some background, they were another promising company in the small satellite market, valued at around $200 million before going bankrupt in 2023. This got me thinking though‚Ä¶ was Virgin Orbit ever worth more? Turns out, at its peak, Virgin Orbit was valued at around $3.7 billion because of the hype around their air-launch system.

That‚Äôs when I started to feel a little nervous. If Virgin Orbit, a company once worth billions, could go bankrupt, what about Rocket Lab? With a current valuation of $5.5 billion, it‚Äôs not that far off. Given how tough the space industry is (super high costs, tons of competition, substantial loss when things go bad, etc), it‚Äôs a fair question to ask if Rocket Lab could face a similar fate.

After digging deeper (GPT search is goated for this), I found some key reasons Rocket Lab is way more robust and unlikely to follow in Virgin Orbit‚Äôs footsteps:

* Unlike Virgin Orbit, which struggled with consistent operations and reliability, Rocket Lab has a proven record of successful launches. As of now, Rocket Lab has completed dozens of successful Electron launches, building customer confidence and expanding its market share. Looking at Virgin Orbit‚Ä¶. Basically they had only completed a handful of launches and faced way more technical issues. Rocket Lab's reliability in delivering payloads on time and at a competitive cost is a significant advantage over the difficulties Virgin Orbit experienced.  
* Rocket Lab is not solely dependent on launch services. It has successfully diversified into spacecraft design, satellite components, and satellite management services, which provide additional revenue streams. This strategic diversification helps mitigate the risks associated with relying solely on launch operations, which was one of Virgin Orbit‚Äôs weaknesses. Virgin Orbit primarily focused on air launch technology.  
* Rocket Lab has future projects like the development of the Neutron rocket, which will allow it to compete in the medium-lift launch market, giving it access to larger payloads and way more lucrative contracts. At this point‚Ä¶ Virgin Orbit was still trying to establish itself in the smaller payload market when it encountered financial troubles (so they weren't even able to get past logistics). . Additionally, Rocket Lab has been working on reusability with Electron, which could further reduce costs and increase profitability over time, a significant factor that Virgin Orbit lacked.  
* Rocket Lab has raised significant capital and managed its finances well, with plans to grow its business strategically. Virgin Orbit, despite its initial $3.7 billion valuation, faced liquidity issues and struggled to raise funds, eventually leading to bankruptcy. Rocket Lab‚Äôs revenue has been growing steadily, and while it is not yet profitable, the company's long-term plans for increasing revenue through more launches, satellite services, and new rocket developments give it a clearer path to profitability than Virgin Orbit ever had.  
* The demand for small and medium satellite launches is growing due to the rise of satellite constellations for communications, earth observation, and defence. Rocket Lab is well positioned to capitalise on this, having established itself as a trusted provider. Virgin Orbit‚Äôs limited ability to scale and capture a significant portion of this growing market played a role in its downfall.

So yeah, while I had some initial concerns comparing Rocket Lab to Virgin Orbit‚Äôs downfall, it‚Äôs clear that Rocket Lab is in a much stronger spot

RKLB_posts.csv,In response to the bears (aka the liberal arts bull case for RKLB),"A few days ago I had an exchange with a guy who posted various pics Archimedes vs Raptor rockets.   A link to the thread ( https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/s/HOahYRJsur ), but the guy‚Äôs comments were deleted either by himself or the mods(?).  

In any event, it started out as just one of any number of posts going on about space x being so far ahead that nobody can compete.  I think the poster was a provocateur but also argued in good faith.  I found him to be broadly representative of a demographic of investor whose biases (technical snobbery and industry experience) are commonly found in arguments against Rocket Lab.  I think that those points are worth further discussion. 

I‚Äôm NOT an engineer (and this poster snidely pointed this out, in response to my comment that I don‚Äôt care about Archimedes looking like a wiry mess compared to Raptor).  I‚Äôm also not a quant of any type.  I focus on soft factors - culture, broad market structure, political and social movements.  I am a liberal arts shit head investor, and am proud to be one.  I was on NVIDIA in early 2022 (after many techies, yes,  but still before the market as a whole) because I read some novels about AI and read about GPT 3.  Not to toot my own horn, but focusing on soft factors like ‚Äúhow will other people perceive this technology?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhere are the potential bottlenecks in developing it?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat companies are critical to this but have relatively low overall public awareness?‚Äù were critical to pointing me to Nvidia.  Much of the same analysis points me to Rocket Lab.

‚ÄúRocket Lab is technically inferior to Space X‚Äù.  Nobody disputes this. I take it as a given.  There is a wide gulf.  But does it matter?  Only if the technological gap cannot be overcome in the long run.  Why would Space X have an insurmountable technological moat?  It could only be one of three reasons:

1. The tech is too hard to replicate
2. The talent for developing the tech will only be at Space X
3. Space X will drive its competitors out of business before they can attain technological parity. 

As to 1, this is not true.  Saturn V rockets have existed for like 50 years.  Building rockets is hard but it does not require any significant breakthrough in fundamental science to match Space X.  I think this is not controversial.  It‚Äôs a question of scaling, money, processes, quality control, not fundamental scientific knowledge. 

As to 2: the commenter argued something to the effect that given space X‚Äôs advantage, no engineer would want to work for RKLB. This , frankly , struck me as prime Boomer Logic.  We have seen time and again that top talent wants to take risks and get exposure to upside.  Yes many engineers like to work for a more established company, but many will simply want the challenge, glory, and financial rewards associated with working for start up (or in RKLBs case, a mature start up with room to run).  

As to 3: Beck himself often rightly points out that monopolies usually do not last in the long run.  While this is less true in extremely capital intensive industries , he is generally correct and his point is buttressed by 2 additional facts.  A) space is a national security issue and B) Space X is and must remain a privately held company ( if it is to continue to pursue its mars goal).

I asked the poster to tell me who controlled airplane manufacturing during World War 2.  He responded a small number of companies incestuously subcontracted with each other and later consolidated into a handful of mega contractors due to government intervention. He made my point for me.  Vital national defense concerns are never run by pure monopoly; oligopoly is the rule.  This is because the market is artificial.  The government cannot tolerate a single company having a chokehold on vital capacity such as launch and space systems manufacture.  It requires somewhat competitive bidding.  It requires redundancies.  It also requires its contractors to satisfy national security laws regarding sourcing, supply chain, secrecy, clearances, etc.  Rocket Lab has come farther than any of its direct competitors (other than, obviously, Space X) in terms of being able to satisfy the governments requirements and delivering a product that works as advertised.  At minimum, Rocket Lab can deliver components for other launch providers ; the best case is that it can be one of 3-4 major government contractors in terms of taking payloads into orbit. 

The private vs public structure is also quite important.  Public companies are subject to disclosure laws that do not apply to private companies.  Control is dispersed, not concentrated in one person or small group.  This is a superior governance structure for the purposes of winning public confidence and political support.  Space X cannot go public in the near term because its stated goal of going to Mars will be severely compromised by introducing any form of outside governance.  I do take Musk at his word; mars is THE objective. Thus, it must remain in the hands of an idiosyncratic billionaire with many political enemies.  All the more reason for US and world governments to foster competition and incubate alternatives. 

None of this is to say that rocket lab will come out as one of the favored group of competitors- it is still a long, hard road with a lot of risk.  But I do not buy the thesis that SpaceX is untouchable and I do believe that RKLB is one of the top contenders.",104,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1g8mmdo/in_response_to_the_bears_aka_the_liberal_arts/,0.9926,0.122,0.802,0.076

Any newbs out there that don‚Äôt know this, RocketLab last year had had to punt being on boarded because they no longer had a credible path to launch in 2024.

I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious right now that a path to launch in 2025 is extremely credible and in a years time they should be scoring some of these contracts.

These are yearly awards, so for shit and giggles let‚Äôs say Neutron scores half these launches.

4 launches at probably 70 to 80 million (DoD are extra juicy compared to a standard 55 million dollar launch.) That revenue is what RocketLab has made this entire year so far. 

I get distracted dreaming about MSR and the current stock price, but Neutron scaling is such a big deal. So much Cheddar.

You, I, analysts, pundits, space enthusiasts, or market experts don't decide what a stock is worth. Only the market decides what stocks are ""worth"". And currently it's saying that RKLB is worth 5B today not because of what it's actually intrinsically worth, but because that the chance of it being worth 25, 50, 100B+ in a few years is becoming more and more likely.

A lottery ticket is a piece of paper worth nothing intrinsically. You don't buy it for the value of the paper. You buy it because it comes with the opportunity for it to later actually be worth a large amount of money.

I'd like to invest much more deeply, but when I analyze it, it feels as though the wealth created by this company is maybe 20 years away, rather than life-changing money that could be realized in the next ten, in which case, maybe it's better I put my money into an index. This isn't a criticism of the company at all, but is more based on the complexity/risk of the tech and the maturity of the market.

RKLB_posts.csv,Apparently SpaceX is afraid of competition‚Ä¶Rocket Lab has a great opportunity here.,"I‚Äôm pretty excited about the advancements in rockets that SpaceX has created.  I have Starlink and it works well.  SpaceX has been so far out in front that one would think they wouldn‚Äôt be afraid of competition but they clearly are.  This is an actual filing by SpaceX.  It is clear that their CEO thinks they should be the only game in town.  Why would he care what ASTS stock has done when TSLA stock was one of the best from 2010-2020?  He basically burned $34B buying Twitter  which is over 6X the market cap of Rocket Lab or ASTS.  He could have probably tried to buy both by way overpaying and he still would have done better than buying Twitter.  For some people it is never enough I guess to win‚Ä¶it‚Äôs about trying to make sure others lose.

RKLB_posts.csv,"If Trump wins, I'm selling.","I started thinking about the election and How it could affect Rocket Lab. And it dawned on me. Trump and Elon are best buddies. Of course Elon is going to use a Trump administration to kill off competition. Trump will direct every mission, NASA and DOD to SpaceX. He could even use the EPA to deny launch permits to any other company (who cares if it's BS, this is Trump world). This could kill Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, Axiom, Sierra, Relativity and any company that could compete with SpaceX in the future. This would be a tragedy for the whole industry that is just getting started. ULA will probably survive because they have been around the longest and have their own friends on capitol hill. But it will just be those two around SpaceX and ULA under Trump, that's my prediction.

On the Flip side if Kamala gets in I think they will actively divest from SpaceX wherever they can, due to Elon dislike. They'll be stuck using Dragon for a while because it's the most proven vehicle in the US (RIP Starliner). But I could see Dream Chaser getting another look from NASA. Neutron could get preferential treatment over Falcon 9 just to screw with SpaceX. A lot of competition could thrive under a democratic administration.

It's not exactly a smoking gun, but with just under 6 weeks between RL's proposal being accepted and Nelson saying that, it doesn't take a lot of squinting to see that there is a reasonable likelihood that Nelson is referring to Rocket Lab's new proposal which leverages every single unique mission they've ever done as a resume. For a bid of $2b and sample return by NLT Sept '33, this is incredibly ambitious for RL, I think it will be incredibly difficult to pull it off, but I'd be ecstatic to see it happen.

RKLB_posts.csv,A revelation I‚Äôve come to realise,"One of the biggest unknowns we‚Äôve had about Neutrons commercial success, is how well it will actually compete with Falcon 9. I for example, have always been hopeful, but a bit unsure about the fact that Neutron can only put 13 Tons into LEO in reusable configuration, compared to a much higher offering from Falcon 9.

Until the penny dropped that Falcon 9 is a mature design that‚Äôs been in production and service for well over a decade, and has seen many iterations and evolutions over it‚Äôs life.

I searched it up, Falcon 9s first ever iteration ‚Äúv1.0‚Äù could only put 9 tonnes into LEO, and it wasn‚Äôt reusable. The second iteration ‚Äúv1.1‚Äù could put 13 tonnes into LEO, and wasn‚Äôt reusable. It wasn‚Äôt until v1.2 came about in 2015 that it could then put 18.5 tons into LEO in reusable configuration and 22.8 Tons into LEO as an expendable rocket. It then later got refined into its next iteration ‚ÄúBlock 5‚Äù, but it‚Äôs payload capacity stayed the same, and the en you‚Äôve got Falcon Heavy which obviously has the higher capacities again.

So when you compare this to Neutron, it‚Äôs starting out brilliantly already. Considering Neutron is a foetus and Falcon 9 is a fully matured vehicle by now, and even so, F9 in its current state can only put 5.5 more tons into orbit than Neutron can (with both in LEO reusable configuration respectively). 

It‚Äôs safe to assume that as Neutron and Archimedes go through the development process and receive updates/iterations as it goes through its life and matures, that Neutron will be a very strong contender to Falcon 9. I mean, we already know that Archimedes in it‚Äôs current stage of life, will be operated at pretty low stress levels. And even at low stress levels, it‚Äôs starting considerably further ahead than where Falcon 9 started its life. Over the years of neutron being in service, when Rocket Lab refine and improve on their base design of neutron, when they learn more about Archimedes and how far they can push it whilst still being reliable to launch again and again and again, it seems safe to assume that Neutrons payload capacity will see decent payload improvements.

But my main point to realise is that Neutron is starting its life, leaps and bounds ahead of where Falcon 9 started its life, in terms of payload capacity and the fact that it will be reusable right from the outset. Obviously, this isn‚Äôt all down to Peter Beck masterclass, it‚Äôs been over a decade since F9 came to life, and technology has moved on since then. Still though, with this in mind, I feel a lot more confident about the argument of ‚ÄúHow will Neutron compete with Falcon 9‚Äù. 

Will we see a neutron heavy? I doubt it but I‚Äôd love to be proven wrong in 5-10 years time. But with this in mind, not even taking into account that certain clients may pick rocket lab purely because it‚Äôs the only option that isn‚Äôt Elon Musk, AND the fact that Rocket Lab will offer end to end space services unlike SpaceX, AND the fact that Rocket Lab missions are tailored to their customers better and have a more precise orbit insertion, I think it‚Äôs pretty reasonable to assume that Neutron will at the very least, give Falcon 9 a good run for their money. 

The only thing that does still worry me slightly is that Falcon 9 has more than paid off for it‚Äôs self by now, so SpaceX will be able to price gouge/undercut Rocket Lab as much as they want (within reason), and Rocket Lab can only lower their prices so far to match it, after all, they have years of neutron service ahead of them to pay off the development costs.",59,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fttb0l/a_revelation_ive_come_to_realise/,0.9898,0.109,0.836,0.055
RKLB_posts.csv,Huge component of the business not yet factored into share price,"I wanted to point out something that others have mentioned before, particularly Vince is Bullish:

Peter Beck has said more than once that Rocket Lab is aiming to launch 50% of their rockets for customers and 50% of their rockets for themselves. This is because one of the primary purposes of their business is to create some sort of space infrastructure akin to SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink - some type of constellation that provides a service with high value for customers and high profit margins for Rocket Lab.

SpaceX‚Äôs valuation ballooned (almost doubled) to $200B since Starlink has come online.

When ASTS simply mentioned their constellation contract with AT&T, their market cap 10x‚Äôd in 3 months (before they had put anything into space).

Rocket Lab is fully vertically integrated (ASTS had to use a SpaceX rocket to get their first 5 satellites for AT&T into orbit). Once Rocket Lab is ready to begin building their own constellation, they‚Äôll be able to do it at significantly lower cost than ASTS.

The only reason Rocket Lab‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt moved on these repeated announcements of Peter Beck‚Äôs 50/50 plan for the company is that they haven‚Äôt announced exactly what their constellation will be yet.

But anyone that knows this company can pretty safely assume it‚Äôll be a success that drives huge profits.

Remember, ASTS moved 10x on news of a constellation. Rocket Lab has announced a constellation too but there‚Äôs been zero movement (recent movement is due to other reasons like Neutron progress and price upgrades).

Once they announce the purpose of their constellation and provide a roadmap with more details, the stock could easily 2-5x in a handful of months. This will almost certainly occur simultaneously with the first successful flight of neutron or shortly after (6-12 months).

RKLB_posts.csv,RKLB Short Term Bear Thesis (Long Term Bull),"The intention of this post is to outline why I consider RKLB to be an outstanding company with an overvalued stock price. I‚Äôve been lurking on this sub for quite some time, and I frequently see people making bold price projections for RKLB‚Äôs future stock price with little to no substance backing up their estimates. That being said, I would like to provide a detailed breakdown for why I believe RKLB‚Äôs fair value is approximately $6 per share right now. This is a short term (1 year or less) projection, not a long term projection. I look forward to hearing your feedback and seeing where we differ in opinion.

*Let‚Äôs start with the good stuff. This encapsulates basically everything but the stock price.*

**Strong Leadership**
Peter Beck is exactly the right person to be running this company. He has the perfect blend of intelligence, charisma, and modesty to make the company as successful as it has been. The track record of successful launches that RKLB has achieved is a tremendous achievement for someone that, unlike his main competitors (Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, Elon Musk), does not have more money than god. I also see no concerning loss of senior talent, and I've seen an ability to attract new talent in recent months. Quality leadership is the most important thing I look for in an investment, and RKLB appears to have that in spades.

**Successful Track Record**
As mentioned earlier, the track record RKLB has achieved with Electron has been spectacular. 53 launches with minimal failures speaks volumes about the quality of the engineering talent at RKLB. Unlike many other people that have a negative take on RKLB, I actually don‚Äôt think that Neutron will struggle to reach a successful track record of launches and profitability. The recent hot fire test of the Archimedes engine was impressive, and it appears RKLB is on track to meet their goals with Neutron.

**Positive Catalysts**
There are several catalysts which I believe could completely annihilate my expectations for RKLB‚Äôs stock to decline in the near to mid term. First, an overall increased interest in the space industry from the market as a whole. Markets are always looking for the next hot thing, and it‚Äôs entirely possible space could be that. Just like artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, SPACs, etc., the space industry at large could see a significant uptick in investor interest. This could lead to an increase in RKLB‚Äôs multiple and stock price without necessitating an increase in revenue or profitability. Secondly and tangentially, an IPO of SpaceX could greatly increase RKLB‚Äôs visibility in the market. I believe a SpaceX IPO would cause a rising tide that raises all ships in the space industry, and RKLB would benefit. Lastly, I believe RKLB has a substantial amount of ‚Äúmeme stock‚Äù potential. The company‚Äôs name has been spreading within the forums of people that invest in meme stocks, and it‚Äôs possible RKLB could be the next big one as many of those speculators lose faith in GME, AMC, etc.

*Now let‚Äôs talk about the negatives.*

**Revenue/Profitability**
I believe it is fairly easy to project out RKLB‚Äôs likely profitability over the next 1-3 years, and I don‚Äôt expect to see many positive surprises on either top line revenue or bottom line earnings. Revenue is rising, but predictably, and I don‚Äôt see any significant catalysts for revenue to surprise on the upside. The revenue isn‚Äôt explicitly a negative as revenue growth has been strong, but the stock price relative to revenue is beginning to become unsustainable. 

RKLB became public in 2021 through a SPAC so we can‚Äôt too far back with their financials. In 2020 with seven Electron launches, RKLB had $35MM in revenue or about $6MM per launch.  In 2021 with six launches, RKLB had about $62MM in revenue or about $10MM per launch. In 2022 with nine launches, RKLB had $211MM in revenue or about $23MM per launch. In 2023 with nine launches, RKLB had about $244MM in revenue or about $27MM per launch. For the last 12 months (June 2023-June 2024) across twelve launches, RKLB had about $326MM in revenue or about $27MM per launch. These numbers show strong growth in launch count, total revenue, and revenue per launch. As we all know, most of RKLB‚Äôs revenue is outside of launch services, but their ability to launch successfully is critical for their future ability to generate revenue and profitability across all their business lines. For the first half of 2024, RKLB had about $200MM in revenue and they are projecting about $100MM in the third quarter. For the full year, I am assuming they settle in around $400MM in revenue for the year. Very solid revenue growth compared to 2023.

That‚Äôs all positive, but the stock price as compared to that revenue is overheated, from my perspective. Based on most recent valuations, it appears the market leader in RKLB‚Äôs industry is currently valued at about 23x 2023 revenue or 15x projected 2024 revenue. Obviously, SpaceX is a private company that is valued differently than in the public markets, but this multiple seems reasonable for the industry‚Äôs profit margins and growth expectations. I‚Äôm aware that RKLB‚Äôs business lines aren‚Äôt identical to SpaceX‚Äôs, but I believe Wall Street will utilize similar logic when establishing an appropriate multiple for RKLB. However, given SpaceX‚Äôs dominance in the industry and the significant amount of execution risk remaining in RKLB‚Äôs growth trajectory, it would be appropriate to apply a lower multiple to RKLB to account for this risk. At a stock price of $10 or a market cap of about $4.9BB, RKLB is trading at a 20x multiple on 2023 revenue or 12x expected 2024 revenue. From my perspective, this is not a large enough discount compared to SpaceX. I believe that RKLB‚Äôs multiple should be no more than half of SpaceX‚Äôs - 11.5x 2023 revenue or 7.5x projected 2024 revenue. This would equate to a market capitalization of $2.8BB to $3.0BB. This range of market capitalizations would equate to a stock price of $5.50 to $6.00 per share.

**Psychological $10 Barrier**
As previously mentioned, RKLB IPO‚Äôed through a SPAC merger back in 2021 at about $10 per share. After experiencing a large but short-lived pump in the share price, the stock quickly dove down to the $4-$5 range where it stayed for years. Investors that entered a RKLB position at IPO or in the immediate run-up post-IPO are finally seeing an opportunity to exit the shares of a company that has done nothing for them for years as the S&P, Dow and Nasdaq have hit record highs. That being said, I think $10 will be a very difficult barrier to break both for practical and psychological reasons. The vast majority of companies that IPO‚Äôed via a SPAC are still trading below their IPO price today. Increases in the share price above $10 are likely to be short-lived as we saw on September 30th, the first trading day after public confirmation of the successful hot fire tests of the Archimedes engine. 

**Conclusion**
In summation, I believe RKLB‚Äôs share price is experiencing a short term pump above what I‚Äôd consider to be a sustainable market capitalization based on their current and future revenue expectations. I expect the shares to return to $6 range before year end. I do not expect the shares to return to the $4 range. In the spirit of disclosure, I should mention that I previously worked for a private equity company that still holds a substantial stake in RKLB and SpaceX, but I was not directly involved in the private equity arm of the company so I had no special access to their investment theses or MNPI. I do still own approximately $50,000 in equity shares of my previous company. As it relates to more direct RKLB-related investments, I have a number of November 2024 put options with a $7 strike price that I paid approximately $.20 per share for. In the event my investment thesis plays out as I expect, I intend to convert the profits from the put options into an equity stake in RKLB with a holding period of 5+ years.

RKLB_posts.csv,Why I think RKLB is a hold ,"I'm seeing a lot of new people popping up in this sub talking about gainz for ants. Y'all shortsighted motherfuckers. Look at the macro picture: 

1. US/China space race heating up. China is seen as a ""pacing challenge"" by the US military. Last time this shit happened during the Cold War, NASA spending reached 4.5% of federal budget. 

2. NO to monopoly. National security shit is not allowed to have a monopoly. Spacex will never be the only player. And it's valued at 200 bil, almost 50x what rklb is worth.

3. The huge TAM of space services in general. Lunar exploration, mars, LEO sats, spy sats, LEO experimental medicine, low gravity manufacturing etc. A lot of it is speculative you say? Well that's what investing in tech is about aye? You're looking for the NEXT BIG THING, not the last big thing. You might as well do GEICO and Coca Cola if you're of that bent. 

4. Actual working rocket and workable path to another big ass rocket. How many other companies you know put their money where their mouth is and can execute to a high level. Shit, even bezos is fking up with blue origin. I have more confidence in someone who has actually made a rocket fly, than some shit that's still on the pad. 

5. A good underpromise over deliver CEO. Sir Beck doesn't shoot his mouth off. Wanna know what that means? It means if he's anything like Musk, share price would be a multiple of what it is with hype. And I'm all for execute first hype later. 

6. Improving macro environment. Last time we had a massive reduction in rates after 08, there's a boom for 10 years. 2011 to 2021 were some of the best times in the market. Now with lower rates, you bet your ass the rotation into small and mid caps is gonna happen. Not least because lower rates make capital raising and debt obligations a lot more manageable.

RKLB_posts.csv,Why would investing in RKLB be a good idea?,"""investing in technological revolutions is the least successful strategy""

Considering what is said in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZnVt\_CvL3k&ab\_channel=BenFelix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZnVt_CvL3k&ab_channel=BenFelix)

What are your counter arguments in support to holding RKLB long term (well beyond Neturon & profitability milestones)?

RKLB has high variance in possible outcomes in terms of return, hence by Jensen's inequality it must be overpriced currently.

RKLB is clearly in technological revolution category and while it may rise a lot in the near future, once it integrates into the economy and shifts from idiosyncratic to system risk, it may all deflate in the end.

RKLB_posts.csv,Cash and equivalents after reaching $8.04,"Thanks to u/wfriedma for the reminder, that with the price over $8.04, the capped calls Rocket Lab purchased a while ago should now be relevant again.

This is all from memory, and from my understanding of things, so take it with a grain of salt, but I think the current share price should now mean that Rocket Lab has about $700 million in cash and equivalents (rather than the ~$500 million they had at the end of Q2).

This is because the convertible notes that Rocket Lab issued were for about 69 million shares with a conversion price of $5.13. So that was to raise about $350 million dollars, that they will eventually have to settle either with cash or the 69 million shares (or some combination of the two).

To try to reduce the possibility of the full amount of dilution needing to happen to settle/redeem the notes, Rocket Lab also bought call options capped at $8.04.

The idea with those call options was that they would allow Rocket Lab to settle the convertible notes entirely with cash, without needing to pay more than the original ~$350 million principal amount, and without needing to issue any shares, up to the point of the share price being $8.04. Any higher than that and they'd need to either issue shares as well to completely settle the notes, or pay more cash beyond the original ~$350 million plus the proceeds from the call options.

In other words, the point of the capped calls was to allow Rocket Lab to pay back ""for free"" to the holders of the notes the difference between $5.13 and $8.04 per share for ~69 million shares (obviously not actually for free, the capped calls cost something like $50 million), if the share price happened to be at $8.04 when the notes were due.

So by my understanding, that works out to a maximum of about $200 million in proceeds from the capped calls, which should have been available to Rocket Lab as soon as the share price was above $8.04, i.e. today.

Saying that ~$200 million will now be added to their balance sheet is not taking into account whatever value the calls had on their balance sheet at the end of Q2 though, so I would expect my $200 million number here could be a bit too high, but it should be in the ballpark.

But the main point is, Rocket Lab should be in a significantly better cash position now, because of this latest surge in the share price.",30,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fpih3t/cash_and_equivalents_after_reaching_804/,0.9965,0.156,0.844,0.0

RKLB_posts.csv,Anyone here holding LUNR and RDW aswell as RKLB?,"I‚Äôve finally pulled the trigger and put some money in the space stocks, and I‚Äôve gone for RKLB, LUNR and RDW, with RKLB being the biggest holding of the 3.

My train of thought was, the more these companies grow and develop, get more cash behind them, capture more share of the growing space market etc, that these 3 combined will be absolutely raking the contracts in. RKLB for launch and end to end space services, Redwire for development and construction of higher end speciality space tech (their space 3d printing will be a huge bread winner imo, and then all their general high quality infrastructure like their solar cells, robotic arms, cameras, sensors, RF transmitters, in space manufacturing, their space greenhouses etc), and LUNR could/will be the go to company for getting your things on to the moon surface which is essential and they‚Äôre one of the only ones offering actual payload delivery to the moon surface (can‚Äôt see many commercial avenues for this currently but now space is more accessible than ever, I predict that america will want to have some amount of control over the moon surface, before China gets there first, I‚Äôd imagine establishing moon dominance will become a bit of a strategic/geopolitical thing)

Obviously this is all wildly speculative and a very, very high risk play. But in the long run (im thinking 15 years +), if these 3 are still around by that point, they‚Äôll be space giants and there‚Äôll always be one of the three receiving a contract for something. Obviously spacex will be hoovering up contracts too, but I still think that in the long term, these 3 will be consistentently winning more and more contracts and are probably positioned to be giants in the market when it inevitably consolidates.

3 Millionaire-Maker Space Stocks

Historically, space exploration and putting satellites into orbit has been within the purview of government-funded agencies like NASA.

That's changing, though. For-profit corporations can handle this work at least as cost-effectively as government-run organizations can. Elon Musk's SpaceX recently facilitated the world's first-ever private citizen spacewalk, for example, while Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is mainstreaming space tourism. Blue Origin's newest rocket will even soon be launching two Mars probes for NASA.

This is only the beginning of privatized work in outer space, now that technology not only allows for it, but necessitates it. Market research outfits Polaris and Precedence agree that launch services alone will be roughly a $50 billion-per-year business within a decade. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley and Citi both predict that the entirety of the science, technology, and services businesses linked to space will be worth on the order of $1 trillion by 2040.

Connect the dots. There's real investment opportunity here.

The top opportunities, however, aren't likely to be the obvious names. The potential millionaire-making space stocks are likely to be the lower-profile stocks that could even be considered a little off the radar. Here's a closer look at three of your better bets among such prospects.



Rocket Lab USA

It may not be a household name, but Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ: RKLB) has been very busy for quite some time now. Since its very first launch in May 2017, this company has put over 190 satellites into orbit. Its technology (like software, solar panels, radios, etc.) is also found inside more than 1,700 different satellites, as well as the James Webb Space Telescope. The two aforementioned Mars probes will also be flying with Rocket Lab tech on board.

While there's a clear market for satellite launches, Rocket Lab's been at it for a while. For any ticker to offer real millionaire-making potential, the company must mostly be undiscovered. That, or it needs to be doing something new that most investors don't yet fully appreciate. In this case it's the latter.

To date, all of this company's launches have utilized its so-called Electron rocket. It's perfectly fine for putting small satellites into orbit, but it's not powerful enough to lift larger satellites, exploration craft, or people into space.

That's coming, though. The Neutron rocket expected to start flying next year will be a so-called medium-lift vehicle capable of carrying bigger machinery. In fact, it will even be able to provide the initial liftoff for missions to Mars and Venus. The Neutron rocket will also be reusable, making it cost-effective for the company as well as its customers. Perhaps most important, the soon-to-launch Neutron rocket will provide real competition to SpaceX, which currently dominates the medium-lift market.

And interest is definitely firming up even before its first commercial flight. The U.S. Space Force has already provided funding to co-develop an upper stage of Rocket Lab's Neutron rocket as part of the Department of Defense's efforts to ensure it's able to secure and defend the United States wherever and however it needs to.



AST SpaceMobile

AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ: ASTS) isn't nearly as far along as Rocket Lab USA is on the commercialization front. In fact, the company only recently launched its first-ever commercial satellites. These certainly won't be the last, however, now that the underlying technology has been proven and perfected.

It's not an apples-to-apples comparison. Whereas Rocket Lab designs tech for others' satellites as well as a means of putting them into orbit, as the name implies, AST SpaceMobile offers mobile broadband connectivity via satellites rather than cellphone towers. This tech is capable of connecting anyone to the worldwide web regardless of where they are -- no physical infrastructure (other than a functioning, web-capable phone) required.

At first blush, it seems like a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. You likely don't have any trouble connecting to the web, whether that be with your phone or a computer. That's not necessarily the norm, however, and that line of thinking underestimates a growing challenge.

See, as the world becomes increasingly connected -- including our cars -- our telecom infrastructure is being pushed to its limits. Much of the developed world is now running low on radio frequencies to assign to mobile phones and cell towers. Offloading this data traffic to fiberoptic connections has certainly helped, but handling such constant switchovers en masse can be technically complex as well, and still won't fully meet future needs.

There's also the not-so-small matter that such connectivity frameworks are vulnerable to power outages and other sorts of disruption.

Satellite-based connectivity, however, sidesteps many of those problems. It's not exactly a new idea, either. Even if not always practical or affordable for the average consumer, satellite-driven mobile phone connectivity has been around since the 90s.

Now that it's practical as well as affordable, Polaris Market Research believes this market is poised to grow at an average annual pace of 18% through 2032. AST SpaceMobile is smack-dab in the middle of this mainstreaming movement.


Intuitive Machines

Last but not least, add Intuitive Machines (NASDAQ: LUNR) to your list of space-related stocks that could turn out to be millionaire makers.

In some ways, Intuitive Machines is the riskiest of the three stocks in question simply due to its small size and young age. Its market capitalization is a mere $375 million, and while it's now producing annual revenue in the same ballpark following its founding in 2013, it's also still operating in the red with only a little over $30 million worth of cash in the bank.

In other ways, though, Intuitive Machines is arguably the least risky of these three stocks just because it's also operating the most practical, currently marketable business. Simply put, this company is helping for-profit organizations and government agencies get back to the Moon. Whether that's drones that land on the Moon to map it or a means of putting communication satellites in a lunar orbit, Intuitive Machines has a solution.

It's prescient, too, given that the Moon has moved back into focus as the world's next space-exploration point of interest, perhaps as a place to mine or colonize, or perhaps as a test run for a manned mission to Mars.

Indeed, NASA's Artemis rocket designed specifically to return mankind to the Moon is still slated to do so sometime in the latter part of 2025 or 2026. This voyage will partially be made possible with the help Intuitive Machines has already provided and will provide in the future. The company recently announced a $117 million contract to deliver six different payloads to the Moon for NASA.

This is still just the beginning. Analysts believe growing interest in Moon trips will drive enough revenue growth for Intuitive Machines to push it out of the red and into the black by 2026. Reaching that milestone could easily send this stock on a rocket ride, so to speak.

Now that's obviously optimistic but given that New Shepherd has been successful (suborbital), it seems likely that Blue has the ability to reach orbit successfully. Whether it's 2025 or 2026, at some point pretty soon they'll be launching NG at decent cadence. Different from Stoke or Relativity which are doing interesting things but hasn't proven to to be able to go orbital which is as hard as making an engine (or harder). Most of these launches will be for Kuiper now and going forward so there's plenty of business left for Neutron. I'm not worried about that.

RKLB_posts.csv,Question,"I live in Korea and in Korean sites, a number of people are concerned about RKLB because Trump said he will appoint Elon as ‚Äògovernment efficiency commission‚Äô if he becomes president.

Basically, they are worried because according to them(Koreans) Peter allegedly said that Elon is trying to suppress competitors like Rocket Lab in this field and that he is interfering w RKLB‚Äôs foothold in the industry by doing things such as lowering the launch price of the small-mounted vehicles etc.

As a result, Koreans w RKLB stocks are concerned about Trump being president since if Elon Musk takes up the government position, there is a very high possibility that he will use legal methods to push Spacex and suppress the competitions like Rocket Lab (according to them).

I want to ask if this is substantiated or just over-speculation/conspiracy by Koreans since I haven‚Äôt seen people in this Sub talk about this(or maybe you guys did and I didn‚Äôt see it).

RKLB_posts.csv,The Intangibles are important - and its looking better for Rocket Lab,"I kinda feel sorry for SpaceX lately.  They have done some fantastic engineering and I‚Äôm sure have a lot of great people but their CEO and 50% owner has become a huge distraction.  The new private space race is in its infancy so a good head start isn‚Äôt enough.  Maintaining superiority in an industry over decades is difficult.  Do you know how many auto manufactures didn‚Äôt make it?  If you want to see what negative publicity can do to a superior product, go read the story of Preston Tucker or watch the movie.  

If Musk had just kept the problem to X, it would probably be fine but now he is using Starlink to defy the Brazilian Government.  I know that their government involved Starlink first but instead of backing down he is doubling down.  This could have long term ramifications if worldwide governments think Musk has no respect for their laws and start to put laws in place to limit his power in their countries.  I can guarantee these discussions are happening.  

The other problem for SpaceX now is their CEO decided to bet on one horse instead of just remaining neutral.  If his horse loses, there is no way he will see support from a Harris/Walz administration.  Musk is posting pictures of Harris as a Russian General‚Ä¶such a dumb move if you really want government contracts. I‚Äôm sure there are people in SpaceX that have left or are thinking of leaving because they don‚Äôt want to work for Musk anymore.  Again‚Ä¶.that will benefit Rocket lab and Blue Origin and maybe a few of the other startups looking to scale quickly.

Blue Origin and Rocket Lab are poised to take advantage of these missteps by Musk.

I think they are making and developing chips for satellite operation / control and other various space craft in future))

Regardless of the semis / chips, the other aspects of the company are all notably exceptional. There are 4 ish various space craft at the moment (see video where Beck introduces the new names, it is funny)

RKLB_posts.csv,Rocket Lab Owns 2/3 of the U.S. Launch Market -- That Isn't SpaceX,"https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/rocket-lab-owns-2-3-120000860.html

When Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB) reported second-quarter earnings last week, it ignited a multiday rally that sent its stock price soaring as much as 18%. And no wonder.

Sales at the small space rocket manufacturer soared 71% year over year, beating analyst forecasts. The per-share loss for the quarter was $0.08 -- not great -- but still better than the $0.10 loss that Wall Street forecast.

A historic quarter

In fact, Chief Executive Officer Peter Beck said Q2 was Rocket Lab's ""highest revenue quarter in company history"" -- no great surprise given that each succeeding quarter shows revenue growth. But Beck also said that Rocket Lab is seeing ""strong and growing demand for our launch services and space systems products,"" such as the Electron rocket, Photon kick stage spacecraft, and satellites built for the U.S. Space Force. The company is also making progress on new products to power profit in the future.

First and foremost among these are the new Neutron rocket, a medium-lift rocket that, in a unique twist on traditional design, encapsulates its second stage within a reusable first stage with an integrated (and also reusable) payload fairing.

In last week's press release, Rocket Lab highlighted the recent successful first hot fire test of the Archimedes engine, nine of which will be used to power Neutron's first stage. Four days later, Rocket Lab posted a ""how it started, how it's going"" photo comparison on X first showing CEO Beck standing next to a mockup of the then-just-announced Neutron concept vehicle, side by side with a completed half-fairing for a real-life Neutron rocket.

What's more, just one day earlier, Rocket Lab announced its 10th mission so far this year, the launch of a Capella Space satellite to orbit atop an Electron rocket. Crucially, this was the first launch for Capella since September 2023, when an anomaly in an Electron rocket's second stage resulted in a loss of the payload. The fact that Capella maintained its faith in Rocket Lab -- and that faith was vindicated with a successful launch over the weekend -- has to come as happy news for Rocket Lab shareholders.

SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and ULA -- in that order

So yes, it's been a busy few days for Rocket Lab, and jam-packed with good news. Now here's some less good news.

According to Beck, Rocket Lab's Electron has become ""the most frequently launched small rocket globally."" And so far this year, Rocket Lab is responsible for ""64% of all non-SpaceX orbital U.S. launches in 2024 to date."" That sounds impressive, but it comes with a big caveat. SpaceX orbital U.S. launches already number 79 (and probably more by the time this article publishes). Meanwhile, Rocket Lab's 64% amounts to only 10 launches total.

That actually gives you a better idea of the distance between No. 2 rocket launcher Rocket Lab and No. 3 United Launch Alliance (ULA has launched four times this year, making up about 28% of non-SpaceX orbital U.S. launches), than of how close Rocket Lab is to overtaking SpaceX.

Hint: It's not even close. For the foreseeable future, the great American space race is going to remain with SpaceX as No. 1, then a big gap with everybody else.

The race for No. 2

Investors also need to be aware that Rocket Lab faces some serious competition even in the race to remain No. 2 to SpaceX.

Don't get me wrong. Rocket Lab is accelerating its launch cadence. Its revenue is accelerating. And there's a very real chance Rocket Lab will turn profitable in the next year or two. Still, now that United Launch Alliance has its new Vulcan rocket operational, it's moving quickly to regain its traditional role as one of America's leading launch companies. As I pointed out earlier this month, ULA currently has 23 Vulcan rockets in various stages of construction, and ULA CEO Tory Bruno is promising investors he will launch 20 times next year, and 25 times in 2026.

With 10 launches under its belt already in 2024, and more on the way, Rocket Lab could still out-launch ULA, and remain America's No. 2 launch provider in the future. But ULA is definitely going to try and give Rocket Lab a run for its money.",155,13,https://i.redd.it/h1c1fwpaemkd1.jpeg,0.9969,0.137,0.803,0.06

RKLB_posts.csv,FAQ for RKLB For new WSB people (fixed) thanks chatGPT,"**What do they sell?**  
Rockets, satellites, hardware, and software.

**How were they listed?**  
SPAC. They had a peak at $18.

**Who is the CEO?**  
Sir Peter Beck.

**Wait, the CEO is knighted?**  
Yes, he's a New Zealander.

**Wait, the CEO of a significant aerospace company is a New Zealander?**  
Yeah, that's why it's unusual. It shows his intelligence in achieving something no one expected.

**Who are their competitors?**  
SpaceX, Blue Origin, Firefly, Stoke, and technically Astra.

**Wait, I only know two of those.**  
Two have never launched, and two haven't launched for ages.

**Wait, didn't one of those companies also get listed and then delisted?**  
Astra did that, and Virgin Orbit too, until they filed for Chapter 11.

**Ok, cool. What are Rocket Lab's competitive advantages over SpaceX and Blue Origin?**  
With Electron, smaller satellites that need to be launched sooner and to closer locations can be cheaper and more profitable over time compared to delays.

**Wait, why does their revenue recognition change so often over quarters?**  
Revenue for launches can only be recognized at launch, with 90% paid by launch day.

**How many launches are needed on Electron per year to be profitable?**  
Around 21.

**Wait, they didn‚Äôt launch that many per year.**  
First, consider revenue recognition. Delays are primarily on the client side.

**What is Neutron?**  
A significant new rocket that can lift up to 13 metric tons.

**How much does R&D for this cost?**  
It's supposed to be around $300 million. It might cost more.

**Wait, that‚Äôs a lot.**  
Yes, but relatively speaking, it's cheap. The Falcon 9 cost around $390 million in 2011.

**When will it launch?**  
Mid next year.

**How far along are they in development?**  
They've tested the engine.

**What about their other business activities?**  
Are they doing recovery?  
Soon.

**I‚Äôm glad you asked about satellites and space systems. These are high-revenue lines, profiting under SolAero and Sinclair, and selling carbon composites.**

**What do those do?**  
Star trackers, ion propulsion, solar panels, separation systems, and solar panels.

**How did they acquire these companies?**  
M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions).

**Wait, that‚Äôs like shopping for companies?**  
Yes, it's hinted that they may buy something for a new constellation.

**Who are their customers?**  
NASA, DOD, Space Force, and commercial customers.

**Wait, the financial statements say they‚Äôve got convertible notes.**  
Yes, they have debt that can become shares.

**Great, are there any cons?**  
Yes.

**What are they?**  
Risk of a launch failure, delays in Neutron, and onerous legislation.

RKLB_posts.csv,What many people miss about Rocket Lab,"I have seen a lot of posts on here and WSB that only discuss the launch side of Rocket Lab.

Rocket Lab is not just a launch company. They are way more than that. They are an end to end space company.

Take a look at these scenarios below.

Company X( basically all companies that need something in space to operate. Use ASTS for example): These companies design and build something that operates in space, but rely on another company to get their equipment there.

SpaceX: launch provider with an emphasis on launching their own constellation with further goals in space. We all know they can launch themselves.

Rocket Lab: started as a launch only company with Electron but have heavily diversified their business into space systems. Their business offers the ability to design, build, launch and operate a customers satellites or space craft or maybe their own constellation someday. This is why it is called end to end. Their business is not launch, launch is only one of their tools to more effectively do business in space. Neutron will not make or break this company. They do not rely in its success to make them profitable. They could stop development today and still be profitable in the future due to the way they have positioned themselves in the industry through their space system business segments. This type of position is going to be huge in the future as more people move their business into space.

I have followed this company for 3 years and they continue to impress me. Though launch is a very exciting part of this business, since it is really the only one we can see, I encourage every investor here to start viewing this company as an all around space company instead of just a launch company.

RKLB_posts.csv,Rocket Lab Acquisition / Constellation Analysis,"# Hey r/RKLB, just wanted to share some analysis I've been doing on potential acquisition targets.

Rocket Lab's track record with acquisitions follows a fairly well-defined pattern. Let's take a look at the companies they have purchased thus far:

* **SolAero Technologies** - $80m - Dec '21 - Provider of high performance solar panels - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-space-solar-power-products-company-solaero-holdings-inc/)
* **Planetary System Corp (PSC)** - $42m + 1.7m shares - Dec '21 - Provider of separation systems - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-space-hardware-company-planetary-systems-corporation/)
* **Advanced Solutions Inc (ASI)** - $40m - Oct '21 - Flight software, mission sim, and guidance + nav software - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-acquires-space-software-company-advanced-solutions-inc/)
* **Sinclair Interplanetary** - $ Unknown - Apr - '20 - Satellite components (reaction wheels, star trackers, etc) - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-satellite-hardware-manufacturer-sinclair-interplanetary/)

Here is a section of an interview with CEO Peter Beck explaining the methodology behind Rocket Lab's acquisitions: [https://youtu.be/T\_\_1ubfs\_iE?t=1313](https://youtu.be/T__1ubfs_iE?t=1313)

* ""If the supply chain can not provide us the surety to deliver what we need, then we‚Äôll go and vertically integrate""
* ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs too expensive and it‚Äôs too slow, generally we need to own it because we can make it cheaper and faster‚Äù
* ""Is this going to be strategically important to us in the future for stuff that we think we're going to do""

To summarize, Rocket Lab's acquisitions have all been vertical integration plays; bringing some aspect of their supply chain in house to either reduce lead times, unit cost, or both. Peter has mentioned in multiple interviews that all of these companies have scaled and integrated successfully into Rocket Lab's business.

Note how most of these acquisitions support the production and manufacturing of satellite **buses**. A quick review: satellites can be described as being comprised of a **bus** and a **payload.**

**Bus** - the main structure and infrastructure of a satellite, providing the necessary support systems for the payload to operate effectively. It includes power, structure, solar panels, propulsion, thermal control, attitude control, communication, and on-board computer systems.

**Payload** - the primary instrumentation or equipment on a satellite that performs the specific mission or function, such as sensing, communication, or experimentation, and is the reason the satellite is launched into space.  
  

Rocket Lab can currently produce satellite buses quickly, cost effectively, and at scale. Payloads? Not so much. 

# I think Rocket Lab's next acquisition will be a payload company. A company that specializes communications equipment, imaging/sensors, etc.

It's been clearly communicated by leadership that Rocket Lab plans on building a LEO constellation. If/when they do announce an acquisition of a payload company, we will be able to make some pretty big assumptions about the type of constellation they will build.

I do not think Rocket Lab will build out a direct to consumer mega constellation a la Starlink or Kuiper based on the following:

* Starlink's original estimated cost to design, build and deploy was $10 Billion  [source](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/05/block-5-spacex-increase-launch-cadence-lower-prices/)
* Amazon reportedly invested $10 Billion in the Kuiper project in 2020 [source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/fcc-authorizes-amazon-to-build-kuiper-satellite-internet-network.html)
* Comments from CFO Adam Spice :

>""the broadband from space application that SpaceX targeted with Starlink, that's probably not what we will be going for just given the amount of capital required"" [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=1059)

>""but there's lots of very interesting applications that required dozens or hundreds of satellites not 40 thousand satellites"" [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=1070)

While it's possible they could pursue a smaller 5G constellation similar to AST SpaceMobile, I think AST's tech moat is wide enough that other opportunities make more sense.

# I think it's likely that we see a smaller 100-200 satellite constellation purpose built and marketed towards military applications.

These satellites could provide access to a suite of sensors, communication systems, radar, antennas, etc., and deliver tailored services to DoD customers. A few points supporting that:

* Rocket Lab is prime DoD contractor as of Dec '23, acting as prime for the $515m SDA Tranche 2 Transport Layer - Beta contract. According to Adam Spice this:

>""opens up a lot of opportunities for us"" .. ""we think it's a huge enabler to grow that government exposure"".  [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=515)

* Sitting Board member Nina Armagno, among many other things, **was the first director of staff of the United States Space Force** and was responsible for helping to establish the organizational framework, policies and procedures, building relationships with other branches, etc.  [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/about/team/)
* The business is already heavily focused on gov customers. SDA, ESCAPADE, HASTE, CAPSTONE, TROPICS, etc, all make up a huge chunk of rocket lab's revenue already.

# Ok. So if it's likely that the acquisition is a payload company, and it's likely that the payload would be for a constellation built for servicing DoD customers, I think I know where to look...

# [Here is a list of subcontractors that Rocket Lab selected to help fulfill the SDA contract](https://spaceimpulse.com/2024/05/07/rocket-lab-selects-subcontractors-for-sda-satellite-constellation/#:~:text=The%20selected%20subcontractors%20include%20CesiumAstro,Redwire%20Space%2C%20and%20Parsons%20Corporation)

What do you know, a bunch of **payload** companies (mostly).

* **CesiumAstro** - $260-390m [source](https://app.dealroom.co/companies/cesiumastro) - will provide its Vireo active electronically scanned array (AESA) radio frequency (RF) communications payload, known as the first multi-beam-capable Ka-band communications system for SDA‚Äôs PWSA.
* **Mynaric** - $93m Mkt Cap - will supply CONDOR Mk3 optical communication terminals, enhancing free space optical communications for air, space, and mobile applications.
* **Redwire Space** - 450m Mkt Cap - has been chosen for its expertise in antennas and RF hardware.
* **Parsons Corp** - 10b Mkt Cap - will provide the NEBULA Operations ‚Äì Vendor Architecture (NOVA), serving as Rocket Lab‚Äôs ground system for the operational management of its 18 satellites.
* **SEAKR Engineering** - Acquired by Raytheon - will offer its Tactical Satellite Communications (TACSATCOM) Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Network Encryption System (NES).
* **Collins Aerospace** - Acquired by Safran Group - ¬†is set to deliver the waveform necessary for the SDR, essential software and firmware for TACSATCOM‚Äôs transmission and reception.

# Cash Situation

Rocket Lab's current Cash and Equivalents and marketable securities etc is $546.8m ([source - slide 37](https://s28.q4cdn.com/737637457/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/FINAL-Rocket-Lab-Q2-2024-Earnings-Presentation.pdf))

All the previous acquisitions have been in the $40-80m range (Sinclair likely less)

Adam Spice gave guidance in the Q2 '24 earnings call that capex for Neutron R&D was expected to tick up in the in the second half of 2024 [source](https://youtu.be/lE9SPN_bIhc?t=3634)

Adam Spice on whether they would do another cap raise - ""Right now we don't see anything that would cause us to go back to capital markets"" but did provide a caveat that for the right opportunity, it's a possibility [source](https://youtu.be/lE9SPN_bIhc?t=5751)

So it's not likely they would raise capital for an acquisition, but it's also not off the table.

Obviously the last three subcontractors on the list aren't an option, and $450m for Redwire seems a bit steep given the cash on hand. **Mynaric** and **CesiumAstro** both fit the profile and around the price range we are looking for.

Do I think one of these companies will be acquired by Rocket Lab? **I don't know**.

Do I think a company *like* Mynaric or CesiumAstro will be acquired by Rocket Lab? **Yes.**

Here's a few predictions:

* I think the first constellation Rocket Lab builds will be less than 200 satellites
* I think it will be purpose built to serve the DoD, possibly partnering with a branch to actually fund the first tranche of satellites
* If there is an acquisition, I feel very confident that it will be a payload company
* Without a cap raise, I think $100m is the most we could afford to spend on an acquisition (assuming no Neutron delays etc)

# TL;DR I don't know if/who they will acquire but wrote this as a framework to (hopefully) start a discussion anchored around the type and size company I think fits the bill.",101,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1evtjur/rocket_lab_acquisition_constellation_analysis/,0.9984,0.091,0.907,0.002

RKLB_posts.csv,Everyday Astronaut video about New Glenn,"This post is actually about Rocket Lab & Neutron, not a Blue Origin advertisement.

I really highly recommend watching Everyday Astronaut‚Äôs latest YouTube video with Jeff Bezos & New Glenn Factory. It confirmed three things I‚Äôve personally thought are Rocket Labs clear advantages with Neutron.

1. Carbon composite gives you best performance and is clearly the best material choice. Downside to this is iterating the rocket design is not realistic so you have to get it right with the first design. Rocket Lab already did exactly this with Electron.

2. Reusable fairings attached to the 1st stage are an excellent idea to reduce cost.

3. If you can make the 2nd stage cheap enough, you will never have to deal with the problems that a reusable 2nd stage will have. Blue Origin is also attempting this. They‚Äôre (in parallel) designing a reusable 2nd stage and another ‚Äùas cheap as possible‚Äù expendable 2nd stage. Bezos said if they can make the expendable 2nd stage very cheap, then it doesn‚Äôt make economical sense to attempt to reuse it. 

What are these 2nd stage problems I mentioned? Look at what Starship has to deal with on re-entry. Combine that with the extra weight of the stainless steel, fuel, heat shielding that is required to make it reusable. That‚Äôs weight that could be used to deliver extra payload to orbit. (I know I know, Starship is designed for interplanetary travel etc. so re-entry is a requirement)

Rocket Lab is purely going for a 2nd stage that is as cheap and as light as possible. I think this will prove to be the right choice. There‚Äôs a lot of reasons why and are mostly related to economics and performance of the overall vehicle.

For example the empty weight for the 2nd stage of a Falcon 9 is 3900kg. Peter Beck has stated the 2nd stage of Neutron is roughly the same weight as a Harley Davidson motorcycle so around 300-400kg. That‚Äôs a big difference.

After watching the video I have a lot more respect for Jeff Bezos & Blue Origin. On a related note, Blue Origin is scheduled to launch two spacecraft built by Rocket Lab to Mars next month (unless there‚Äôs a delay)",49,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1eufya5/everyday_astronaut_video_about_new_glenn/,0.9506,0.07,0.899,0.031

RKLB_posts.csv,Simple DD for Newcomers.,"RKLB builds satellites and rockets currently it has operational Electron small launch rocket with over 50 launches. They are working on a big rocket called Neutron which will be Reusable. As well as a suite of various satellites.

What is a reusable rocket and why is it important?

Most rockets ever to exist have been expendable, meaning they get destroyed or become museum peices. Imagine the cost of an airplane ticket if you had to build a 747 airplane fly across the world and trash the 747 every time. That's basically what humanity did until SpaceX proved it was possible to land rockets with Falcon 9. The concept has been proven. Rocket Lab along with a few others are chasing this dream. Since SpaceX landed Falcon 9 and became reusable no one has been able to duplicate this and the company is now worth 210 billion market cap, they are in first place a huge leap ahead of everyone.

Furthermore, Rocket Lab builds the satellites for many of the launches, satellite components and has a huge space systems division and sells a service, which means they scoop up way more profit margin. They are far ahead all others (excluding SpaceX) and plan to launch the first Neutron mid 2025 and will become profitable shortly after. 

Neutron will be designed to be reusable from day 1 where Falcon 9 was not which will give them a big advantage in design. 

RKLB is only valued around 3.2 billion to SpaceXs 210 billion. Pennies on the dollar and most agree it is wildly undervalued right now. 

So, proof of concept has been established by SpaceX, Rocket Lab has tons of space and launch experience with their Electron Rocket being the second most frequently launched rocket. They have hundreds of millions in cash reserves to finish the development, the Archimedes engine that powers Neutron has just fired up for the first time recently after 3 yesrs of hard work and engines are the longest lead time in building a rocket. No other company is in a more perfect position to become and remain the #2 space company in the world. Once Neutron is successful and launching, this company should easily be worth 20-50 billion dollars ($45-$100 stock price) fair value still a fraction of SpaceX, they will be able to launch their own mega satellite constellations.

The CEO and Founder Peter Beck is an absolute genius, self taught rocket scientist and has been regarded as such by many influential people in the industry.

RKLB_posts.csv,Will RKLB's share price double this year? - Re-revisiting my post from 2024/04/29,"Today, on 2024/08/16, RKLB reached $7.10, more than doubling from its YTD low of $3.47 on 2024/04/16. Hell yeah!

  
[My old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cfjtco/will_rklbs_share_price_double_this_year/)¬†from 2024/04/29 follows below:

RKLB share price has a history of doubling from its low during the summer and then falling down to repeat the process next year. So far, it has happened every and each year since its listing on the stock market:

* **2021: $9.5 to $21.34 from 2021/08/27 to 2021/09/09**
* **2022: $3.53 to $7.15 from 2022/06/30 to 2022/08/12**
* **2023:**¬†**$3.76 to $8.05 from 2023/05/09 to 2023/07/19**

The 2024 low has been reached on 2024/4/16 at $3.47. What has changed from previous years besides the company's increased performance is that¬†**the reported short interest YTD has increased by 161% from 22m to 58m shorted shares**. This huge increase right before the summer may cause a bound of a violent volatility once the 2024 doubling commences.

RKLB trades so cheaply and it is so heavily shorted that all that may be needed to revalue its stock is a shift in sentiment. Right now the stock is pricing in the most bearish of bearish outcomes. Delayed Neutron development, increased R&D costs and Electron's obsolescence. But Rocket Lab is the only space company dedicated to being a one stop shop for space applications. Suppose over this year, the management can craft a narrative that Neutron is really coming this year/early next year and with it a significant decrease in R&D costs and the growth and capture of launch and space system markets. Such sentiment shift may take time but I don't know, there are so many unusual factors with Rocket Lab that I could see it happening rapidly.

I am not betting that Rocket Lab is going to stage the most epic growth of all time. I am just betting on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06).
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year.

RKLB_posts.csv,Peter Beck and Rocket Lab have an opportunity‚Ä¶and seem to be playing it right.,"This isn‚Äôt to get too political‚Ä¶it‚Äôs about business but also how politics plays an important role in the success of space focused companies.  Everyone here knows that Space X is the current leader in the industry.  They have a solid infrastructure, some good engineers, and have done a great job so far.  They got an early lead and were well on their way to being the leader for decades to come.  Something similar could be said for Tesla.  However, in the early stages in a new industry, big mistakes can be extremely costly.  In the case of Tesla, the focus on the cybertruck and electric semi‚Äôs has cost a fair amount of Cap ex and no revenue.  Cybertrucks are sitting on lots and in fields and if you follow the Reddit r/cyberstuck you can see that they are basically hot garbage.  Teslas were incredibly successful at first but the constant price decreases and increases have turned some people off from buying again.  On top of that, and more importantly, Musk himself has alienated his largest consumer base with his anti-California, anti-lgbtq, etc‚Ä¶nonsense.  If there is one thing most successful CEOs will say is keep your loyal customers happy.  Tesla‚Äôs share of EV sales has dropped from 75% in 2022 to just under 50% in 2024.  

But, this is about Rocket Lab.  Space companies are going to continue to rely on government contracts along with the private sector.  For U.S. contracts, the company has to be based in the U.S. and meet specific security requirements.  There are only a couple of companies that can do that.  Over the next decade, the space industry should see phenomenal growth.  One company will not provide all the services.  The contracts will be split between multiple companies.  When it comes time to award those contracts, ability and consistency will play a huge role and also reputation.  Beck has done a fantastic job of being politically neutral.  He just gets the job done.  Musk on the other hand has decided to back one horse whole-heartedly and there will be a price to pay for that.  If his candidate loses, along with the trepidation congress already feels about how much power and influence he already has, it could be an opportunity for Rocket Lab to grow with huge contracts.  They just have to get Neutron to be successful.  If Kuniper turns out to have better technology then Starlink and if ASTS technology takes market share since a lot of people just want their phone to work in remote areas and not carry around an entire dish, then that could slow Starlink growth.  Space X will continue to be successful due to Starship but they are not guaranteed the top spot forever now.

Rocket Lab Stock Soars. Space Has Momentum.

Commercial space company Rocket Lab RKLB 12.58% posted stronger quarterly sales Thursday evening, sending shares soaring. Rocket Lab, like Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX, has space launch and satellite-building capabilities. SpaceX, of course, is dominant, launching almost 80 times so far in 2024. Rocket Lab has launched nine times. Investors don‚Äôt get regular quarterly updates from Musk‚Äôs privately held space company. That isn‚Äôt the case with publicly traded Rocket Lab. For the second quarter, Rocket Lab reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, of negative $21 million from sales of just over $106 million. Wall Street was looking for an Ebitda loss of $26 million from sales of just under $106 million. Better cost control, resulting in a smaller-than-expected loss, is a positive. So are higher sales. Rocket Lab‚Äôs second-quarter sales grew about 15% compared with the first quarter and more than 70% year over year. The results sent Rocket Lab shares up about 12.6% in Friday trading to $5.37 apiece. The S&P 500 SPX 0.47% and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA 0.13% gained 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively. Following the report, Stifel analyst Erik Rasmussen wrote that launch demand remains strong and that sales should jump higher in the fourth quarter following relatively flat third-quarter sales of between $100 and $105 million. Rasmussen projects $121 million in fourth-quarter sales, up more than 100% year over year. He projects 2025 sales of about $576 million, up 36% from expected 2024 sales. Rasmussen projects positive Ebitda for the company in 2026, after sales hit almost $1 billion. He rates Rocket Lab shares Buy and has a $9 price target for the stock. Through Friday trading, Rocket Lab shares were down about 4% year to date.Shares of space start-up Virgin Galactic SPCE 2.16% are down about 87% this year, despite a 14% jump on Thursday. The company reported second-quarter sales of $4.2 million on Wednesday evening. Wall Street was looking for $3.4 million. Galactic focuses, of course, on space tourism. While better-than-expected sales are positive, ramping up capacity has been harder than the company expected. Rocket Lab has had more success providing launch services for companies looking to deploy small satellites into low-earth orbit. Coming into Friday trading, Galactic‚Äôs market capitalization was below $200 million. Rocket Lab‚Äôs was north of $2.3 billion. SpaceX dwarfs them both. It‚Äôs valued at some $200 billion in private markets.

_____________________________________________________

Rocket Lab had another successful launch this morning.   Just watched them successfully deploy the Capella satellite.  I think we see $10 by the end of the year.  I also think there might be more consolidation in the space industry.  Everyone knows that to compete with Musk you have to grow as fast as possible.  I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see more U.S. government contracts announced for Rocket Lab.  Boeing has really dropped the ball with leaving the astronauts stuck in space.  They are not getting any contracts until they bring them home unless one of their paid servants in congress really pushes for more money for Boeing.  If two of the big companies don‚Äôt combine in the next 12 months I‚Äôll be surprised.  ",98,48,https://i.redd.it/rgqb4oh2o1id1.jpeg,0.9891,0.099,0.87,0.032

https://open.spotify.com/episode/3IpviNvEIcPEIQr6mrFIoB?si=IDhsKoiHR8mzJ0HN1i7r_Q

Given Stoke are aiming to be a launch only company at this point, I don't think the threat from these guys is too much at this point in time, although Andy did make a comment in the interview that I took as a bit of a sign that they're aiming to progress beyond launch, once they've got launch itself nailed down.

For those who don't know, Stoke are the company aiming to create a fully and rapidly reusable medium lift rocket (on the lower side of medium lift) called Nova. That might sound unlikely for a startup to achieve, but I've got a huge amount of respect for this company and the founders already.

First of all because they just sound like they know what they're doing, but also and probably more importantly because:

- They've already built and started testing a full flow staged combustion cycle engine in just a couple of years since first funding (an insane achievement)
- They've got an actual (and innovative) plan for how to make their second stage reusable, with a novel engine and actively cooled heatshield design
- On top of that they've also been testing development hardware already (doing hop tests) for that second stage

They are privately funded, not a public company to invest in, but I definitely think they're one to keep an eye on, if for no other reason than to keep an eye on as a Rocket Lab competitor (though they seem to be doing an awesome enough job that I'm just interested in seeing what they do anyway).

They aim for first launch at the end of 2025, so around the same time as Neutron.",34,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1ep33m5/manifest_space_interview_with_andy_lapsa_stoke/,0.9885,0.137,0.839,0.024

As far as I'm aware Rocket lab has never posted a quarterly net increase in total current assets **(obviously not counting the capital raise in February).**

Except they did last quarter. This really surprised me, I expected to see a similar quarter over quarter decrease typical to any quarter since the SPAC merger.

Total current assets as well as cash & equivalents + marketable securities combined are slightly higher this quarter than last.

Is this the start of a trend? I'm skeptical for now. CFO Adam Spice mentioned an increase in capex through the next 3-4 quarters tapering off in Q2 '25 as the first neutron launch approaches. That mixed with the lower expected launch revenue in Q3, I wouldn't be too surprised to see the downtrend resume, at least in the near term.

I still found this encouraging and thought it was worth a share.

RKLB_posts.csv,Possible hot fire at NASA Stennis - analysis with NASA firms data.,"Firms (=Fire Information Resource Management System) uses satellites to determine potential wild fire locations. They do that by detecting abnormal heat signatures. It is near real time - about 3 hours delayed.

And the location of a fire at Stennis could not be more precise, it was right at the RocketLabs Stennis test stand. There was a fire detected on the 18th of July. Check out the link below.

RKLB_posts.csv,The SPAC = bad argument...,"Some people argue that all SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) are bad or risky investments.  
  
While they have a point, they're missing the bigger picture. SPACs offer an easy way for companies to access public markets quickly and with less scrutiny. Naturally, this path attracts some questionable companies. However, what these critics overlook is that there are solid companies that have gone public via SPACs because it was a general trend, not because they are shady.

An interesting point to note is that the median return of the entire stock market is negative, with almost every sector, from healthcare to energy, following this trend (with the exception of finance, which has a neutral median return). Only a few stocks contribute to an overall positive average return. (Source: [https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/average-is-not-the-same-as-median](https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/average-is-not-the-same-as-median))

Therefore, SPACs failing or delivering negative returns isn't extraordinary; it's the norm.   
  
Most SPACs are in a worse position than when they went public, often having attempted and failed to launch their projects since their listing. 

However, this isn't the case with RocketLab.   
When RocketLab went public via a SPAC in August 2021, they had already launched 21 times in 4 years, had an annual revenue of $60 million, and their space systems side was just getting started. Now, they launch over 15 times per year, aim for over $400 million in annual revenue, secure constellation-level contracts and $0.5 billion satellite contracts, and we can see their Neutron hardware taking shape.

-> RocketLab is in a significantly better position than when they were listed. The share price does not show it, but the company got fundamentally better.

This is not financial advice, just a few thoughts I had when I saw a graphic about median stock returns.

With 100 reaction wheels per size per decade (Sinclair delivered a total of 360 reaction wheels to orbit before they got the big contract), you do not design and order an injection mold- you just CNC it because its cheaper.  
And you do not built a machine to automatically balance the rotors.

It often rises in bearish markets and falls in bullish markets, as higher IV corresponds to higher expected risk or uncertainty.

**IV Skew:**¬†This shows the difference in IV across different strike prices for option contracts. Different IVs for different strikes reflects the market's expectations of the likelihood of different outcomes.

This skew is showing that the market is *positioning* and *hedging* for a large potential move up OR down within the coming weeks.

To be clear, this is to be taken with a grain of salt, the option chain is just one of many data inputs that investors should consider. But for what its worth, alongside the IV skew, **open interest** and **put/call volume** on the option chain are also quite bullish.

RKLB_posts.csv,How to accelerate Rocket Lab's growth,"Rocket Lab has correctly positioned itself as a vertically-integrated player in the rapidly growing New Space economy. From components to systems, spacecraft, constellations, and through to launch, on-orbit operations, and space-based application solutions, Rocket Lab has built up the capability to ‚Äúdo what it says it‚Äôs going to do.‚Äù More importantly, as it has built up these capabilities, it‚Äôs done so with a success rate that approaches 100%. Rocket Lab does not fail, or at least hasn‚Äôt failed so far. As Beck is heard to say in Wild Wild Space,¬†""I‚Äôm not built to build shit.‚Äù

Yet there are tradeoffs to be made between organic growth and growth gained through acquisitions. Yes, building up capabilities in-house at a place like Rocket Lab ensures that the results meet and often exceed immediate and long-term requirements. Whereas the challenges of an acquisition include cultural fit and other integration challenges as well as inevitable product evolution to meet internal requirements. The biggest expense of internal development is the opportunity cost. Though an acquisition costs actual cash, you‚Äôre buying a capability that‚Äôs closer to market already.

While Rocket Lab has¬†**capabilities**, it has limited¬†**capacity**. The New Space economy is growing so fast that Rocket Lab doesn‚Äôt have enough time to hire the number of top-flight team members needed to grow their business from the inside. But the company‚Äôs anemic market cap makes it nearly impossible to acquire top-flight technologies to keep up with requirements, opportunities, and capacity.

As I see it, there are 4 possible scenarios that will allow the company to optimize growth and fully realize its potential:

1. The market must respond to Rocket Lab‚Äôs potential to such an extent that the market cap grows by multiples.
2. An outside equity investor must be found to invest $1 billion or more to fund¬†acquisitions, but diluting existing investors in the process.
3. Rocket Lab must merge or even be acquired by another company with compatible capabilities/capacity and access to significant capital.
4. Rocket Lab can continue to grow organically with the opportunities and challenges it currently faces.

The market may give greater recognition to Rocket Lab once Neutron reaches orbit. But the stated scale up of launch cadence is incremental, spanning several years before it can deploy a constellation like the Falcon 9 is doing for StarLink. Even with a 70% annual growth rate, it‚Äôll take many years to reach the scale implied by Peter Beck‚Äôs vision.

The earnings call was the main driving force for the share price rocketing up.¬† Shorts were caught napping and they desperately had to scramble to cover their positions which probably drove the share price up even more to the new ATH of >$27. As a result, short interest decreased dramatically (\~20%) from the previous month. Short interest was still high at \~49.28 million shares short or \~13% of the float as of 11/29/2024. I think new shorts have since then opened new short positions (this is how shorts typically react after a massive price spike) and they‚Äôre heavily shorting the stock which is partially causing the downtrend in the share price.¬† The other reason for the downtrend in the share price is probably due to profit taking.¬† My thinking is that we will see share price consolidation in the $20 - 22 range at least in the near term.

My read on this suggests me that RKLB really thought this through and proposed actual specific ideas and strategy whereas many other companies just threw buzzwords around.

RKLB_posts.csv,Preferential treatment of SpaceX under Trump presidency,"Hi there,

I was analyzing my portfolio and was wondering what the effect of a trump presidency would mean for RKLB, since I would imagine SpaceX will absorb most of the government contracts due to Elon musk being in close ties with Trump. I'm thinking this will push RKLB to push for a more commercial approach and less relient on government contracts. 

What do you think? I will say that I believe since RKLB is a fair bit smaller than SpaceX at this point. I doubt anything will really happen in terms of competitivity from SpaceX, but I'm wondering how you see RKLB in this situation. It might as well be that this presidency opens up new opportunities in terms of Space exploration.

RKLB_posts.csv,Space Systems Potential,"Spinning off a comment, on a post that may get deleted, I thought an interesting discussion might be had on the potential of the Space Systems side of Rocket Lab.

From one of the recent articles on the CHIPs award of $23.9 million to expand manufacturing capacity of space grade solar panels. 

‚ÄúPolaris Market Research to estimate that the global satellite solar cell materials market size will grow to $111.46 billion by 2032 at a compound annual growth rate of 13.2%.‚Äú

**Edit: the Zack‚Äôs/Yahoo Finance article says billions, but I‚Äôve been informed the actual Polaris Market Research says $111.46 million. I found other sources that say $1.1 billion for space solar by 2030. Either way, nowhere near the above do I edited this post. However, I still believe space systems as a whole will be a multi-billion dollar revenue stream in the coming years, just with less of that from solar than theorized above.**

We are all excited for the Neutron launch and joining the medium lift market, the increased revenue, the increased margin with reusability. And the fact it opens up the Space as a Service market with a constellation launched by Neutron‚Ä¶ I definitely am.

However, I think Space Systems is too often ignored in the future potential for Rocket Lab. Space systems, the manufacturing side of the business with space grade solar panels, reaction wheels, separation systems, satellite manufacturing, spacecraft manufacturing, etc‚Ä¶ access to that market is going to be absolutely huge over the next several years imo, and is going to be a huge revenue driver for Rocket Lab. The bad inherited contracts from the Solaero acquisition are pretty much done with, the company just received a CHIPs award to expand manufacturing capacity, and alongside the other parts of space systems, I really see this side of the company driving it into multi-billions of revenue pre-constellation revenue. It has an absolutely massive potential imo and could really crank revenue through the roof as the market grows over the next couple years. The Constellation for space as a service will just be the cherry on top at that point.

Thoughts?

RKLB_posts.csv,Why I'm Holding till 2030 at least. My RKLB DD post.,"# Introduction

I‚Äôve been following Rocket Lab since 2019, before it SPAC-ed in 2021. Having already known the company, I aped in following the SPAC announcement in the range of $12-$15. Slowly averaged down the cost through the SPAC-pocalypse. Average price probably in the range of $8-$10 not $4.78 as I changed brokers.

[Current position \~168,000 shares. \(\~140,000 shares are mine, the rest are held for family\) Have only trimmed \~10&#37; of shares in the recent run up as part of risk management, portfolio was 100&#37; in RKLB.](https://preview.redd.it/vn1prfwdko3e1.jpg?width=1093&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af5f6ad220bd27de3e600e6edb768f1ac71a63ae)

With the increase in stock price over the last few months and the increase in newcomers asking price target questions and new posts every time it hits a new round number, people asking if they should take profit as they expect a pull back to happen, there hasn‚Äôt been a proper DD post in awhile and I feel that many are not capturing the point that Sir Peter Beck's end goal for Rocket Lab is to be an **END-TO-END Space Company.** In my opinion it will be impossible to attribute a price target for $RKLB just simply because the industry is still in its infancy stage, instead, what is important is to see just how much of the growing space industry Rocket Lab could possibly capture in the next 5-10 years.

This is my own DD post and is not financial advise, I will attempt to cover and break down Rocket Labs business segments and why I will hold be a shareholder till 2030 and beyond.

[Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, spacecraft, satellite components, and on-orbit management - 2024 Q3 Earnings Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/xjvg1d975p3e1.jpg?width=1257&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fd1ccef8c9bea2cbd8d74e37fac398b64680181)

Although in the name, Rocket Lab is not just a launch provider, but an end-to-end space company providing, not just the launch service but also complete spacecraft design, manufacturing, satellite components and on-orbit management. Eventually, the company intends to use the experience to deliver and provide their own service from space through its own **satellite constellation**.

# Business Segments

**1. Electron**

[Electron is the only reusable orbital-class small rocket. Capturing and reflying Electron‚Äôs first stage enables higher launch frequency without expanding production and lowers launch costs.](https://preview.redd.it/okycitpk5p3e1.png?width=1345&format=png&auto=webp&s=453be91a7aad8274d7fef195c42eeb1daf48add2)

Electron is a two-stage, small-lift launch vehicle that is able to carry around 300kg to Low-Earth Orbit. Its Rutherford engines are the first electric-pump-fed engine to power an orbital-class rocket. Electron is often flown with a kick stage or Rocket Lab's Photon spacecraft.¬†

Proven Reliability ‚Äì Electron has already flown 14 times this year, achieving record cadence, over the 10 times flown in 2023. Electron is now the 3rd most frequently launched rocket globally in 2024. 54 launches (50 successes, four failures \~ 92.5% success rate)

Responsiveness ‚Äì Electron can launch from three launch pads across two hemispheres, from LC1 A/B in New Zealand, Rocket Lab‚Äôs privately owned launch pad or from LC2 in Wallops, Virginia. This has been demonstrated recently with a HASTE launch in LC2 and an electron launch within 24 hours on Nov 24/25.

[üöÄ Literally to the Moon - Electron's Capstone Mission](https://preview.redd.it/hq5mcset5p3e1.png?width=1786&format=png&auto=webp&s=dee6c94313ff18c3c7a9c27bc28a84338d2094ac)

Small but powerful ‚Äì On June 28, 2022, Rocket Lab launched a CubeSat to the Moon - a pathfinding mission to support NASA‚Äôs Artemis program which will land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon.

**Electron‚Äôs existential crisis, or not?** ‚Äì While Electron has limitations in terms of carry capacity of 300 kg to LEO and the threat of SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 Transporter Rideshare missions, Electron‚Äôs reliability and responsiveness together with its tailor-made missions have continued providing strength in demand evident from the signing of multi-launch agreements with its customers (Synspective, Capella Space, Blacksky etc.) Many discuss the threat of Electron being replaced by larger rockets, such as SpaceX‚Äôs Transporter rideshares or even Neutron cannibalising Electron in the future. However, just like taking an Uber directly to your destination or the bus somewhere near but not quite your destination, Electron together with its kick stage provides unrivaled accuracy, hitting target orbits with pinpoint accuracy.

**Why Capella Space chose Electron over Rideshare** 

‚ÄúInstead of burning propellant to raise altitude, it‚Äôs far easier to simply be dropped off at a higher orbit by the launch vehicle. Being able to go higher than available rideshare missions was a major factor in Capella‚Äôs decision to pull Capella-9 from its planned launch and procure a dedicated ride from Rocket Lab for Capella-9 and Capella-10, which were launched in March 2023 on an Electron rocket to a targeted 600 km. This was also a major motivation behind the follow-on contract for four dedicated launches on Electron rockets for Acadia-generation satellites, the first of which launched to a targeted 640 km in August 2023‚Äù

[Continued Strong Demand for Electron](https://preview.redd.it/9hfpllwg6p3e1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=89128d9ce6e6660cdcb992ff6f3fdf0609146069)

The demand for Electron is also seen to be strong with the Average Selling Price increasing to what was $7.5 million to now $8.4 million. Furthermore, many of Electron‚Äôs direct competitors, mostly small launch ‚Äòaspirational‚Äô space companies have now been eliminated from the market.¬†

It is NOT Rocket Science. Can‚Äôt really say that in this industry. Entrants to the small launch space have not fared well, many attribute it to a lack of demand as some pivot to larger launchers but in truth it seems that Electron has cemented its place as THE small launch provider.

**2. Haste**

https://preview.redd.it/v3l86x177p3e1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=30266164d98e447732f8e430c99bb58d3a4b887c

HASTE is a suborbital testbed launch vehicle derived from Rocket Lab‚Äôs heritage Electron rocket. HASTE provides reliable, high-cadence flight test opportunities needed to advance hypersonic and suborbital system technology development. Hypersonic speed is at least five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5 and above

[Types of Adaptions of Electron payload for HASTE vs Space-Based Orbital Electron](https://preview.redd.it/x7qeoojz7p3e1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b1fcbe1a09d5f8d9e6e7f8299e281d99bf53245)

# 

From air-breathing and glide payloads to ballistic and future technologies, HASTE is a cost-effective and responsive hypersonic testbed that enables precision payload delivery for every mission.

[Leidos was awarded $334M air-breathing hypersonic system contract](https://preview.redd.it/rzpb8vfp8p3e1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=4995acc3b4ce982c65204c7969cc708a73981ec1)

Rocket Lab has had two HASTE missions so far, with the first HASTE mission on 17 June 2023 for Leidos. Leidos was awarded [$334M air-breathing hypersonic contract](https://www.leidos.com/insights/leidos-awarded-334m-air-breathing-hypersonic-system-contract) in 2022.

Russia has already demonstrated its use of the Khinzal hypersonic missile in Ukraine and the Pentagon‚Äôs warning to the congress that China already possesses the world‚Äôs leading hypersonic arsenal, the United States still does not possess its own arsenal of hypersonic missiles. As the US plays catch up, Rocket Lab stands to win, with at least another 3 HASTE missions for Leidos for 2024/2025  as part of the MACH-TB (Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed program.

Instead of highlighting how large the Total Addressable Market hypersonics could be, it would be more useful to highlight the innovation of Rocket Lab and also management‚Äôs ability to understand its technologies to adapt and create new use cases.

**3. Space Systems**

[We Don't Just Build Rockets in this Lab](https://preview.redd.it/03v1c2fk9p3e1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=27f2b92571ecd7eb36c692bb14caf370aa86db7b)

While rockets are really nice to look at, it is important to understand that launch business makes up only 20-30% of revenue of Rocket Lab, with Space Systems making up the majority of revenue contribution. Rocket Lab‚Äôs expansion into Space Systems through in-house capabilities or through acquisition is what seems to be most under-rated by investors/analysts.

**THIS IS WHERE I AM REALLY BULLISH. RECURRING REVENUE. MORE STUFF IN SPACE = MORE RECURRING REVENUE**

Starlink satellites have a lifespan of about five years. After which it will re-enter the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere and be destroyed. Satellites need replenishing, and companies are heading towards mega constellations to provide their services, Rocket Lab will either manufacture, provide components, flight software or even deploy them with Neutron. With the space economy projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030, and $1.8 trillion by 2035. Rocket Lab‚Äôs position as an end-to-end space company seems like a no-brainer as long as the company is able to capture a portion and with more than 1,700 satellites launched to orbit with Rocket Lab technology already, it seems to be on the right path. Some highlights of Rocket Lab‚Äôs space systems.

**a. Reaction Wheels**

[Love that we now ship pallets of reaction wheels to constellation customers. - Peter Beck](https://preview.redd.it/fofd4136bp3e1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=26d87d2a06b834269b21f22762292abb2dd2e37a)

A satellite typically needs at least three reaction wheels to control its movement along the X, Y, and Z axes. However, satellites often have four reaction wheels for redundancy

Deal already signed with a [single confidential mega constellation customer ](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/24/rocket-lab-reveals-big-supplier-deal-with-mystery-mega-constellation-customer/#:~:text=In%20its%20data%20sheet%20on,the%20base%20price%20at%20%24100%2C000)for thousands of reaction wheels per year. If you‚Äôre wondering who it could be‚Ä¶ [Amazzz](https://www.youtube.com/live/wmmNuU8-Tr8?si=xpO2MeoKJ2KyHw5F&t=1218)

Amazon‚Äôs Kuiper constellation will have an initial 3,236 satellites Which likely will need replenishing every five years as well. That‚Äôs a good stream of recurring revenue for reaction wheels alone.

[\~4,000 to 5,000 satellites launched annually in 2030 - McKinsey](https://preview.redd.it/lmb1i4tmcp3e1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e5378628bdb2ce794333f878b8f54c530979638)

McKinsey anticipates in the base case, 27,000 active satellites in orbit by the end of 2030, almost a four-fold increase from today. To maintain that number at the assumed lifespan, there would need to be 4,000 to 5,000 satellites launched per year. In the high-demand scenario, in which nearly all proposed constellations materialize, McKinsey would expect to see more than 65,000 satellites, including many heavier ones, on orbit by 2030.

**b. Space Grade Solar**

[In 2022, Rocket Lab acquired leading satellite solar power producer SolAero Technologies. ](https://preview.redd.it/boenu4xrdp3e1.png?width=921&format=png&auto=webp&s=35bc3927f9baa504c4f498ec3ffddf844c274cd2)

Satellites need power. With the acquisition of Sol Aero, Rocket Lab is now one of the few space grade solar providers. Already there are more than 1,100 satellites in space powered by Rocket Lab solar products. The company has also been [awarded $23.9million](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-11-25/us-finalizes-awards-to-bae-systems-rocket-lab-for-semiconductor-chips) to boost the company‚Äôs production of solar cells by 50% over the next three years.

**c. Separation Systems**

[No separation anxiety - Example of Rocket Lab‚Äôs Separation System](https://preview.redd.it/i8s75ussep3e1.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a75dda0512efd875bab92e6f01da9ca86fee5d96)

In 2021 Rocket Lab acquired Planetary Systems Corporation which has designed, built, and delivered separation systems for more than 20 years with a 100% success rate - no product has ever failed to operate in flight. With the scale and resources of Rocket Lab behind the team, we are now making separation systems available globally at scale.

**d. Space Software**

[In October 2021, Rocket Lab acquired Advanced Solutions, Inc \(ASI\), a Colorado-based aerospace engineering firm delivering mission proven space software, mission simulation, and testing solutions.](https://preview.redd.it/quczg7jyep3e1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=98c4593cdd1a44f7e5e3377c5ea0b8be3c21a571)

As part of the end-to-end service, Rocket Lab also provides software and operation for customer satellites.

The vertically integrated and end-to-end space service Rocket Lab provides will allow customers who are looking to provide a service from space do so without any knowledge of building and operating spacecrafts.

Right now companies like Varda are still space companies applying pharmaceutical and life science applications, and even have outsourced [Rocket Lab will to conduct in-space operations](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-completes-second-spacecraft-for-varda-space-industries-advancing-in-space-manufacturing/), reentry positioning maneuvers, and deorbiting to recover Varda‚Äôs capsule while they attempt to develop the own in-house solutions. However, Rocket Lab's end goal as THE end-to-end space provider, is for companies with no knowledge of building or operating spacecrafts contracting Rocket Lab for its services.

**4. Catalysts**  
Written so much and I have not even covered Neutron, Space Race, Possibility with Mars Sample Return, NSSL Neutron On-ramping, SDA Contracts, Human rated Neutron launches. I'll point over to [Dave G Investing's video](https://youtu.be/rt4_g87TxL8?si=PHAi9oegs_13u0AL) on the potential nearer term catalysts, I think he covers it in great detail.

[Dave G Investing - Potential Catalysts](https://preview.redd.it/xvnfaef9jp3e1.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=540f11194cebd49866ceb72b3b7a7e6e628b4a0c)

Further term growth opportunities include Neutron signing more commercial launches to deploy constellations or even taking on some contracts to help deploy Kuiper if any of their launch providers for their 83 launches fail to deliver. Also as SPB mentioned, Neutron‚Äôs success will then allow for Rocket Lab to develop its own constellation. These catalysts really show the uncapped potential of the company, which makes valuing the company today extremely difficult, which is why I will be holding my shares, at least a good amount of it till 2030.

**5. Conclusion**

[This guy doesn't build shit](https://preview.redd.it/wqzjk4zmjp3e1.png?width=1505&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5b3ab591beb4426ff8223a327fa6c41f8e14b44)

Trust in SPB. He knows Rockets. Watch Wild Wild Space on HBO for those who haven't.

Rocket engineer at heart, he developed Electron with less than $100 million compared to rockets like Virgin Orbit's LauncherOne estimated to be over $1 billion and still failed.

RKLB_posts.csv,Let's talk MSR and competing proposals...,"MSR. So hot right now. For better or worse, I wanted to share my opinions on the likelihood RKLB gets the MSR mission.

I realize we only have the abstracts for the proposals, but it should be enough to tell us who is taking this seriously. I'm honestly flabbergasted at some of the proposals, and I've attempted to summarize the abstracts even further below. You'll quickly see that it's a two, MAYBE three horse race... and RKLB is in it.

* Rocket Lab: ""We put a lot of effort into this proposal, and intend to show you just why we are the perfect choice. We can and have done nearly everything you're asking a company to do, we have a proven track record and a reliable path to mission success, and we can do it faster and cheaper than anyone else.""

* Lockheed Martin: ""Sure, we can do it for your max budget and.... sometime... before 2040. We have lots of experience with this stuff, dude. We've partnered with you before and we sure liked all the cash you filled our coffers with. Give us the contract and we will do the bare minimum to meet any of your needs. But we're pals, man! Like, our relationship goes WAY back... and don't forget the lobbying money we spend! So... can we have the money now? kthx""

* Blue Origin: ""So you're already building SLS and HLS, so...let's like... leverage those options, and then you won't even need to worry about how many samples you can return! *SLAPS 4 BILLION DOLLAR ROCKET* This baby can fit SO MANY mars samples inside of it!! We can't talk about schedule because uh.... that's kind of on you (wink wink) but uh.... we think by using these options you might be able to accelerate your schedule? But listen to THIS... we've got a couple of super brainy Ph.D.'s leading a ""team"" of EXPERTS looking into all of this, and they have a whole 50 years of combined experience on mars missions! So uh.... pick us, and then we might actually take any of this seriously.""

* Quantum Space: ""We develop spacecraft. Or.... I guess... we're trying to. We haven't had any success at all, but we're smart cookies who think outside the box!! We think we came up with a novel but quite difficult approach to trajectory and spacecraft needs by basically doing a lunar orbit rendezvous and hand off of the samples to another vessel before returning to Earth. Sure, we know you're probably going to call this bullshit, be we prefer to call it a ""disruptive concept"""".

* Aerojet Rocketdyne: ""We're smart cookies and we take this seriously. We've already identified areas where we can reduce the mass of the theoretical MAV and SRL, and that would allow us to use existing technologies to get the lander on the surface. We've been doing this a long time and have a lot of success, and we've already started to figure out which propulsion technologies would fit into a mission like this or which would need to develop further. We really want to use the skycrane to land the MAV, and will likely concentrate all efforts on that front since it would speed things up considerably. The reduced mass MAV and SRL will allow us to return plenty of samples.""

* Northrop Grumman: ""So we are like, quite competent in propulsion, and we've been doing this stuff for like, a really long time. We will do some uh.... engineering.... and uh, we want some government money so we can keep developing our solid rocket motors. And then you can use them for this mission!! :D""

* SpaceX: ""Uhh... we're already going to mars. We don't know when, but.... we can just pick up your samples for you while we're there, and then charge you a shit ton of money for the privilege :) Sit back and relax!""

* Whittinghill Aerospace: ""We're a cutting-edge tech firm out of the Midwest, awaiting imminent patent approval on the next generation of ~~radar detectors (D2D)~~ MON hybrid rocket motors that have both huge military and civilian applications. Now, right now John, our stock trades over the counter at $0.10.... but we..... oh shit.... wrong number.""


So, alright then. We have some serious proposals, and we have some jokers. I think there are a few that you can remove straight off the bat. Whittinghill and Quantum Space. One is an engineering company, and the other makes spacecraft. Lots of companys do both, these companies do just the one, and are both quite small and not in a position to handle such an important contract. That widles us down from 8 to 6.

This is where it gets a little tricky, since we don't know what's actually in the proposals... all we have are the abstracts. But taking things at face value, there are a few additional proposals that don't really seem to be taking it seriously, or don't really offer any value to NASA by choosing them. Those options are Lockheed, BO, and Northrop. Yes, THOSE BIG THREE. Why? Lockheed is basically ""max budget, max timeline"". What incentive does that provide? BO relies on SLS sticking around AND on HLS sticking around.... which kinda feels like a complication of.... the SpaceX option? And Northrop can just pound sand. Their abstract is one of the worst in the whole bunch outside of Whittinghil and Quantum IMO. 

So... that leaves THREE actual ""competitors"" IMO. Let's dig into those. Rocket Lab, SpaceX, and Aerojet Rocketdyne, so let's start with Rocketdyne. They've put in the effort here, and have the company heritage to execute on their claims. They want to leverage existing technologies, while developing their rocket motors further so they can reduce the weight of the MAV. Smart cookies here, but no real promise on a timeline. Just vague talks of being able to 'accelerate' the timeline if they CAN leverage the skycrane the way they want. Solid choice, reasonable value to NASA. I give this option a B+.

Now let's talk about SpaceX. It's not so much a 'proposal' for a 'mission' as it is like, ""Hey Jim, I'm running to the store anyways. Want me to bring you back anything? Oh...no... I'm not going now. I'm going in like... 5-9 years... or something?"". It's not a BAD proposal, but without knowing the financials it's hard to say how likely NASA would be to choose this option. They're relying on HLS anyways, so if Starship is gonna be a thing, this could make sense. But they lose a lot of control, and who knows if their proposal is for a $9B budget and a return date in 2038? They don't say, and I don't think NASA will like losing that much control and influence on the mission. I give this option a C-. Feasible, but probably not NASA's best actual choice, since it really strips them of their autonomy.

And finally.... Rocket Lab. They can do it for under $2B on a fixed-price contract WAY earlier than NASA's requirement of 2040. They've built spacecraft, sent spacecraft to the moon using multiple trajectory burns, they've engineered and built spacecraft busses, reaction wheels, solar panels, navigation and guidance systems, rocket engines and rockets themselves, and they've even returned a capsule to earth that had samples inside of it already. They can do the entire mission, end-to-end, for 18.1% of NASA's budget, and get the samples here almost a DECADE earlier than required. Even IF NASA choose RKLB and they didn't deliver as promised, NASA would have SO much damn cash left to pursue other avenues (and presumably, almost a decade to do it...) that it would seem almost criminal for them not to select the RKLB proposal. RKLB could fail and they'd still be likely to succeed ""Hey Elon... grab us some samples on your next 2038 Mars mission... here's $5B"". Cool. NASA still got the samples back before 2040 and for $7B. I give this proposal an A-. The only thing keeping me from an A or an A+ is that Neutron isn't flying yet.

So, those are my big three that have a chance, but I personally think it boils down to Rocket Lab and Aerojet Rocketdyne. SpaceX is going to mars anyways, and like I mentioned above, we could just pivot to having them bring us back some samples a decade from now if things don't otherwise work out. For that reason, I give the SpaceX proposal a 15% chance of being selected, the Rocketdyne proposal a 40% chance of being selected, and RKLB a 45% chance of being selected. I'm assuming all the proposals I 'eliminated' earlier have a 0% chance, but that's likely not true. However, I wanted to simplify this.

So, from my seat, RKLB is actually the MOST likely proposal to be selected for MSR? Why? Execution, cost, and timeline PLUS the ability to NASA to pivot to SpaceX in the 2030's if necessary. Rocketdyne a close second.

RKLB_posts.csv,An Observation ,"I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre all excited about another monster trading session after a surreal run up.  I‚Äôm probably not the only one wondering each week if, and when, the eventual pull back is going to happen..  only to see the stock go higher.

I thought I‚Äôd share a quick story of an interaction earlier today to give some context to what many of us wrestle with.

I went to PT this morning, and we were shooting the breeze about life when she asked what I was up to.  We‚Äôre pretty good friends at this point, and the conversation drifted towards investing since it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm passionate about.  Naturally, Rocket Lab came up, and she was genuinely curious so I spent some time sharing the bullet points about the company, Peter Beck, the sector, etc.  The other two providers that were nearby joined in the conversation since they didn‚Äôt have clients at the time, and so I talked to them about it too.

What was absolutely fascinating to me was that none of them had ever heard of Rocket Lab.  These are intelligent, accomplished, capable medical professionals.  

People like to joke about you know it‚Äôs time to sell when you over hear Uber & Lyft drivers talking about a stock.  I think the opposite is true as well.  Anecdotally, outside of this sub, WSB, and X/twitter, there is practically no one in my professional or personal spheres that has heard of this company - unless I‚Äôve personally told them about it.  

My point is..  the recent run up as been incredible, and while there is a very real possibility of a drawback in the near future, especially for some unforeseen news or black swan event, this company is still one of the best kept secrets.  

Of course I could be wrong, and there is a lot of risk ahead and plenty that could go badly..  However, I think this is still just the initial wave crashing upon the shoreline.  Once more people clue in, it‚Äôs going to be interesting.

Tony Kim, Head of Technology Investing at BlackRock, discusses AST SpaceMobile and Rocket Lab at the Deutsche Bank Global Space Summit 2024.

‚ÄúIn the public market, I think there are two companies that are over $5B and they have been a recent resurgence, but it has been 20 years of hell. But there has been a recent resurgence of two companies that crossed $5B of market cap ‚Ä¶. And the two are not posterchilds of profitability. What they are is that they represent leadership. The power log ?
In the case of one company regarding potentially unlocking direct communications and the other one , the alternative to SpaceX on launch. So those are the two. They‚Äôre not really profitable yet, but they have the market valuation. The rest, they are mired in small subset of valuations? So yes, profitability is of course important, but I think more important is, are you a viable business with scale. Are you one of the companies that will achieve scale. And with scale comes profitability.‚Äù

I‚Äôve noticed a lot of posts lately asking, ‚ÄúShould I buy $RKLB now after the huge price increase?‚Äù Here‚Äôs a litmus test to help guide your decision:

First, ask yourself: If you already owned the stock, would you sell it now? If the answer is no because you think the price will continue to rise, then why wouldn‚Äôt you buy more now? If you believe in the company‚Äôs long-term future, the recent run-up shouldn‚Äôt deter you.

Remember, investors are in it for the long haul. Traders are the ones making short-term moves. And if you‚Äôre asking a biased community for financial advice, it‚Äôs probably a sign that you‚Äôre not the best trader. Timing the market is notoriously difficult, and most people don‚Äôt get it right.

So instead of focusing on short-term fluctuations, ask yourself if Rocket Lab‚Äôs long-term vision aligns with your investment goals. Don‚Äôt try to time the market‚Äîmake decisions based on your confidence in the company‚Äôs future.

As always, do your own research and assess your personal financial situation.

Neutron and a mega constellation, along with a thriving space systems business, is a ways away. That's the carrot at the end of the stick. Even so, that can't be the end of the story. I find it difficult to believe that is as far as it goes.

RKLB_posts.csv,Space operations and management constellation?,"With the imminent retirement of the NASA ""Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System"" (TDRS), I have been wondering if some sort of space operations and management constellation might be a good candidate for Rocket Lab's first space services constellation?

First some background courtesy of Chat GPT:

**What is the TDRS?**

The *Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System* (TDRS) is NASA's communication network used to support real-time data and command transmission between Earth and spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO), such as the International Space Station and the Hubble Space Telescope. Operating since 1983, TDRS consists of multiple geostationary satellites and ground stations, providing near-continuous coverage.

The system facilitates telemetry, tracking, and data transfer, enabling critical operations for various NASA missions. NASA is transitioning to commercial services as TDRS ages.

**What is the CSP?**

The *Communication Services Project* (CSP) is a NASA initiative aimed at transitioning from government-owned satellite communication systems, such as the TDRS, to commercially operated services. The CSP involves partnerships with private companies to develop and demonstrate advanced communication capabilities for space missions. These capabilities include satellite relay, ground-to-space communications, and data transmission, ensuring reliable and cost-effective support for NASA's future needs. The project is a cornerstone of NASA's strategy to leverage private-sector innovation for space infrastructure.

**What is SSA?**

*Space Situational Awareness* (SSA) refers to the ability to track and understand the behavior of objects in space, including active satellites, debris, and other spacecraft. SSA involves monitoring their positions, predicting potential collisions, and assessing risks to space operations. It is crucial for satellite operators, governments, and military organizations to ensure safe and sustainable use of Earth's orbits, particularly as space becomes increasingly crowded with new satellites and debris. SSA data is gathered using ground-based and space-based sensors, radar, and optical systems.

**What is a SON?**

*Satellite Operations Network* (SON) refers to the integrated system of ground stations, communication links, and software infrastructure used to manage, monitor, and control a satellite or a constellation of satellites. The SON ensures the execution of mission commands, monitors telemetry data, and facilitates two-way communication between satellites and operators. Advanced SONs often include automation, real-time data analysis, and tools for handling large-scale constellations with minimal human intervention.

**What is STM?**

*Space Traffic Management* (STM) refers to the planning, coordination, and execution of operations to ensure the safe and sustainable use of Earth‚Äôs orbital environment. It encompasses tracking space objects (satellites, debris), avoiding collisions, managing orbital slots, and coordinating launches. STM combines policy frameworks, technical systems (like SSA), and international cooperation to mitigate risks from space congestion and orbital debris, ensuring efficient and safe space operations for both public and private entities.

**What would you call a combined SSA, SON and STM system?**

A combined system integrating *Space Situational Awareness* (SSA), *Satellite Operations Network* (SON), and *Space Traffic Management* (STM) could be called an *Integrated Space Operations and Management System* (ISOMS) or *Unified Orbital Management Network* (UOMN).

Such a system would unify tracking, operational control, and traffic management functions, ensuring seamless coordination between monitoring orbital environments, controlling satellite constellations, and preventing collisions or other orbital conflicts. This integration would enable efficient and secure satellite operations in increasingly congested space environments.

Thanks Chat GPT!

I'm not suggesting that Rocket Lab will join other commercial entities participating in the CSP, there are already plenty of big names there including Kuiper and Starlink. Perhaps Rocket Lab may partner with some of them. But it occurs to me that if you want to build an end-to-end space company, that designs, builds and operates customer constellations, you'll need some of the same functionality that the TDRS provides NASA - and you may not want to rely on other commercial CSP entities to provide it.

Back over to Chat GPT:

**Describe a UOMN constellation? How many satellites? How many ground stations? What orbits required?**

A *Unified Orbital Management Network* (UOMN) constellation would likely require a combination of LEO (Low Earth Orbit) and MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) satellites to cover both tracking and communication needs. The number of satellites would depend on coverage requirements, but a network of 30‚Äì50 satellites could be sufficient for global tracking and communication.

Ground stations would be strategically placed worldwide, with at least 5‚Äì10 ground stations for redundancy and global reach. The system would also need robust inter-satellite links, especially for real-time traffic management and command/control capabilities.

Thanks Chat GPT!

OK so Rocket Lab would need some help with ground stations, and whilst they have their own RF space radios, they may also want to pick up some space optical expertise. With $300M in the Mergers & Aquisitions kitty, perhaps there are some targets?

RKLB_posts.csv,Valuation ,"I keep seeing comments that RKLB is cheap and SpaceX is overvalued. Or other commentary that sounds like it is based on faith and not thought out metrics. Full disclosure I'm bullish on both. 

Morgan Stanley has probably one of the most publicly available in-depth analysis of SpaceX value. They note that 60% of the value is in Starlink. That would make SpaceX rocket side about a $75B valuation. Given their launch revenue was estimated to be $5.5B for 2024 that is a revenue multiplier of 13.6x. Apply that to Rocket lab and you get a valuation of $10b on $245m of revenue and you have a revenue multiplier of 40.8x. 

RocketLab's launch business is three times more expensive to buy than SpaceX's right now. Not sure SpaceX is overvalued (on launch).  Starship is arguably a much bigger leap than Neutron (new model vs providing a launch alternative to existing model). So, not sure how SpaceX can be called overvalued and at the same time saying RocketLab has room for another 150% gain ($50 share).

If this is correct (and it was quick and sort price analysis), does RKLB benefit from IPO access and demand for the sector that cannot be easily accessed via SpaceX? Is there something else driving the multiplier difference? Yes both companies do more than launch, but one has turned that into revenue while the other is just starting down that path. And that portion of the valuation is pulled out of SpaceX in the above analysis and assumed to be $0 for RKLB. 

Maybe that's the difference. That the market is already valuing the non-launch business at even more astronomical multipliers than SpaceX's non-launch business.",60,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1gs6fmx/valuation/,0.8615,0.063,0.912,0.025

RKLB_posts.csv,Confidential Customers?  Expect more of them and why I‚Äôm accumulating shares.,"First of all I screwed up buy reducing my shares after it gained 200%.  I was buying at $3.5 - $6 and after a healthy increase I sold some around $10.  I still have a good amount and I‚Äôm accumulating again and here is why‚Ä¶

This latest launch was by a ‚Äúconfidential customer‚Äù and the new contracts for neutron are also from a ‚Äúconfidential customer.‚Äù  I knew they would beat earnings since the new customer wasn‚Äôt factored into the earnings forecast during the Q3 presentation so I bought a bunch more and calls just before earnings.  Be prepared to see ‚Äúconfidential customer‚Äù a lot from Rocket Lab in the future.  A lot of developed countries, especially in Europe, do not see Trump as an ally and now that Leon is part of the government they want to distance themselves from him and SpaceX.  If Trump installs large tariffs then you can easily predict a trade war.  The faster these other countries get up their own internet satellite systems the better.  Not only do they not want to rely on Starlink for secure communications, they don‚Äôt want to rely on SpaceX to put up their satellites.  This is where Rocket Lab will be taking full advantage of having non-U.S. based launch facilities.  For those that have been here awhile there were rumors of Rocket Lab acquiring a constellation builder in the U.K.  I fully expect that to happen now to service their European and Asian customers and be fully integrated from build to launch.   I bet we get news of that before the 4th Quarter earnings in February.  Several people that are very Pro SpaceX / Leon  won‚Äôt read this far and you will see responses from them below calling this bullshit and how SpaceX is far and away the only real private company option for other countries‚Ä¶.just watch.

My prediction is RKLB between $35 - $50 by the end of 2025 unless there is a black swan event.

Virgin Galactic merges with SCH to create SPCE, ushering in a new age of retail space investing‚Ä¶

Virgin Galactic, rooted in the genius of legendary aerospace designer Burt Rutan and Scaled Composites, becomes a public company via Richard Branson‚Ä¶

Virgin Galactic promises a bright future for future space tourists and investors. 

Branson would later take small satellite launcher, Virgin Orbit (VORB), public via merger with NextGen Acquisition Corp. 

Virgin Orbit wants it all. 

On September 25, 2020‚Ä¶ Vector Acquisition Corp goes public. 

On August 25, 2021,‚Ä¶ a young, fledgling space startup company founded by rocket bike connoisseur, New Zealander, gold-prospector, and cabbage patch look-alike, Peter Beck, merges with VACQ.

Rocket Lab enters the commercial space race as a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ. But legacy space and defense contractors dismiss RocketLab‚Äôs Electron rocket as too small for doing serious rocketry. 

It is early 2023‚Ä¶

After a global pandemic and nuclear winter for raising capital, the shakeout is in full swing. Space launch startups like Astra, Relativity, and Branson‚Äôs Virgin Orbit are teetering on the brink.  Claims of large 2B backlogs and realities of horizontal flying rockets will not save them from impending doom. 

On April 4, 2023, Branson‚Äôs Virgin Orbit files for bankruptcy, crushing hopes of a free satellite launching future not dominated by old school contractors and the SpaceX monopoly. 

The demand for satellite constellations and real-time global connectivity grows. 

It is June 20th 2024‚Ä¶

It is August, 2024‚Ä¶

However, Peter Beck confirms a hot fire later in the month.

The rate to borrow on [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rklb) for tomorrow is 3.3% APR. Now that's not really HIGH but it is much higher than it was the past week because the fee goes up when more people want to short it (read about it [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-loan-fee.asp)).  So more shorts interested in us.  The more shares short, the more downward pressure on the stock. 

I still see blanket 10M shares available short but I don't know where that info came from or if it's the 2 week lag that is often placed on the public info (and I don't have a subscription to the services that update it).  IBKR shows shares still available but that likely won't update until 7am EST tomorrow as well. 

There's too many brokers out there but if you are long the stock and you don't want your shares leant out (to be paid a portion of that 3.3% because brokers take their cut of course), you should google: ""\[insert your broker\] opt out of securities lending"". 

All the brokers think this is a good thing - [RH](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/stock-lending/), [Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/securities-lending), [Ally](https://www.ally.com/invest/self-directed-trading/securities-income-program/), [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/fully-paid-lending), etc. - Likely your broker has it too. They all ""want you to earn interest"" but to read up a bit more on [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitieslending.asp).. but they summarize to this:

So if you like it and want it to go up... decide what you want to happen.. don't let the brokers decide.. 

Clearly it's all our individual choices but just some information from the meme stock era that might help us all.

RKLB_posts.csv,Positive press for Firefly and its posture for competition against Neutron and others‚Ä¶,"What are your thoughts on the the heavy recent investment in Firefly? They appear to be targeting similar market segments to both Rocket Lab and Intuitive Machines - anyone here concerned about the potential for their medium launch vehicle to outcompete Neutron or otherwise siphon market share? 

From the article:
‚ÄúIn the hierarchy of launch vehicles, these one-ton-class rockets fit in between a class of heavier rockets, such as those from SpaceX, United Launch Alliance, and Blue Origin, and smaller launchers like Rocket Lab's Electron. Rocket Lab is the clear leader in the lighter launch segment, while Firefly is well ahead of its cohort in the one-ton launcher race. Like Firefly, Rocket Lab is also working on its own medium-class rocket called the Neutron‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNASA has awarded Firefly three task orders under the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. Firefly will soon ship its first Blue Ghost lunar lander to Florida for final preparations to launch to the Moon and deliver 10 NASA-sponsored scientific instruments and tech demo experiments to the lunar surface. NASA has a contract with Firefly for a second Blue Ghost mission, plus an agreement for Firefly to transport a European data relay satellite to lunar orbit.

Firefly also boasts a healthy backlog of missions on its Alpha rocket. In June, Lockheed Martin announced a deal for as many as 25 Alpha launches through 2029. Two months later, L3Harris inked a contract with Firefly for up to 20 Alpha launches. Firefly has also signed Alpha launch contracts with NASA, NOAA, the Space Force, and the National Reconnaissance Office. One of these Alpha launches will deploy Firefly's first orbital transfer vehicle, named Elytra, designed to host customer payloads and transport them to different orbits following separation from the launcher's upper stage.

And there's the Medium Launch Vehicle, a rocket Firefly and Northrop Grumman hope to launch as soon as 2026‚Ä¶‚Äù",6,20,https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/firefly-aerospace-rakes-in-more-cash-as-competitors-struggle-for-footing/,0.9769,0.095,0.891,0.014

Does anyone understand or can point to a source that explains the exact relation between Apple, Globalstar, MDA and RKLB ?

The way I understand it is Apple contracts Globalstar to operate a constellation to provide direct to cell services which then contracts MDA to build the spacecraft, MDA then subcontracts RKLB for most of the design / satellite bus

Sounds like the reaction wheels contract could maybe be for a Apple constellation rather than Kuiper

How do you see it and then what percentage of the 1.5 Billion can we execpt to subcontract its way to RKLB and maybe be announced at earnings next week ?

Options are very tempting at the moment given the run RKLB had this quarter. Every stock will have pullback. When it does, time value eat away potential profits.

Your best bet through earnings is to buy the stock and sell out of the money covered calls for November end. The money you make from the covered calls, you can put it back into RKLB to increase your share count. Don't despair if your options are called. Do it again.

Consider buying options when RSI goes below 40 and MACDs are in negative territory. This is where technical analysis will help you.

If the options you bought are expiring worthless, you giving free money to whales. A $1000 from you pocket may not seem much. But a hundred players like yourself giving free money to whales every week is Big Whale Money.

We are coming off a consolidation phase and a gap up occurred today. From a technicals point of view,

1. There was a shooting star candlestick pattern on 10/24. Stock dipped by about 15% from a high of 12.09 to a low $10.16 on 10/31.  After this it crossed $13.
2. No major catalysts during this period. 
3. MACD's are crossing over and turning positive

The setup is incredible going into the earnings. I love this uptrend and I am betting that SPB has some great news to share on the earnings call. IMO, There are people seeing ""A secular trend"" and that's the driver for this momentum.  I mentioned this in my previous post. Other than that, I have no inside information.

PS: To newbie options players. This is not the best time to sell CC's. Option buyers, the premiums are just too high. Nov15 $17 1254 contracts were traded for $0.12. That's ridiculous. Don't throw away your money. **Sometimes, you miss the boat. Accept it. Don't chase it. Buy shares instead.**

RKLB_posts.csv,Here's my take on Apple's $1.5 billion investment and the impact it could have on RKLB,"***\\!/ This is not financial advice \\!/***

For those who aren't aware already, Apple has just announced on Friday a $1.5 billion satellite investment with Globalstar to improve space-based communications for iPhones. The deal is expected to close on Nov. 5.

Here is all the information I could find in order to form a realistic expectation on the effects such a deal could have on RKLB.

First things first, Globalstar is the company with which Apple has been partnering with since 2022 to offer emergency services on its latest iPhones when terrestrial networks are unavailable. Globalstar is managing the constellation Apple uses to provide that service. It is specified in the deal that Apple will make cash payments of $1.1 billion to help Globalstar fund the new network of satellites but, it is also said that SpaceX is expected to begin launching those new satellites next year. It is important to note that Globalstar's constellation is in LEO (low-earth orbit) and that  their network does not \*yet\* provide more bandwidth-hungry services such as voice and broadband as of today.

**Back to 2022's subcontract with MDA:**

RocketLab is directly involved in Globalstar's ""old"" constellation because in 2022, RKLB was awarded a subcontract by MDA ""to¬†lead the design and manufacture of 17 spacecraft buses for Globalstar‚Äôs new Low Earth Orbit satellites"". MDA is the company that initially got the contrat to build those 17 new satellites. Rocket Lab is also developing the Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC) for the constellation. The Globalstar SOCC includes a continuous satellite control and monitoring using Rocket Lab‚Äôs MAX GDS, a constellation-class ground software solution that provides complete spacecraft command and control. What is also important to note is that the telemetry and control radio for all spacecraft will also be a C-band variant of Rocket Lab‚Äôs Frontier Satellite Radio (Frontier-C). Rocket Lab's Frontier Satellite Radios are Software-defined radio (SDR). SDRs are a radio communication system where components that conventionally have been implemented in analog hardware (e.g. mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, etc.) are instead implemented by means of software on a computer or embedded system. 

**What are spacecraft buses?:**

Spacecraft buses can be referred to as satellite platforms which are the support on which to mount instruments and the infrastructure for the mission such as power, communications to the ground and navigation. A spacecraft bus consists of everything needed to¬†transport, protect, and operate the payload. In our case, RKLB was in charge of the manufacturing of the satellite platforms in the 2022 contract and MDA was in charge of the payload which is the primary function of the satellite's mission. 

**MDA's new Aurora satellites:**

MDA announced their new Aurora satellite line in March 2024. Aurora is a new software-defined satellite product line which is basically a transition from analog to digital satellite technology. MDA has also made new partnerships with new companies to supply components for Aurora. 

Here's a list of a few partnerships I could find: 

1. Aerospacelab announced July 8, 2024 that it will provide more than 200 battery charge regulators for MDA Space‚Äôs Aurora satellites over a three-year period starting in 2026. These components are used to manage power distribution and battery charging in satellite systems. 
2. Airbus will supply more than 200 Sparkwing solar arrays that will be built on a designated line at Airbus' high-capacity production facility in Leiden, the Netherlands.
3. Switzerland‚Äôs Huber+Suhner was selected to supply more than 60,000 multi-channel radio frequency (RF). 

The list above refers to components that are used in the manufacturing of a satellite platform/satellite bus. If MDA was still using RKLB's satellite platforms, why would they buy components which are generally used for the making of the satellite platform and not the payload? 

Also, SDR setup involves an RF front-end connected to a computer that will perform the conversions from analog to digital. In other words and from my understanding, multi-channel radio refrequency (RF) is a component used in the making of a Software-defined radio (SDR). If MDA was still using RKLB's SDRs, why would they buy multi-channel frequency systems from another supplier? 

Obviously, I'm not an aerospace engineer or anywhere near that job industry, but prior to the launch of their new Aurora line, I personally think MDA needed RKLB's SDR to actually make their precedent satellite line ""Software-defined"". Since they've now developed their own fully software-defined satellite line, it doesn't seem like they'd still use RKLB's components. Also, the latest contracts for Aurora satellites do not mention any partnership with RKLB. In fact, MDA's press release in August 2023 about their contract with Telesat briefly mentions a new line of satellite and a transition from analog to software-defined satellites. It also seems like, by the recent partnerships MDA made for Aurora's components, that MDA is now making their very own satellite buses also. 

**From all the information above, here's what I think:**

1. It doesn't seem like RKLB is going to be the launch provider since SpaceX is already slated to begin launches in 2025. 
2. In November 2023, MDA received an Authorization to Proceed (ATP) contract from an undisclosed customer to start work on a new Non-Geostationary Orbit (NGSO) satellite constellation (valued at $180 million). The definitive contract for the full constellation (valued at around $750 million) is expected in 2024. We can hope for the unnamed customer to be linked to Apple's new investment since the contract and the constellation' valuations both make sense, price wise, with the total investment made by Apple's and the $1.1 billion payments that will be made to Globalstar in order to help them fund the new constellation. The timeline between the ATP with MDA and Apple's announcement for their new investment also both make sense. However, if that contract actually turns out to be tied to Apple's new investment, I'm not really optimistic on the fact that Rocket Lab is still involved in the spacecraft bus manufacturing.
3. Because Apple's main objective with their new investment is to improve space-based communications for iPhones, I see this new investment as an extension to their first partnership with Globalstar back in 2022. That being said, I think it would make sense if Globalstar continues to use Rocket Lab's constellation-class ground software for their new satellite constellation because from my understanding, the new constellation's purpose is to act as a complement to the one currently operated. 
4. Globalstar didn't want to elaborate on the upgrades their new constellation would bring to space-based communications on iPhones. By looking at RKLB's old press releases about the 2022 contract, I've found this very precise sentence: ""These new satellites and SOCC will augment Globalstar‚Äôs existing constellation delivering reliable mobile satellite voice and data services from space."" However, Globalstar's current constellation does not \*yet\* provide more bandwidth-hungry services such as voice and broadband as of today. Is it possible that the new satellites partly built by RKLB would provide such an upgrade to GlobalStar's currently offered services?

RKLB_posts.csv,Not astrology! Promise!!!  Just sharing what I have been watching on the latest uptrend‚Ä¶,"Not an astrologer.

(Post is) Not really a conversation starter or anything too noteworthy, but sharing because it does display strength and accumulation. 

Nfa though. I‚Äôm sharing something that reinforces my thesis. Rocket Lab will be 100$ a share and it won‚Äôt be a pump and dump (long time from now, but it‚Äôs happening).

This is how I know.

Connecting the chart / daily price action, and the accumulation that has happened on this uptrend... 

When share price has dipped to the low end of a range (chart flattens out for a week or so), I have noticed large scale orders spike (not retail buys, massive buys). Noticed the same thing when the candles trade sideways on each step of the staircase on this last rise. The large orders hit the tape on the lower end of the price range. Then, share price takes the next step up.

Like I said, nothing noteworthy. What it displays though can give you, us dumb money retail investors, a little more confidence in holding your shares. You selling isn‚Äôt going to really do anything to the price, not trying to sell you on my thesis‚Ä¶. but maybe it will help you not bail on an opportunity to change your financial situation without doing anything‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt get scared out of your position. 

The spikes on the price cost distribution chart display consolidation / institutional buying in at the low end of the trading range / building positions. 

To connect the images simply‚Ä¶

First image displays the daily chart, each candle is 1 day. The sideways price action is accumulation and is directly correlated to the spikes on the ‚Äúcost distribution chart in second image. Then the last image displays the order flow for today. Notice the large scale orders. That is not retail investors. That is institutional buying and they hold their shares for a very long time. This allows share price to keep going up. Gradually, and not without dips.

Blackrock owned 4.9% of the company (just under disclosure requirements / 13 g). They bought another 1.1% of the company (disclosed last week, think they have 15 -30 days to file the 13). Yes they own everything, but a ~6% position is not to be ignored.

More institutions will follow. Current institutional ownership is just over 57%. Has increased steadily since the decrease in inst ownership when Kholsa distributed shares / lock-up ended. That was when price was ~ 4.50. 

If something negative happens (news / launch failure) look at the spike on the price cost distribution chart below the one we are at now. That is what stock astrologers call support levels. Buy more then. Usually takes another negative event to break that one.

This is the easiest money I have ever made. I‚Äôm just a science teacher. Money for nothing is welcomed. 

You do you, but hope you make money. There is plenty to go around. Would hate to see institutions make that money instead of you all reading Reddit posts on a Thursday night.

RKLB_posts.csv,Mars Sample Return Mission Abstract - Rocket Lab's (former NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory) Richard French,"Everyone here has heard about the NASA Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission for which Rocket Lab is carrying out a study, which may lead to a NASA contract for either a full mission or some parts thereof. 

Let's take a look at Richard French, the Rocket Lab's man who is mentioned in the MSR studies abstracts of selected proposals published by NASA. Mr. French was mentioned in the Rocket Lab's news article of 2024/09/05 as a decorated NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) lead system engineer who, among other achievements, helped land the Curiosity Rover on Mars:, before moving to a managerial role at NASA HQ and later JPL's STO:

>Rocket Lab,¬†the global leader in dedicated small satellite launch, has appointed Richard French to the role of Director ‚Äì Global Government Launch Services. Joining Rocket Lab **following 12 years at NASA‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)**, Mr. French‚Äôs new role will see him focus on providing launch and on-orbit solutions for United States civil space customers such as NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as international civil space customers.

>In his previous role at NASA JPL, **Mr. French spent several years as an engineer working across various missions**, including the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission (for which he won the **NASA Honors Early Career Public Achievement Medal** for his work as **a lead system engineer**) **and** **helping to land the Curiosity Rover on Mars**. After moving into **a managerial role in the Space Technology Mission Directorate at NASA HQ, and then JPL‚Äôs Space Technology Office**, he made significant contributions in implementing public-private partnerships with companies like Blue Origin, Astrobotic Technology, and Made in Space, and helped stand up NASA‚Äôs first start-up accelerator program with Techstars.

>(...)

>‚ÄúRichard‚Äôs extensive experience at NASA and his work on commercial and government partnerships made him the obvious choice to lead government services at Rocket Lab,‚Äù says Lars Hoffman, Senior Vice President ‚Äì Global Launch Services. ‚ÄúRocket Lab is proud to offer frequent, reliable, and streamlined launch services to small satellite operators, and I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing¬†Richard expand on Rocket Lab‚Äôs premium experience for our government customers.‚Äù

>Mr. French says: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited for the opportunity to continue enabling government agency space missions, but this time from the industry side and with the leading dedicated small satellite launch provider. I‚Äôm looking forward to building on the already impressive capabilities of Rocket Lab for government missions and working with government agencies to better support the expansion of commercial space.‚Äù

RKLB_posts.csv,To the Ones Sleeping on RKLB,"A few months ago I stumbled upon RKLB and it was hella low‚Ä¶ but I never pulled the trigger. As of late it‚Äôs been moving and so naturally i‚Äôve been looking into it more and more and wanted to get a feel for how it stacks up against the competition (This is just for people who are relatively new‚Ä¶ very obvious info). Rocket Lab is up against companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and some smaller guys like Astra and Firefly Aerospace.
 
Obviously Musk is the big dawg of the commercial space sector, with a $210 billion valuation. They dominate the industry with cheap rideshare missions for small satellites, which is bad news for Rocket Lab since they‚Äôre targeting the same market. Pretty much‚Ä¶. SpaceX‚Äôs scale and success are the biggest threats to Rocket Lab, hands down‚Ä¶. especially with the funding they just pulled too.

Blue Origin, while worth around $12 billion because they have Bezos running the show, the company is absolute dogwater for now and 0 threat. They are yet to surpass a suborbital launch lmao.

Now, Astra and Firefly are smaller but focused on launching small satellites at low costs. They‚Äôre not doing as many launches as Rocket Lab, but they could be disruptive by offering cheaper alternatives in the future but for now it's nothing crazy.

One company in this whole commercial space industry that kinda made me pause was Virgins Orbit. To really understand Rocket Lab‚Äôs position, I started looking into Virgin Orbit‚Äôs story. Basically for some background, they were another promising company in the small satellite market, valued at around $200 million before going bankrupt in 2023. This got me thinking though‚Ä¶ was Virgin Orbit ever worth more? Turns out, at its peak, Virgin Orbit was valued at around $3.7 billion because of the hype around their air-launch system.

That‚Äôs when I started to feel a little nervous. If Virgin Orbit, a company once worth billions, could go bankrupt, what about Rocket Lab? With a current valuation of $5.5 billion, it‚Äôs not that far off. Given how tough the space industry is (super high costs, tons of competition, substantial loss when things go bad, etc), it‚Äôs a fair question to ask if Rocket Lab could face a similar fate.

After digging deeper (GPT search is goated for this), I found some key reasons Rocket Lab is way more robust and unlikely to follow in Virgin Orbit‚Äôs footsteps:

* Unlike Virgin Orbit, which struggled with consistent operations and reliability, Rocket Lab has a proven record of successful launches. As of now, Rocket Lab has completed dozens of successful Electron launches, building customer confidence and expanding its market share. Looking at Virgin Orbit‚Ä¶. Basically they had only completed a handful of launches and faced way more technical issues. Rocket Lab's reliability in delivering payloads on time and at a competitive cost is a significant advantage over the difficulties Virgin Orbit experienced.  
* Rocket Lab is not solely dependent on launch services. It has successfully diversified into spacecraft design, satellite components, and satellite management services, which provide additional revenue streams. This strategic diversification helps mitigate the risks associated with relying solely on launch operations, which was one of Virgin Orbit‚Äôs weaknesses. Virgin Orbit primarily focused on air launch technology.  
* Rocket Lab has future projects like the development of the Neutron rocket, which will allow it to compete in the medium-lift launch market, giving it access to larger payloads and way more lucrative contracts. At this point‚Ä¶ Virgin Orbit was still trying to establish itself in the smaller payload market when it encountered financial troubles (so they weren't even able to get past logistics). . Additionally, Rocket Lab has been working on reusability with Electron, which could further reduce costs and increase profitability over time, a significant factor that Virgin Orbit lacked.  
* Rocket Lab has raised significant capital and managed its finances well, with plans to grow its business strategically. Virgin Orbit, despite its initial $3.7 billion valuation, faced liquidity issues and struggled to raise funds, eventually leading to bankruptcy. Rocket Lab‚Äôs revenue has been growing steadily, and while it is not yet profitable, the company's long-term plans for increasing revenue through more launches, satellite services, and new rocket developments give it a clearer path to profitability than Virgin Orbit ever had.  
* The demand for small and medium satellite launches is growing due to the rise of satellite constellations for communications, earth observation, and defence. Rocket Lab is well positioned to capitalise on this, having established itself as a trusted provider. Virgin Orbit‚Äôs limited ability to scale and capture a significant portion of this growing market played a role in its downfall.

So yeah, while I had some initial concerns comparing Rocket Lab to Virgin Orbit‚Äôs downfall, it‚Äôs clear that Rocket Lab is in a much stronger spot

RKLB_posts.csv,In response to the bears (aka the liberal arts bull case for RKLB),"A few days ago I had an exchange with a guy who posted various pics Archimedes vs Raptor rockets.   A link to the thread ( https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/s/HOahYRJsur ), but the guy‚Äôs comments were deleted either by himself or the mods(?).  

In any event, it started out as just one of any number of posts going on about space x being so far ahead that nobody can compete.  I think the poster was a provocateur but also argued in good faith.  I found him to be broadly representative of a demographic of investor whose biases (technical snobbery and industry experience) are commonly found in arguments against Rocket Lab.  I think that those points are worth further discussion. 

I‚Äôm NOT an engineer (and this poster snidely pointed this out, in response to my comment that I don‚Äôt care about Archimedes looking like a wiry mess compared to Raptor).  I‚Äôm also not a quant of any type.  I focus on soft factors - culture, broad market structure, political and social movements.  I am a liberal arts shit head investor, and am proud to be one.  I was on NVIDIA in early 2022 (after many techies, yes,  but still before the market as a whole) because I read some novels about AI and read about GPT 3.  Not to toot my own horn, but focusing on soft factors like ‚Äúhow will other people perceive this technology?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhere are the potential bottlenecks in developing it?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat companies are critical to this but have relatively low overall public awareness?‚Äù were critical to pointing me to Nvidia.  Much of the same analysis points me to Rocket Lab.

‚ÄúRocket Lab is technically inferior to Space X‚Äù.  Nobody disputes this. I take it as a given.  There is a wide gulf.  But does it matter?  Only if the technological gap cannot be overcome in the long run.  Why would Space X have an insurmountable technological moat?  It could only be one of three reasons:

1. The tech is too hard to replicate
2. The talent for developing the tech will only be at Space X
3. Space X will drive its competitors out of business before they can attain technological parity. 

As to 1, this is not true.  Saturn V rockets have existed for like 50 years.  Building rockets is hard but it does not require any significant breakthrough in fundamental science to match Space X.  I think this is not controversial.  It‚Äôs a question of scaling, money, processes, quality control, not fundamental scientific knowledge. 

As to 2: the commenter argued something to the effect that given space X‚Äôs advantage, no engineer would want to work for RKLB. This , frankly , struck me as prime Boomer Logic.  We have seen time and again that top talent wants to take risks and get exposure to upside.  Yes many engineers like to work for a more established company, but many will simply want the challenge, glory, and financial rewards associated with working for start up (or in RKLBs case, a mature start up with room to run).  

As to 3: Beck himself often rightly points out that monopolies usually do not last in the long run.  While this is less true in extremely capital intensive industries , he is generally correct and his point is buttressed by 2 additional facts.  A) space is a national security issue and B) Space X is and must remain a privately held company ( if it is to continue to pursue its mars goal).

I asked the poster to tell me who controlled airplane manufacturing during World War 2.  He responded a small number of companies incestuously subcontracted with each other and later consolidated into a handful of mega contractors due to government intervention. He made my point for me.  Vital national defense concerns are never run by pure monopoly; oligopoly is the rule.  This is because the market is artificial.  The government cannot tolerate a single company having a chokehold on vital capacity such as launch and space systems manufacture.  It requires somewhat competitive bidding.  It requires redundancies.  It also requires its contractors to satisfy national security laws regarding sourcing, supply chain, secrecy, clearances, etc.  Rocket Lab has come farther than any of its direct competitors (other than, obviously, Space X) in terms of being able to satisfy the governments requirements and delivering a product that works as advertised.  At minimum, Rocket Lab can deliver components for other launch providers ; the best case is that it can be one of 3-4 major government contractors in terms of taking payloads into orbit. 

The private vs public structure is also quite important.  Public companies are subject to disclosure laws that do not apply to private companies.  Control is dispersed, not concentrated in one person or small group.  This is a superior governance structure for the purposes of winning public confidence and political support.  Space X cannot go public in the near term because its stated goal of going to Mars will be severely compromised by introducing any form of outside governance.  I do take Musk at his word; mars is THE objective. Thus, it must remain in the hands of an idiosyncratic billionaire with many political enemies.  All the more reason for US and world governments to foster competition and incubate alternatives. 

None of this is to say that rocket lab will come out as one of the favored group of competitors- it is still a long, hard road with a lot of risk.  But I do not buy the thesis that SpaceX is untouchable and I do believe that RKLB is one of the top contenders.",105,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1g8mmdo/in_response_to_the_bears_aka_the_liberal_arts/,0.9926,0.122,0.802,0.076

Any newbs out there that don‚Äôt know this, RocketLab last year had had to punt being on boarded because they no longer had a credible path to launch in 2024.

These are yearly awards, so for shit and giggles let‚Äôs say Neutron scores half these launches.

4 launches at probably 70 to 80 million (DoD are extra juicy compared to a standard 55 million dollar launch.) That revenue is what RocketLab has made this entire year so far.

Tbh. that news is shocking. BlueOrigin spend billions of dollars and years of development (development started in 2011, was announced in 2014, first launch in January 2024) and right now they need 10 days to produce 1 engine?  
RocketLab started development of Archimedes in 2021, as a ox rich cycle in September 2022.  
We won't come by exact production numbers, but my educated guess is that they are currently producing about 1 engine per month.

In the Q2 earnings presentation they wrote that engine 2 were coming off the production line. 5 more were in production. And as Peter Beck wrote in context with the recent Archimedes video, engine number 3 already should fix the copper issue.

Of course Elon is going to use a Trump administration to kill off competition. Trump will direct every mission, NASA and DOD to SpaceX.

This could kill Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, Axiom, Sierra, Relativity and any company that could compete with SpaceX in the future. This would be a tragedy for the whole industry that is just getting started. ULA will probably survive because they have been around the longest and have their own friends on capitol hill. But it will just be those two around SpaceX and ULA under Trump, that's my prediction.

On the Flip side if Kamala gets in I think they will actively divest from SpaceX wherever they can, due to Elon dislike. They'll be stuck using Dragon for a while because it's the most proven vehicle in the US (RIP Starliner). But I could see Dream Chaser getting another look from NASA.

RKLB_posts.csv,A revelation I‚Äôve come to realise,"One of the biggest unknowns we‚Äôve had about Neutrons commercial success, is how well it will actually compete with Falcon 9. I for example, have always been hopeful, but a bit unsure about the fact that Neutron can only put 13 Tons into LEO in reusable configuration, compared to a much higher offering from Falcon 9.

Until the penny dropped that Falcon 9 is a mature design that‚Äôs been in production and service for well over a decade, and has seen many iterations and evolutions over it‚Äôs life.

I searched it up, Falcon 9s first ever iteration ‚Äúv1.0‚Äù could only put 9 tonnes into LEO, and it wasn‚Äôt reusable. The second iteration ‚Äúv1.1‚Äù could put 13 tonnes into LEO, and wasn‚Äôt reusable. It wasn‚Äôt until v1.2 came about in 2015 that it could then put 18.5 tons into LEO in reusable configuration and 22.8 Tons into LEO as an expendable rocket. It then later got refined into its next iteration ‚ÄúBlock 5‚Äù, but it‚Äôs payload capacity stayed the same, and the en you‚Äôve got Falcon Heavy which obviously has the higher capacities again.

So when you compare this to Neutron, it‚Äôs starting out brilliantly already. Considering Neutron is a foetus and Falcon 9 is a fully matured vehicle by now, and even so, F9 in its current state can only put 5.5 more tons into orbit than Neutron can (with both in LEO reusable configuration respectively). 

It‚Äôs safe to assume that as Neutron and Archimedes go through the development process and receive updates/iterations as it goes through its life and matures, that Neutron will be a very strong contender to Falcon 9. I mean, we already know that Archimedes in it‚Äôs current stage of life, will be operated at pretty low stress levels. And even at low stress levels, it‚Äôs starting considerably further ahead than where Falcon 9 started its life. Over the years of neutron being in service, when Rocket Lab refine and improve on their base design of neutron, when they learn more about Archimedes and how far they can push it whilst still being reliable to launch again and again and again, it seems safe to assume that Neutrons payload capacity will see decent payload improvements.

But my main point to realise is that Neutron is starting its life, leaps and bounds ahead of where Falcon 9 started its life, in terms of payload capacity and the fact that it will be reusable right from the outset. Obviously, this isn‚Äôt all down to Peter Beck masterclass, it‚Äôs been over a decade since F9 came to life, and technology has moved on since then. Still though, with this in mind, I feel a lot more confident about the argument of ‚ÄúHow will Neutron compete with Falcon 9‚Äù. 

Will we see a neutron heavy? I doubt it but I‚Äôd love to be proven wrong in 5-10 years time. But with this in mind, not even taking into account that certain clients may pick rocket lab purely because it‚Äôs the only option that isn‚Äôt Elon Musk, AND the fact that Rocket Lab will offer end to end space services unlike SpaceX, AND the fact that Rocket Lab missions are tailored to their customers better and have a more precise orbit insertion, I think it‚Äôs pretty reasonable to assume that Neutron will at the very least, give Falcon 9 a good run for their money. 

The only thing that does still worry me slightly is that Falcon 9 has more than paid off for it‚Äôs self by now, so SpaceX will be able to price gouge/undercut Rocket Lab as much as they want (within reason), and Rocket Lab can only lower their prices so far to match it, after all, they have years of neutron service ahead of them to pay off the development costs.",59,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fttb0l/a_revelation_ive_come_to_realise/,0.9898,0.109,0.836,0.055
RKLB_posts.csv,Huge component of the business not yet factored into share price,"I wanted to point out something that others have mentioned before, particularly Vince is Bullish:

Peter Beck has said more than once that Rocket Lab is aiming to launch 50% of their rockets for customers and 50% of their rockets for themselves. This is because one of the primary purposes of their business is to create some sort of space infrastructure akin to SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink - some type of constellation that provides a service with high value for customers and high profit margins for Rocket Lab.

SpaceX‚Äôs valuation ballooned (almost doubled) to $200B since Starlink has come online.

When ASTS simply mentioned their constellation contract with AT&T, their market cap 10x‚Äôd in 3 months (before they had put anything into space).

Rocket Lab is fully vertically integrated (ASTS had to use a SpaceX rocket to get their first 5 satellites for AT&T into orbit). Once Rocket Lab is ready to begin building their own constellation, they‚Äôll be able to do it at significantly lower cost than ASTS.

The only reason Rocket Lab‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt moved on these repeated announcements of Peter Beck‚Äôs 50/50 plan for the company is that they haven‚Äôt announced exactly what their constellation will be yet.

But anyone that knows this company can pretty safely assume it‚Äôll be a success that drives huge profits.

Remember, ASTS moved 10x on news of a constellation. Rocket Lab has announced a constellation too but there‚Äôs been zero movement (recent movement is due to other reasons like Neutron progress and price upgrades).

Once they announce the purpose of their constellation and provide a roadmap with more details, the stock could easily 2-5x in a handful of months. This will almost certainly occur simultaneously with the first successful flight of neutron or shortly after (6-12 months).

RKLB_posts.csv,RKLB Short Term Bear Thesis (Long Term Bull),"The intention of this post is to outline why I consider RKLB to be an outstanding company with an overvalued stock price. I‚Äôve been lurking on this sub for quite some time, and I frequently see people making bold price projections for RKLB‚Äôs future stock price with little to no substance backing up their estimates. That being said, I would like to provide a detailed breakdown for why I believe RKLB‚Äôs fair value is approximately $6 per share right now. This is a short term (1 year or less) projection, not a long term projection. I look forward to hearing your feedback and seeing where we differ in opinion.

*Let‚Äôs start with the good stuff. This encapsulates basically everything but the stock price.*

**Strong Leadership**
Peter Beck is exactly the right person to be running this company. He has the perfect blend of intelligence, charisma, and modesty to make the company as successful as it has been. The track record of successful launches that RKLB has achieved is a tremendous achievement for someone that, unlike his main competitors (Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, Elon Musk), does not have more money than god. I also see no concerning loss of senior talent, and I've seen an ability to attract new talent in recent months. Quality leadership is the most important thing I look for in an investment, and RKLB appears to have that in spades.

**Successful Track Record**
As mentioned earlier, the track record RKLB has achieved with Electron has been spectacular. 53 launches with minimal failures speaks volumes about the quality of the engineering talent at RKLB. Unlike many other people that have a negative take on RKLB, I actually don‚Äôt think that Neutron will struggle to reach a successful track record of launches and profitability. The recent hot fire test of the Archimedes engine was impressive, and it appears RKLB is on track to meet their goals with Neutron.

**Positive Catalysts**
There are several catalysts which I believe could completely annihilate my expectations for RKLB‚Äôs stock to decline in the near to mid term. First, an overall increased interest in the space industry from the market as a whole. Markets are always looking for the next hot thing, and it‚Äôs entirely possible space could be that. Just like artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, SPACs, etc., the space industry at large could see a significant uptick in investor interest. This could lead to an increase in RKLB‚Äôs multiple and stock price without necessitating an increase in revenue or profitability. Secondly and tangentially, an IPO of SpaceX could greatly increase RKLB‚Äôs visibility in the market. I believe a SpaceX IPO would cause a rising tide that raises all ships in the space industry, and RKLB would benefit. Lastly, I believe RKLB has a substantial amount of ‚Äúmeme stock‚Äù potential. The company‚Äôs name has been spreading within the forums of people that invest in meme stocks, and it‚Äôs possible RKLB could be the next big one as many of those speculators lose faith in GME, AMC, etc.

*Now let‚Äôs talk about the negatives.*

**Revenue/Profitability**
I believe it is fairly easy to project out RKLB‚Äôs likely profitability over the next 1-3 years, and I don‚Äôt expect to see many positive surprises on either top line revenue or bottom line earnings. Revenue is rising, but predictably, and I don‚Äôt see any significant catalysts for revenue to surprise on the upside. The revenue isn‚Äôt explicitly a negative as revenue growth has been strong, but the stock price relative to revenue is beginning to become unsustainable. 

RKLB became public in 2021 through a SPAC so we can‚Äôt too far back with their financials. In 2020 with seven Electron launches, RKLB had $35MM in revenue or about $6MM per launch.  In 2021 with six launches, RKLB had about $62MM in revenue or about $10MM per launch. In 2022 with nine launches, RKLB had $211MM in revenue or about $23MM per launch. In 2023 with nine launches, RKLB had about $244MM in revenue or about $27MM per launch. For the last 12 months (June 2023-June 2024) across twelve launches, RKLB had about $326MM in revenue or about $27MM per launch. These numbers show strong growth in launch count, total revenue, and revenue per launch. As we all know, most of RKLB‚Äôs revenue is outside of launch services, but their ability to launch successfully is critical for their future ability to generate revenue and profitability across all their business lines. For the first half of 2024, RKLB had about $200MM in revenue and they are projecting about $100MM in the third quarter. For the full year, I am assuming they settle in around $400MM in revenue for the year. Very solid revenue growth compared to 2023.

That‚Äôs all positive, but the stock price as compared to that revenue is overheated, from my perspective. Based on most recent valuations, it appears the market leader in RKLB‚Äôs industry is currently valued at about 23x 2023 revenue or 15x projected 2024 revenue. Obviously, SpaceX is a private company that is valued differently than in the public markets, but this multiple seems reasonable for the industry‚Äôs profit margins and growth expectations. I‚Äôm aware that RKLB‚Äôs business lines aren‚Äôt identical to SpaceX‚Äôs, but I believe Wall Street will utilize similar logic when establishing an appropriate multiple for RKLB. However, given SpaceX‚Äôs dominance in the industry and the significant amount of execution risk remaining in RKLB‚Äôs growth trajectory, it would be appropriate to apply a lower multiple to RKLB to account for this risk. At a stock price of $10 or a market cap of about $4.9BB, RKLB is trading at a 20x multiple on 2023 revenue or 12x expected 2024 revenue. From my perspective, this is not a large enough discount compared to SpaceX. I believe that RKLB‚Äôs multiple should be no more than half of SpaceX‚Äôs - 11.5x 2023 revenue or 7.5x projected 2024 revenue. This would equate to a market capitalization of $2.8BB to $3.0BB. This range of market capitalizations would equate to a stock price of $5.50 to $6.00 per share.

**Psychological $10 Barrier**
As previously mentioned, RKLB IPO‚Äôed through a SPAC merger back in 2021 at about $10 per share. After experiencing a large but short-lived pump in the share price, the stock quickly dove down to the $4-$5 range where it stayed for years. Investors that entered a RKLB position at IPO or in the immediate run-up post-IPO are finally seeing an opportunity to exit the shares of a company that has done nothing for them for years as the S&P, Dow and Nasdaq have hit record highs. That being said, I think $10 will be a very difficult barrier to break both for practical and psychological reasons. The vast majority of companies that IPO‚Äôed via a SPAC are still trading below their IPO price today. Increases in the share price above $10 are likely to be short-lived as we saw on September 30th, the first trading day after public confirmation of the successful hot fire tests of the Archimedes engine. 

**Conclusion**
In summation, I believe RKLB‚Äôs share price is experiencing a short term pump above what I‚Äôd consider to be a sustainable market capitalization based on their current and future revenue expectations. I expect the shares to return to $6 range before year end. I do not expect the shares to return to the $4 range. In the spirit of disclosure, I should mention that I previously worked for a private equity company that still holds a substantial stake in RKLB and SpaceX, but I was not directly involved in the private equity arm of the company so I had no special access to their investment theses or MNPI. I do still own approximately $50,000 in equity shares of my previous company. As it relates to more direct RKLB-related investments, I have a number of November 2024 put options with a $7 strike price that I paid approximately $.20 per share for.

RKLB_posts.csv,Why I think RKLB is a hold ,"I'm seeing a lot of new people popping up in this sub talking about gainz for ants. Y'all shortsighted motherfuckers. Look at the macro picture: 

1. US/China space race heating up. China is seen as a ""pacing challenge"" by the US military. Last time this shit happened during the Cold War, NASA spending reached 4.5% of federal budget. 

2. NO to monopoly. National security shit is not allowed to have a monopoly. Spacex will never be the only player. And it's valued at 200 bil, almost 50x what rklb is worth.

3. The huge TAM of space services in general. Lunar exploration, mars, LEO sats, spy sats, LEO experimental medicine, low gravity manufacturing etc. A lot of it is speculative you say? Well that's what investing in tech is about aye? You're looking for the NEXT BIG THING, not the last big thing. You might as well do GEICO and Coca Cola if you're of that bent. 

4. Actual working rocket and workable path to another big ass rocket. How many other companies you know put their money where their mouth is and can execute to a high level. Shit, even bezos is fking up with blue origin. I have more confidence in someone who has actually made a rocket fly, than some shit that's still on the pad. 

5. A good underpromise over deliver CEO. Sir Beck doesn't shoot his mouth off. Wanna know what that means? It means if he's anything like Musk, share price would be a multiple of what it is with hype. And I'm all for execute first hype later. 

6. Improving macro environment. Last time we had a massive reduction in rates after 08, there's a boom for 10 years. 2011 to 2021 were some of the best times in the market. Now with lower rates, you bet your ass the rotation into small and mid caps is gonna happen. Not least because lower rates make capital raising and debt obligations a lot more manageable.

What are your counter arguments in support to holding RKLB long term (well beyond Neturon & profitability milestones)?

RKLB has high variance in possible outcomes in terms of return, hence by Jensen's inequality it must be overpriced currently.

RKLB is clearly in technological revolution category and while it may rise a lot in the near future, once it integrates into the economy and shifts from idiosyncratic to system risk, it may all deflate in the end.

RKLB_posts.csv,Cash and equivalents after reaching $8.04,"Thanks to u/wfriedma for the reminder, that with the price over $8.04, the capped calls Rocket Lab purchased a while ago should now be relevant again.

This is all from memory, and from my understanding of things, so take it with a grain of salt, but I think the current share price should now mean that Rocket Lab has about $700 million in cash and equivalents (rather than the ~$500 million they had at the end of Q2).

This is because the convertible notes that Rocket Lab issued were for about 69 million shares with a conversion price of $5.13. So that was to raise about $350 million dollars, that they will eventually have to settle either with cash or the 69 million shares (or some combination of the two).

To try to reduce the possibility of the full amount of dilution needing to happen to settle/redeem the notes, Rocket Lab also bought call options capped at $8.04.

The idea with those call options was that they would allow Rocket Lab to settle the convertible notes entirely with cash, without needing to pay more than the original ~$350 million principal amount, and without needing to issue any shares, up to the point of the share price being $8.04. Any higher than that and they'd need to either issue shares as well to completely settle the notes, or pay more cash beyond the original ~$350 million plus the proceeds from the call options.

In other words, the point of the capped calls was to allow Rocket Lab to pay back ""for free"" to the holders of the notes the difference between $5.13 and $8.04 per share for ~69 million shares (obviously not actually for free, the capped calls cost something like $50 million), if the share price happened to be at $8.04 when the notes were due.

So by my understanding, that works out to a maximum of about $200 million in proceeds from the capped calls, which should have been available to Rocket Lab as soon as the share price was above $8.04, i.e. today.

Saying that ~$200 million will now be added to their balance sheet is not taking into account whatever value the calls had on their balance sheet at the end of Q2 though, so I would expect my $200 million number here could be a bit too high, but it should be in the ballpark.

But the main point is, Rocket Lab should be in a significantly better cash position now, because of this latest surge in the share price.",30,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fpih3t/cash_and_equivalents_after_reaching_804/,0.9965,0.156,0.844,0.0

RKLB_posts.csv,Anyone here holding LUNR and RDW aswell as RKLB?,"I‚Äôve finally pulled the trigger and put some money in the space stocks, and I‚Äôve gone for RKLB, LUNR and RDW, with RKLB being the biggest holding of the 3.

My train of thought was, the more these companies grow and develop, get more cash behind them, capture more share of the growing space market etc, that these 3 combined will be absolutely raking the contracts in. RKLB for launch and end to end space services, Redwire for development and construction of higher end speciality space tech (their space 3d printing will be a huge bread winner imo, and then all their general high quality infrastructure like their solar cells, robotic arms, cameras, sensors, RF transmitters, in space manufacturing, their space greenhouses etc), and LUNR could/will be the go to company for getting your things on to the moon surface which is essential and they‚Äôre one of the only ones offering actual payload delivery to the moon surface (can‚Äôt see many commercial avenues for this currently but now space is more accessible than ever, I predict that america will want to have some amount of control over the moon surface, before China gets there first, I‚Äôd imagine establishing moon dominance will become a bit of a strategic/geopolitical thing)

Obviously this is all wildly speculative and a very, very high risk play. But in the long run (im thinking 15 years +), if these 3 are still around by that point, they‚Äôll be space giants and there‚Äôll always be one of the three receiving a contract for something. Obviously spacex will be hoovering up contracts too, but I still think that in the long term, these 3 will be consistentently winning more and more contracts and are probably positioned to be giants in the market when it inevitably consolidates.

3 Millionaire-Maker Space Stocks

Historically, space exploration and putting satellites into orbit has been within the purview of government-funded agencies like NASA.

That's changing, though. For-profit corporations can handle this work at least as cost-effectively as government-run organizations can. Elon Musk's SpaceX recently facilitated the world's first-ever private citizen spacewalk, for example, while Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is mainstreaming space tourism. Blue Origin's newest rocket will even soon be launching two Mars probes for NASA.

This is only the beginning of privatized work in outer space, now that technology not only allows for it, but necessitates it. Market research outfits Polaris and Precedence agree that launch services alone will be roughly a $50 billion-per-year business within a decade. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley and Citi both predict that the entirety of the science, technology, and services businesses linked to space will be worth on the order of $1 trillion by 2040.

Connect the dots. There's real investment opportunity here.

The top opportunities, however, aren't likely to be the obvious names. The potential millionaire-making space stocks are likely to be the lower-profile stocks that could even be considered a little off the radar. Here's a closer look at three of your better bets among such prospects.



Rocket Lab USA

It may not be a household name, but Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ: RKLB) has been very busy for quite some time now. Since its very first launch in May 2017, this company has put over 190 satellites into orbit. Its technology (like software, solar panels, radios, etc.) is also found inside more than 1,700 different satellites, as well as the James Webb Space Telescope. The two aforementioned Mars probes will also be flying with Rocket Lab tech on board.

While there's a clear market for satellite launches, Rocket Lab's been at it for a while. For any ticker to offer real millionaire-making potential, the company must mostly be undiscovered. That, or it needs to be doing something new that most investors don't yet fully appreciate. In this case it's the latter.

To date, all of this company's launches have utilized its so-called Electron rocket. It's perfectly fine for putting small satellites into orbit, but it's not powerful enough to lift larger satellites, exploration craft, or people into space.

That's coming, though. The Neutron rocket expected to start flying next year will be a so-called medium-lift vehicle capable of carrying bigger machinery. In fact, it will even be able to provide the initial liftoff for missions to Mars and Venus. The Neutron rocket will also be reusable, making it cost-effective for the company as well as its customers. Perhaps most important, the soon-to-launch Neutron rocket will provide real competition to SpaceX, which currently dominates the medium-lift market.

And interest is definitely firming up even before its first commercial flight. The U.S. Space Force has already provided funding to co-develop an upper stage of Rocket Lab's Neutron rocket as part of the Department of Defense's efforts to ensure it's able to secure and defend the United States wherever and however it needs to.



AST SpaceMobile

AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ: ASTS) isn't nearly as far along as Rocket Lab USA is on the commercialization front. In fact, the company only recently launched its first-ever commercial satellites. These certainly won't be the last, however, now that the underlying technology has been proven and perfected.

It's not an apples-to-apples comparison. Whereas Rocket Lab designs tech for others' satellites as well as a means of putting them into orbit, as the name implies, AST SpaceMobile offers mobile broadband connectivity via satellites rather than cellphone towers. This tech is capable of connecting anyone to the worldwide web regardless of where they are -- no physical infrastructure (other than a functioning, web-capable phone) required.

At first blush, it seems like a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. You likely don't have any trouble connecting to the web, whether that be with your phone or a computer. That's not necessarily the norm, however, and that line of thinking underestimates a growing challenge.

See, as the world becomes increasingly connected -- including our cars -- our telecom infrastructure is being pushed to its limits. Much of the developed world is now running low on radio frequencies to assign to mobile phones and cell towers. Offloading this data traffic to fiberoptic connections has certainly helped, but handling such constant switchovers en masse can be technically complex as well, and still won't fully meet future needs.

There's also the not-so-small matter that such connectivity frameworks are vulnerable to power outages and other sorts of disruption.

Satellite-based connectivity, however, sidesteps many of those problems. It's not exactly a new idea, either. Even if not always practical or affordable for the average consumer, satellite-driven mobile phone connectivity has been around since the 90s.

Now that it's practical as well as affordable, Polaris Market Research believes this market is poised to grow at an average annual pace of 18% through 2032. AST SpaceMobile is smack-dab in the middle of this mainstreaming movement.


Intuitive Machines

Last but not least, add Intuitive Machines (NASDAQ: LUNR) to your list of space-related stocks that could turn out to be millionaire makers.

In some ways, Intuitive Machines is the riskiest of the three stocks in question simply due to its small size and young age. Its market capitalization is a mere $375 million, and while it's now producing annual revenue in the same ballpark following its founding in 2013, it's also still operating in the red with only a little over $30 million worth of cash in the bank.

In other ways, though, Intuitive Machines is arguably the least risky of these three stocks just because it's also operating the most practical, currently marketable business. Simply put, this company is helping for-profit organizations and government agencies get back to the Moon. Whether that's drones that land on the Moon to map it or a means of putting communication satellites in a lunar orbit, Intuitive Machines has a solution.

It's prescient, too, given that the Moon has moved back into focus as the world's next space-exploration point of interest, perhaps as a place to mine or colonize, or perhaps as a test run for a manned mission to Mars.

Indeed, NASA's Artemis rocket designed specifically to return mankind to the Moon is still slated to do so sometime in the latter part of 2025 or 2026. This voyage will partially be made possible with the help Intuitive Machines has already provided and will provide in the future. The company recently announced a $117 million contract to deliver six different payloads to the Moon for NASA.

This is still just the beginning. Analysts believe growing interest in Moon trips will drive enough revenue growth for Intuitive Machines to push it out of the red and into the black by 2026. Reaching that milestone could easily send this stock on a rocket ride, so to speak.

If Musk had just kept the problem to X, it would probably be fine but now he is using Starlink to defy the Brazilian Government.  I know that their government involved Starlink first but instead of backing down he is doubling down.  This could have long term ramifications if worldwide governments think Musk has no respect for their laws and start to put laws in place to limit his power in their countries.  I can guarantee these discussions are happening.

RKLB_posts.csv,Rocket Lab Owns 2/3 of the U.S. Launch Market -- That Isn't SpaceX,"https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/rocket-lab-owns-2-3-120000860.html

When Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB) reported second-quarter earnings last week, it ignited a multiday rally that sent its stock price soaring as much as 18%. And no wonder.

Sales at the small space rocket manufacturer soared 71% year over year, beating analyst forecasts. The per-share loss for the quarter was $0.08 -- not great -- but still better than the $0.10 loss that Wall Street forecast.

A historic quarter

In fact, Chief Executive Officer Peter Beck said Q2 was Rocket Lab's ""highest revenue quarter in company history"" -- no great surprise given that each succeeding quarter shows revenue growth. But Beck also said that Rocket Lab is seeing ""strong and growing demand for our launch services and space systems products,"" such as the Electron rocket, Photon kick stage spacecraft, and satellites built for the U.S. Space Force. The company is also making progress on new products to power profit in the future.

First and foremost among these are the new Neutron rocket, a medium-lift rocket that, in a unique twist on traditional design, encapsulates its second stage within a reusable first stage with an integrated (and also reusable) payload fairing.

In last week's press release, Rocket Lab highlighted the recent successful first hot fire test of the Archimedes engine, nine of which will be used to power Neutron's first stage. Four days later, Rocket Lab posted a ""how it started, how it's going"" photo comparison on X first showing CEO Beck standing next to a mockup of the then-just-announced Neutron concept vehicle, side by side with a completed half-fairing for a real-life Neutron rocket.

What's more, just one day earlier, Rocket Lab announced its 10th mission so far this year, the launch of a Capella Space satellite to orbit atop an Electron rocket. Crucially, this was the first launch for Capella since September 2023, when an anomaly in an Electron rocket's second stage resulted in a loss of the payload. The fact that Capella maintained its faith in Rocket Lab -- and that faith was vindicated with a successful launch over the weekend -- has to come as happy news for Rocket Lab shareholders.

SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and ULA -- in that order

So yes, it's been a busy few days for Rocket Lab, and jam-packed with good news. Now here's some less good news.

According to Beck, Rocket Lab's Electron has become ""the most frequently launched small rocket globally."" And so far this year, Rocket Lab is responsible for ""64% of all non-SpaceX orbital U.S. launches in 2024 to date."" That sounds impressive, but it comes with a big caveat. SpaceX orbital U.S. launches already number 79 (and probably more by the time this article publishes). Meanwhile, Rocket Lab's 64% amounts to only 10 launches total.

That actually gives you a better idea of the distance between No. 2 rocket launcher Rocket Lab and No. 3 United Launch Alliance (ULA has launched four times this year, making up about 28% of non-SpaceX orbital U.S. launches), than of how close Rocket Lab is to overtaking SpaceX.

Hint: It's not even close. For the foreseeable future, the great American space race is going to remain with SpaceX as No. 1, then a big gap with everybody else.

The race for No. 2

Investors also need to be aware that Rocket Lab faces some serious competition even in the race to remain No. 2 to SpaceX.

Don't get me wrong. Rocket Lab is accelerating its launch cadence. Its revenue is accelerating. And there's a very real chance Rocket Lab will turn profitable in the next year or two. Still, now that United Launch Alliance has its new Vulcan rocket operational, it's moving quickly to regain its traditional role as one of America's leading launch companies. As I pointed out earlier this month, ULA currently has 23 Vulcan rockets in various stages of construction, and ULA CEO Tory Bruno is promising investors he will launch 20 times next year, and 25 times in 2026.

With 10 launches under its belt already in 2024, and more on the way, Rocket Lab could still out-launch ULA, and remain America's No. 2 launch provider in the future. But ULA is definitely going to try and give Rocket Lab a run for its money.",152,13,https://i.redd.it/h1c1fwpaemkd1.jpeg,0.9969,0.137,0.803,0.06

RKLB_posts.csv,FAQ for RKLB For new WSB people (fixed) thanks chatGPT,"**What do they sell?**  
Rockets, satellites, hardware, and software.

**How were they listed?**  
SPAC. They had a peak at $18.

**Who is the CEO?**  
Sir Peter Beck.

**Wait, the CEO is knighted?**  
Yes, he's a New Zealander.

**Wait, the CEO of a significant aerospace company is a New Zealander?**  
Yeah, that's why it's unusual. It shows his intelligence in achieving something no one expected.

**Who are their competitors?**  
SpaceX, Blue Origin, Firefly, Stoke, and technically Astra.

**Wait, I only know two of those.**  
Two have never launched, and two haven't launched for ages.

**Wait, didn't one of those companies also get listed and then delisted?**  
Astra did that, and Virgin Orbit too, until they filed for Chapter 11.

**Ok, cool. What are Rocket Lab's competitive advantages over SpaceX and Blue Origin?**  
With Electron, smaller satellites that need to be launched sooner and to closer locations can be cheaper and more profitable over time compared to delays.

**Wait, why does their revenue recognition change so often over quarters?**  
Revenue for launches can only be recognized at launch, with 90% paid by launch day.

**How many launches are needed on Electron per year to be profitable?**  
Around 21.

**Wait, they didn‚Äôt launch that many per year.**  
First, consider revenue recognition. Delays are primarily on the client side.

**What is Neutron?**  
A significant new rocket that can lift up to 13 metric tons.

**How much does R&D for this cost?**  
It's supposed to be around $300 million. It might cost more.

RKLB_posts.csv,What many people miss about Rocket Lab,"I have seen a lot of posts on here and WSB that only discuss the launch side of Rocket Lab.

Rocket Lab is not just a launch company. They are way more than that. They are an end to end space company.

Take a look at these scenarios below.

Company X( basically all companies that need something in space to operate. Use ASTS for example): These companies design and build something that operates in space, but rely on another company to get their equipment there.

SpaceX: launch provider with an emphasis on launching their own constellation with further goals in space. We all know they can launch themselves.

Rocket Lab: started as a launch only company with Electron but have heavily diversified their business into space systems. Their business offers the ability to design, build, launch and operate a customers satellites or space craft or maybe their own constellation someday. This is why it is called end to end. Their business is not launch, launch is only one of their tools to more effectively do business in space. Neutron will not make or break this company. They do not rely in its success to make them profitable. They could stop development today and still be profitable in the future due to the way they have positioned themselves in the industry through their space system business segments. This type of position is going to be huge in the future as more people move their business into space.

I have followed this company for 3 years and they continue to impress me. Though launch is a very exciting part of this business, since it is really the only one we can see, I encourage every investor here to start viewing this company as an all around space company instead of just a launch company.

RKLB_posts.csv,Rocket Lab Acquisition / Constellation Analysis,"# Hey r/RKLB, just wanted to share some analysis I've been doing on potential acquisition targets.

Rocket Lab's track record with acquisitions follows a fairly well-defined pattern. Let's take a look at the companies they have purchased thus far:

* **SolAero Technologies** - $80m - Dec '21 - Provider of high performance solar panels - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-space-solar-power-products-company-solaero-holdings-inc/)
* **Planetary System Corp (PSC)** - $42m + 1.7m shares - Dec '21 - Provider of separation systems - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-space-hardware-company-planetary-systems-corporation/)
* **Advanced Solutions Inc (ASI)** - $40m - Oct '21 - Flight software, mission sim, and guidance + nav software - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-acquires-space-software-company-advanced-solutions-inc/)
* **Sinclair Interplanetary** - $ Unknown - Apr - '20 - Satellite components (reaction wheels, star trackers, etc) - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-satellite-hardware-manufacturer-sinclair-interplanetary/)

Here is a section of an interview with CEO Peter Beck explaining the methodology behind Rocket Lab's acquisitions: [https://youtu.be/T\_\_1ubfs\_iE?t=1313](https://youtu.be/T__1ubfs_iE?t=1313)

* ""If the supply chain can not provide us the surety to deliver what we need, then we‚Äôll go and vertically integrate""
* ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs too expensive and it‚Äôs too slow, generally we need to own it because we can make it cheaper and faster‚Äù
* ""Is this going to be strategically important to us in the future for stuff that we think we're going to do""

To summarize, Rocket Lab's acquisitions have all been vertical integration plays; bringing some aspect of their supply chain in house to either reduce lead times, unit cost, or both. Peter has mentioned in multiple interviews that all of these companies have scaled and integrated successfully into Rocket Lab's business.

Note how most of these acquisitions support the production and manufacturing of satellite **buses**. A quick review: satellites can be described as being comprised of a **bus** and a **payload.**

**Bus** - the main structure and infrastructure of a satellite, providing the necessary support systems for the payload to operate effectively. It includes power, structure, solar panels, propulsion, thermal control, attitude control, communication, and on-board computer systems.

**Payload** - the primary instrumentation or equipment on a satellite that performs the specific mission or function, such as sensing, communication, or experimentation, and is the reason the satellite is launched into space.  
  

Rocket Lab can currently produce satellite buses quickly, cost effectively, and at scale. Payloads? Not so much. 

# I think Rocket Lab's next acquisition will be a payload company. A company that specializes communications equipment, imaging/sensors, etc.

It's been clearly communicated by leadership that Rocket Lab plans on building a LEO constellation. If/when they do announce an acquisition of a payload company, we will be able to make some pretty big assumptions about the type of constellation they will build.

I do not think Rocket Lab will build out a direct to consumer mega constellation a la Starlink or Kuiper based on the following:

* Starlink's original estimated cost to design, build and deploy was $10 Billion  [source](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/05/block-5-spacex-increase-launch-cadence-lower-prices/)
* Amazon reportedly invested $10 Billion in the Kuiper project in 2020 [source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/fcc-authorizes-amazon-to-build-kuiper-satellite-internet-network.html)
* Comments from CFO Adam Spice :

>""the broadband from space application that SpaceX targeted with Starlink, that's probably not what we will be going for just given the amount of capital required"" [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=1059)

>""but there's lots of very interesting applications that required dozens or hundreds of satellites not 40 thousand satellites"" [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=1070)

While it's possible they could pursue a smaller 5G constellation similar to AST SpaceMobile, I think AST's tech moat is wide enough that other opportunities make more sense.

# I think it's likely that we see a smaller 100-200 satellite constellation purpose built and marketed towards military applications.

These satellites could provide access to a suite of sensors, communication systems, radar, antennas, etc., and deliver tailored services to DoD customers. A few points supporting that:

* Rocket Lab is prime DoD contractor as of Dec '23, acting as prime for the $515m SDA Tranche 2 Transport Layer - Beta contract. According to Adam Spice this:

>""opens up a lot of opportunities for us"" .. ""we think it's a huge enabler to grow that government exposure"".  [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=515)

* Sitting Board member Nina Armagno, among many other things, **was the first director of staff of the United States Space Force** and was responsible for helping to establish the organizational framework, policies and procedures, building relationships with other branches, etc.  [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/about/team/)
* The business is already heavily focused on gov customers. SDA, ESCAPADE, HASTE, CAPSTONE, TROPICS, etc, all make up a huge chunk of rocket lab's revenue already.

# Ok. So if it's likely that the acquisition is a payload company, and it's likely that the payload would be for a constellation built for servicing DoD customers, I think I know where to look...

# [Here is a list of subcontractors that Rocket Lab selected to help fulfill the SDA contract](https://spaceimpulse.com/2024/05/07/rocket-lab-selects-subcontractors-for-sda-satellite-constellation/#:~:text=The%20selected%20subcontractors%20include%20CesiumAstro,Redwire%20Space%2C%20and%20Parsons%20Corporation)

What do you know, a bunch of **payload** companies (mostly).

* **CesiumAstro** - $260-390m [source](https://app.dealroom.co/companies/cesiumastro) - will provide its Vireo active electronically scanned array (AESA) radio frequency (RF) communications payload, known as the first multi-beam-capable Ka-band communications system for SDA‚Äôs PWSA.
* **Mynaric** - $93m Mkt Cap - will supply CONDOR Mk3 optical communication terminals, enhancing free space optical communications for air, space, and mobile applications.
* **Redwire Space** - 450m Mkt Cap - has been chosen for its expertise in antennas and RF hardware.
* **Parsons Corp** - 10b Mkt Cap - will provide the NEBULA Operations ‚Äì Vendor Architecture (NOVA), serving as Rocket Lab‚Äôs ground system for the operational management of its 18 satellites.
* **SEAKR Engineering** - Acquired by Raytheon - will offer its Tactical Satellite Communications (TACSATCOM) Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Network Encryption System (NES).
* **Collins Aerospace** - Acquired by Safran Group - ¬†is set to deliver the waveform necessary for the SDR, essential software and firmware for TACSATCOM‚Äôs transmission and reception.

# Cash Situation

Rocket Lab's current Cash and Equivalents and marketable securities etc is $546.8m ([source - slide 37](https://s28.q4cdn.com/737637457/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/FINAL-Rocket-Lab-Q2-2024-Earnings-Presentation.pdf))

All the previous acquisitions have been in the $40-80m range (Sinclair likely less)

Adam Spice gave guidance in the Q2 '24 earnings call that capex for Neutron R&D was expected to tick up in the in the second half of 2024 [source](https://youtu.be/lE9SPN_bIhc?t=3634)

Adam Spice on whether they would do another cap raise - ""Right now we don't see anything that would cause us to go back to capital markets"" but did provide a caveat that for the right opportunity, it's a possibility [source](https://youtu.be/lE9SPN_bIhc?t=5751)

So it's not likely they would raise capital for an acquisition, but it's also not off the table.

Obviously the last three subcontractors on the list aren't an option, and $450m for Redwire seems a bit steep given the cash on hand. **Mynaric** and **CesiumAstro** both fit the profile and around the price range we are looking for.

Do I think one of these companies will be acquired by Rocket Lab? **I don't know**.

Do I think a company *like* Mynaric or CesiumAstro will be acquired by Rocket Lab? **Yes.**

Here's a few predictions:

* I think the first constellation Rocket Lab builds will be less than 200 satellites
* I think it will be purpose built to serve the DoD, possibly partnering with a branch to actually fund the first tranche of satellites
* If there is an acquisition, I feel very confident that it will be a payload company
* Without a cap raise, I think $100m is the most we could afford to spend on an acquisition (assuming no Neutron delays etc)

RKLB_posts.csv,Everyday Astronaut video about New Glenn,"This post is actually about Rocket Lab & Neutron, not a Blue Origin advertisement.

I really highly recommend watching Everyday Astronaut‚Äôs latest YouTube video with Jeff Bezos & New Glenn Factory. It confirmed three things I‚Äôve personally thought are Rocket Labs clear advantages with Neutron.

1. Carbon composite gives you best performance and is clearly the best material choice. Downside to this is iterating the rocket design is not realistic so you have to get it right with the first design. Rocket Lab already did exactly this with Electron.

2. Reusable fairings attached to the 1st stage are an excellent idea to reduce cost.

3. If you can make the 2nd stage cheap enough, you will never have to deal with the problems that a reusable 2nd stage will have. Blue Origin is also attempting this. They‚Äôre (in parallel) designing a reusable 2nd stage and another ‚Äùas cheap as possible‚Äù expendable 2nd stage. Bezos said if they can make the expendable 2nd stage very cheap, then it doesn‚Äôt make economical sense to attempt to reuse it. 

What are these 2nd stage problems I mentioned? Look at what Starship has to deal with on re-entry. Combine that with the extra weight of the stainless steel, fuel, heat shielding that is required to make it reusable. That‚Äôs weight that could be used to deliver extra payload to orbit. (I know I know, Starship is designed for interplanetary travel etc. so re-entry is a requirement)

Rocket Lab is purely going for a 2nd stage that is as cheap and as light as possible. I think this will prove to be the right choice. There‚Äôs a lot of reasons why and are mostly related to economics and performance of the overall vehicle.

For example the empty weight for the 2nd stage of a Falcon 9 is 3900kg. Peter Beck has stated the 2nd stage of Neutron is roughly the same weight as a Harley Davidson motorcycle so around 300-400kg. That‚Äôs a big difference.

After watching the video I have a lot more respect for Jeff Bezos & Blue Origin. On a related note, Blue Origin is scheduled to launch two spacecraft built by Rocket Lab to Mars next month (unless there‚Äôs a delay)",49,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1eufya5/everyday_astronaut_video_about_new_glenn/,0.9506,0.07,0.899,0.031
RKLB_posts.csv,Simple DD for Newcomers.,"RKLB builds satellites and rockets currently it has operational Electron small launch rocket with over 50 launches. They are working on a big rocket called Neutron which will be Reusable. As well as a suite of various satellites.

What is a reusable rocket and why is it important?

Most rockets ever to exist have been expendable, meaning they get destroyed or become museum peices. Imagine the cost of an airplane ticket if you had to build a 747 airplane fly across the world and trash the 747 every time. That's basically what humanity did until SpaceX proved it was possible to land rockets with Falcon 9. The concept has been proven. Rocket Lab along with a few others are chasing this dream. Since SpaceX landed Falcon 9 and became reusable no one has been able to duplicate this and the company is now worth 210 billion market cap, they are in first place a huge leap ahead of everyone.

Furthermore, Rocket Lab builds the satellites for many of the launches, satellite components and has a huge space systems division and sells a service, which means they scoop up way more profit margin. They are far ahead all others (excluding SpaceX) and plan to launch the first Neutron mid 2025 and will become profitable shortly after. 

Neutron will be designed to be reusable from day 1 where Falcon 9 was not which will give them a big advantage in design. 

RKLB is only valued around 3.2 billion to SpaceXs 210 billion. Pennies on the dollar and most agree it is wildly undervalued right now. 

So, proof of concept has been established by SpaceX, Rocket Lab has tons of space and launch experience with their Electron Rocket being the second most frequently launched rocket. They have hundreds of millions in cash reserves to finish the development, the Archimedes engine that powers Neutron has just fired up for the first time recently after 3 yesrs of hard work and engines are the longest lead time in building a rocket. No other company is in a more perfect position to become and remain the #2 space company in the world. Once Neutron is successful and launching, this company should easily be worth 20-50 billion dollars ($45-$100 stock price) fair value still a fraction of SpaceX, they will be able to launch their own mega satellite constellations.

The CEO and Founder Peter Beck is an absolute genius, self taught rocket scientist and has been regarded as such by many influential people in the industry.

The meme potential is fun and could be nice, the fundamental potential... the sky is the limit.

RKLB_posts.csv,Will RKLB's share price double this year? - Re-revisiting my post from 2024/04/29,"Today, on 2024/08/16, RKLB reached $7.10, more than doubling from its YTD low of $3.47 on 2024/04/16. Hell yeah!

  
[My old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cfjtco/will_rklbs_share_price_double_this_year/)¬†from 2024/04/29 follows below:

RKLB share price has a history of doubling from its low during the summer and then falling down to repeat the process next year. So far, it has happened every and each year since its listing on the stock market:

* **2021: $9.5 to $21.34 from 2021/08/27 to 2021/09/09**
* **2022: $3.53 to $7.15 from 2022/06/30 to 2022/08/12**
* **2023:**¬†**$3.76 to $8.05 from 2023/05/09 to 2023/07/19**

The 2024 low has been reached on 2024/4/16 at $3.47. What has changed from previous years besides the company's increased performance is that¬†**the reported short interest YTD has increased by 161% from 22m to 58m shorted shares**. This huge increase right before the summer may cause a bound of a violent volatility once the 2024 doubling commences.

RKLB trades so cheaply and it is so heavily shorted that all that may be needed to revalue its stock is a shift in sentiment. Right now the stock is pricing in the most bearish of bearish outcomes. Delayed Neutron development, increased R&D costs and Electron's obsolescence. But Rocket Lab is the only space company dedicated to being a one stop shop for space applications. Suppose over this year, the management can craft a narrative that Neutron is really coming this year/early next year and with it a significant decrease in R&D costs and the growth and capture of launch and space system markets. Such sentiment shift may take time but I don't know, there are so many unusual factors with Rocket Lab that I could see it happening rapidly.

I am not betting that Rocket Lab is going to stage the most epic growth of all time. I am just betting on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06).
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year.

RKLB_posts.csv,Peter Beck and Rocket Lab have an opportunity‚Ä¶and seem to be playing it right.,"This isn‚Äôt to get too political‚Ä¶it‚Äôs about business but also how politics plays an important role in the success of space focused companies.  Everyone here knows that Space X is the current leader in the industry.  They have a solid infrastructure, some good engineers, and have done a great job so far.  They got an early lead and were well on their way to being the leader for decades to come.  Something similar could be said for Tesla.  However, in the early stages in a new industry, big mistakes can be extremely costly.  In the case of Tesla, the focus on the cybertruck and electric semi‚Äôs has cost a fair amount of Cap ex and no revenue.  Cybertrucks are sitting on lots and in fields and if you follow the Reddit r/cyberstuck you can see that they are basically hot garbage.  Teslas were incredibly successful at first but the constant price decreases and increases have turned some people off from buying again.  On top of that, and more importantly, Musk himself has alienated his largest consumer base with his anti-California, anti-lgbtq, etc‚Ä¶nonsense.  If there is one thing most successful CEOs will say is keep your loyal customers happy.  Tesla‚Äôs share of EV sales has dropped from 75% in 2022 to just under 50% in 2024.  

But, this is about Rocket Lab.  Space companies are going to continue to rely on government contracts along with the private sector.  For U.S. contracts, the company has to be based in the U.S. and meet specific security requirements.  There are only a couple of companies that can do that.  Over the next decade, the space industry should see phenomenal growth.  One company will not provide all the services.  The contracts will be split between multiple companies.  When it comes time to award those contracts, ability and consistency will play a huge role and also reputation.  Beck has done a fantastic job of being politically neutral.  He just gets the job done.  Musk on the other hand has decided to back one horse whole-heartedly and there will be a price to pay for that.  If his candidate loses, along with the trepidation congress already feels about how much power and influence he already has, it could be an opportunity for Rocket Lab to grow with huge contracts.  They just have to get Neutron to be successful.  If Kuniper turns out to have better technology then Starlink and if ASTS technology takes market share since a lot of people just want their phone to work in remote areas and not carry around an entire dish, then that could slow Starlink growth.  Space X will continue to be successful due to Starship but they are not guaranteed the top spot forever now.

Rocket Lab Stock Soars. Space Has Momentum.

Commercial space company Rocket Lab RKLB 12.58% posted stronger quarterly sales Thursday evening, sending shares soaring. Rocket Lab, like Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX, has space launch and satellite-building capabilities. SpaceX, of course, is dominant, launching almost 80 times so far in 2024. Rocket Lab has launched nine times. Investors don‚Äôt get regular quarterly updates from Musk‚Äôs privately held space company. That isn‚Äôt the case with publicly traded Rocket Lab. For the second quarter, Rocket Lab reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, of negative $21 million from sales of just over $106 million. Wall Street was looking for an Ebitda loss of $26 million from sales of just under $106 million. Better cost control, resulting in a smaller-than-expected loss, is a positive. So are higher sales. Rocket Lab‚Äôs second-quarter sales grew about 15% compared with the first quarter and more than 70% year over year. The results sent Rocket Lab shares up about 12.6% in Friday trading to $5.37 apiece. The S&P 500 SPX 0.47% and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA 0.13% gained 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively. Following the report, Stifel analyst Erik Rasmussen wrote that launch demand remains strong and that sales should jump higher in the fourth quarter following relatively flat third-quarter sales of between $100 and $105 million. Rasmussen projects $121 million in fourth-quarter sales, up more than 100% year over year. He projects 2025 sales of about $576 million, up 36% from expected 2024 sales. Rasmussen projects positive Ebitda for the company in 2026, after sales hit almost $1 billion. He rates Rocket Lab shares Buy and has a $9 price target for the stock. Through Friday trading, Rocket Lab shares were down about 4% year to date.Shares of space start-up Virgin Galactic SPCE 2.16% are down about 87% this year, despite a 14% jump on Thursday. The company reported second-quarter sales of $4.2 million on Wednesday evening. Wall Street was looking for $3.4 million. Galactic focuses, of course, on space tourism. While better-than-expected sales are positive, ramping up capacity has been harder than the company expected. Rocket Lab has had more success providing launch services for companies looking to deploy small satellites into low-earth orbit. Coming into Friday trading, Galactic‚Äôs market capitalization was below $200 million. Rocket Lab‚Äôs was north of $2.3 billion. SpaceX dwarfs them both.

Rocket Lab had another successful launch this morning.   Just watched them successfully deploy the Capella satellite.  I think we see $10 by the end of the year.  I also think there might be more consolidation in the space industry.  Everyone knows that to compete with Musk you have to grow as fast as possible.  I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see more U.S. government contracts announced for Rocket Lab.  Boeing has really dropped the ball with leaving the astronauts stuck in space.  They are not getting any contracts until they bring them home unless one of their paid servants in congress really pushes for more money for Boeing.  If two of the big companies don‚Äôt combine in the next 12 months I‚Äôll be surprised.  ",97,48,https://i.redd.it/rgqb4oh2o1id1.jpeg,0.9891,0.099,0.87,0.032
RKLB_posts.csv,"Manifest Space interview with Andy Lapsa, Stoke Space CEO (2024-07-25)","As another up and coming potential competitor to Rocket Lab, I thought people might find this interview from a couple of weeks ago worth listening to:

https://open.spotify.com/episode/3IpviNvEIcPEIQr6mrFIoB?si=IDhsKoiHR8mzJ0HN1i7r_Q

Given Stoke are aiming to be a launch only company at this point, I don't think the threat from these guys is too much at this point in time, although Andy did make a comment in the interview that I took as a bit of a sign that they're aiming to progress beyond launch, once they've got launch itself nailed down.

For those who don't know, Stoke are the company aiming to create a fully and rapidly reusable medium lift rocket (on the lower side of medium lift) called Nova. That might sound unlikely for a startup to achieve, but I've got a huge amount of respect for this company and the founders already.

First of all because they just sound like they know what they're doing, but also and probably more importantly because:

- They've already built and started testing a full flow staged combustion cycle engine in just a couple of years since first funding (an insane achievement)
- They've got an actual (and innovative) plan for how to make their second stage reusable, with a novel engine and actively cooled heatshield design
- On top of that they've also been testing development hardware already (doing hop tests) for that second stage

They are privately funded, not a public company to invest in, but I definitely think they're one to keep an eye on, if for no other reason than to keep an eye on as a Rocket Lab competitor (though they seem to be doing an awesome enough job that I'm just interested in seeing what they do anyway).

They aim for first launch at the end of 2025, so around the same time as Neutron.",34,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1ep33m5/manifest_space_interview_with_andy_lapsa_stoke/,0.9885,0.137,0.839,0.024

RKLB_posts.csv,First time RKLB has ever reported a net increase in Current Assets,"I'm sure a good amount of you caught this, but in all the excitement around record revenue/growth, the successful hot fire, the neutron infrastructure updates, etc, I missed something.

As far as I'm aware Rocket lab has never posted a quarterly net increase in total current assets **(obviously not counting the capital raise in February).**

Except they did last quarter. This really surprised me, I expected to see a similar quarter over quarter decrease typical to any quarter since the SPAC merger.

Total current assets as well as cash & equivalents + marketable securities combined are slightly higher this quarter than last.

Is this the start of a trend? I'm skeptical for now. CFO Adam Spice mentioned an increase in capex through the next 3-4 quarters tapering off in Q2 '25 as the first neutron launch approaches. That mixed with the lower expected launch revenue in Q3, I wouldn't be too surprised to see the downtrend resume, at least in the near term.

I still found this encouraging and thought it was worth a share.

RKLB_posts.csv,The SPAC = bad argument...,"Some people argue that all SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) are bad or risky investments.  
  
While they have a point, they're missing the bigger picture. SPACs offer an easy way for companies to access public markets quickly and with less scrutiny. Naturally, this path attracts some questionable companies. However, what these critics overlook is that there are solid companies that have gone public via SPACs because it was a general trend, not because they are shady.

An interesting point to note is that the median return of the entire stock market is negative, with almost every sector, from healthcare to energy, following this trend (with the exception of finance, which has a neutral median return). Only a few stocks contribute to an overall positive average return. (Source: [https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/average-is-not-the-same-as-median](https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/average-is-not-the-same-as-median))

Therefore, SPACs failing or delivering negative returns isn't extraordinary; it's the norm.   
  
Most SPACs are in a worse position than when they went public, often having attempted and failed to launch their projects since their listing. 

However, this isn't the case with RocketLab.   
When RocketLab went public via a SPAC in August 2021, they had already launched 21 times in 4 years, had an annual revenue of $60 million, and their space systems side was just getting started. Now, they launch over 15 times per year, aim for over $400 million in annual revenue, secure constellation-level contracts and $0.5 billion satellite contracts, and we can see their Neutron hardware taking shape.

-> RocketLab is in a significantly better position than when they were listed. The share price does not show it, but the company got fundamentally better.

This is not financial advice, just a few thoughts I had when I saw a graphic about median stock returns.

RKLB_posts.csv,How to accelerate Rocket Lab's growth,"Rocket Lab has correctly positioned itself as a vertically-integrated player in the rapidly growing New Space economy. From components to systems, spacecraft, constellations, and through to launch, on-orbit operations, and space-based application solutions, Rocket Lab has built up the capability to ‚Äúdo what it says it‚Äôs going to do.‚Äù More importantly, as it has built up these capabilities, it‚Äôs done so with a success rate that approaches 100%. Rocket Lab does not fail, or at least hasn‚Äôt failed so far. As Beck is heard to say in Wild Wild Space,¬†""I‚Äôm not built to build shit.‚Äù

Yet there are tradeoffs to be made between organic growth and growth gained through acquisitions. Yes, building up capabilities in-house at a place like Rocket Lab ensures that the results meet and often exceed immediate and long-term requirements. Whereas the challenges of an acquisition include cultural fit and other integration challenges as well as inevitable product evolution to meet internal requirements. The biggest expense of internal development is the opportunity cost. Though an acquisition costs actual cash, you‚Äôre buying a capability that‚Äôs closer to market already.

While Rocket Lab has¬†**capabilities**, it has limited¬†**capacity**. The New Space economy is growing so fast that Rocket Lab doesn‚Äôt have enough time to hire the number of top-flight team members needed to grow their business from the inside. But the company‚Äôs anemic market cap makes it nearly impossible to acquire top-flight technologies to keep up with requirements, opportunities, and capacity.

As I see it, there are 4 possible scenarios that will allow the company to optimize growth and fully realize its potential:

1. The market must respond to Rocket Lab‚Äôs potential to such an extent that the market cap grows by multiples.
2. An outside equity investor must be found to invest $1 billion or more to fund¬†acquisitions, but diluting existing investors in the process.
3. Rocket Lab must merge or even be acquired by another company with compatible capabilities/capacity and access to significant capital.
4. Rocket Lab can continue to grow organically with the opportunities and challenges it currently faces.

The market may give greater recognition to Rocket Lab once Neutron reaches orbit. But the stated scale up of launch cadence is incremental, spanning several years before it can deploy a constellation like the Falcon 9 is doing for StarLink. Even with a 70% annual growth rate, it‚Äôll take many years to reach the scale implied by Peter Beck‚Äôs vision.

RKLB_posts.csv,What Are Wall Street Analysts Missing in Rocket Lab's Growth Story? Morgan Stanley's analyst Kristine Tan Liwag has a 100% failure record of predicting Rocket Lab's share price,"Today, I shall discuss issues beyond Rocket Lab's control. Morgan Stanley's Kristine Tan Liwag has announced a price target of $6 for RKLB. Covering RKLB since January 2021, she has consistently given price targets that have never materialized. In my opinion, she has once again failed to consider the impact of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on the RKLB's share price (SP) but this time the upside of decrease in the FOMC rates. Let's delve into details.

Below are her price targets that I was able to find (there are more, but I believe that I captured all her predictions with SP changes from her preceding reports), the RLKB's SP at the close on the preceding business day to see where she was coming from and RKLB's SP 1 year later.

||Kristine Tan Liwag's price targets|RKLB on the preceding day|RKLB 1 year later|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2022/01/12|$17|$10.86|$4.83|
|2022/05/18|$16|$5.66|$4.65|
|2022/08/16|$12|$6.02|$5.88|
|2022/11/11|$10|$5.31|$4.33|
|2023/01/16|$10|$4.97|$4.94|
|2023/03/07|$10|$4.43|$4.43|
|2023/08/09|$10|$6.66||
|2024/05/09|$8|$4.10||
|2024/07/15|$6|$5.65||

Not once was she able to predict the price target with any accuracy despite arguably giving best questions to the CEO and CFO on earning calls. She was always more than 50% off. **Prices predicted by this analyst never (not once(!)) materialized after she made her predictions.**

How is it possible that she seems to be unable to get her finger on RKLB's price action?

Let's take a look at her professional history: ""*Kristine Liwag is an executive director at Morgan Stanley. She is the Head of Aerospace & Defense Equity Research. Prior to joining Morgan Stanley in 2020, Liwag was at Bank of America Merrill Lynch for 12 years* *in Aerospace & Defense and covered Smid-Cap Suppliers and Aircraft Lessors. She ranked Runner Up in the 2022 Institutional Investor Survey in the Aerospace & Defense category. Liwag holds a bachelor‚Äôs degree in business administration from Georgetown University in Washington, DC.*""

According to the BrokerCheck Report her employment history started in July 2008 as a Merrill Lynch's research analyst and she took her first General Industry Exams (General Securities Representative Examination) and her States Securities Law Exams (Uniform Securities Agent State Law Examination) in August 2008.

Let's take another step back and see what has happened before she started her analyst career. Since July 2004 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was steadily hiking rates, peaking at 5.24% in July 2006. In August 2007, the FOMC started to cut rates. When Kristine Tan Liwag started her career at Merrill Lynch, rates were already decreased to 2%. During her entire career until the latest hiking cycle, which started in March 2022, she did not have an opportunity to rates above 2.42% (April 2019). In the current cycle, which started in March 2022, but which was announced as far as in late November or early December 2021, the FOMC has increased rates to 5.33%, more than the double of the last cycle's peak.

She is not the only analyst out there with limited experience with the FOMC rates above 5%. Some analysts adapted better to the current FOMC rates cycle, some fared worse. As far as RKLB is concerned, she seems to be in the latter group. In her reports until the 2nd half of 2023, she seemed to ignore the effect of increased FOMC rates on RKLB. In her most recent price target of $6, she seems to ignore the effect of the upcoming decrease of FOMC rates, which will lift the RKLB's SP.

RKLB_posts.csv,Will RKLB's share price double this year? - Revisiting my post from 2024/04/29,"My old post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cfjtco/will_rklbs_share_price_double_this_year/) and I'll re-post its text below. RLKB closed that day at $3.80. Today, it closed at $5.33.

My thesis was that RKLB has doubled from lows each year since its SPAC IPO and that 2024 will be no different in this regard. I've bet on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil. - this holds true at the current valuation.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06). - this was true and we're now expecting much higher Q2 revenues (+30% QoQ) and another doubling of the backlog.
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars. - this still holds true, the demand for Electron was confirmed by the Synspective's order of 10 Electron launches and app. 7 HASTE launches between 2024 and 2025.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year. - Neutron will not launch this year but Kuiper satellites are still scheduled for the launch in the second half of this year.

My thesis is still intact. Even though it is too early to do the victory lap, RKLB is now mere 30% away from doubling since its all time lows and there are many catalysts on the horizon. For example, the upcoming Archie hot-fire test (I love that Archimedes' nickname), Ashlee Vance's Wild Wild Space documentary on HBO MAX, the common run up to the earnings report and, of course, the FOMC cutting the rates this year.

Let me know your opinion.

[My post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cfjtco/will_rklbs_share_price_double_this_year/) from 2024/04/29:

RKLB share price has a history of doubling from its low during the summer and then falling down to repeat the process next year. So far, it has happened every and each year since its listing on the stock market:

* **2021: $9.5 to $21.34 from 2021/08/27 to 2021/09/09**
* **2022: $3.53 to $7.15 from 2022/06/30 to 2022/08/12**
* **2023:**¬†**$3.76 to $8.05 from 2023/05/09 to 2023/07/19**

The 2024 low has been reached on 2024/4/16 at $3.47. What has changed from previous years besides the company's increased performance is that¬†**the reported short interest YTD has increased by 161% from 22m to 58m shorted shares**. This huge increase right before the summer may cause a bound of a violent volatility once the 2024 doubling commences.

RKLB trades so cheaply and it is so heavily shorted that all that may be needed to revalue its stock is a shift in sentiment. Right now the stock is pricing in the most bearish of bearish outcomes. Delayed Neutron development, increased R&D costs and Electron's obsolescence. But Rocket Lab is the only space company dedicated to being a one stop shop for space applications. Suppose over this year, the management can craft a narrative that Neutron is really coming this year/early next year and with it a significant decrease in R&D costs and the growth and capture of launch and space system markets. Such sentiment shift may take time but I don't know, there are so many unusual factors with Rocket Lab that I could see it happening rapidly.

I am not betting that Rocket Lab is going to stage the most epic growth of all time. I am just betting on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06).
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year.

I've noticed too that almost all of them are hungry for more shares. As time has gone on and we have traded down in this range, all of their collective research has only lead to them wanting more shares, even surpassing previous share count goals/targets. This has me extremely bullish that Creators doing a large amount of research haven't lost any hope.

With that being said, I want to give a shout out to Vince and also offer an apology. I used to be very critical of Vince, doubting his knowledge on the subject. It felt like he more yolo'ed into the stock and was being a permabull. Whether or not that was originally true or just my incorrect opinion, I think Vince has really grown his knowledge on RKLB. The sheer number of videos he puts put forces him to listen to, read, and gather information for us. I feel like the last few videos he has produced lately have also demonstrated that.

August 8 is also RKLB earnings call date, but I wouldn‚Äôt read too much into that. The Aug 8th date on the SDA contract was last updated in March.

The big $515m contract that RL won early this year was for 18 T2TL Beta satellites. I believe this was the smallest of the Beta satellite awards.

The Alpha satellites were awarded to York Space and Northrop Grumman. I don‚Äôt think RKLB was in a position to compete for these at the time.

The Beta satellites were originally awarded to Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. The Rocket Lab award was added on later.

There are only 20 Gamma satellites, and SDA apparently plans to award them to just one company. I doubt they would go with a new company, since the Gamma sats are apparently similar to Alpha and especially Beta satellites. So no real speculation here, other than that Rocket Lab for sure competed for these, and is one of 4 options SDA would likely choose.

Overall the movie is great, but not a ‚Äúrocket lab‚Äù movie. It mostly covers Astra and honestly pulls no punches when talking about their failures. It also covers Planet a good bit. After Astra‚Äôs failures it cuts back to Rocket Lab doing their thing.
Both Kemp (pictured after the movie, definitely embarrassed) and the Planet Labs CEO were both in attendance and had two rows of reserved seats for people. There were 3 Rocket Lab employees there who bought their own seats (I think this speaks volumes in a good way). Firefly wasn‚Äôt put into the movie.

Looks like SpaceX, ULA, and Blue Origin will have the privilege of competing for 5.6 billion in government contracts.  I'm surprised that Blue Origin was included in this group and Rocket Lab was left out.  As far as I understand, Blue Origin has only been to near earth orbit once. The government is even paying Blue Origin 5 million to tell them how they could help. Hmm. If anyone needed some tax dollars, it's Jeffy!

RKLB_posts.csv,Why I'm Holding till 2030 at least. My RKLB DD post.,"# Introduction

I‚Äôve been following Rocket Lab since 2019, before it SPAC-ed in 2021. Having already known the company, I aped in following the SPAC announcement in the range of $12-$15. Slowly averaged down the cost through the SPAC-pocalypse. Average price probably in the range of $8-$10 not $4.78 as I changed brokers.

[Current position \~168,000 shares. \(\~140,000 shares are mine, the rest are held for family\) Have only trimmed \~10&#37; of shares in the recent run up as part of risk management, portfolio was 100&#37; in RKLB.](https://preview.redd.it/vn1prfwdko3e1.jpg?width=1093&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af5f6ad220bd27de3e600e6edb768f1ac71a63ae)

With the increase in stock price over the last few months and the increase in newcomers asking price target questions and new posts every time it hits a new round number, people asking if they should take profit as they expect a pull back to happen, there hasn‚Äôt been a proper DD post in awhile and I feel that many are not capturing the point that Sir Peter Beck's end goal for Rocket Lab is to be an **END-TO-END Space Company.** In my opinion it will be impossible to attribute a price target for $RKLB just simply because the industry is still in its infancy stage, instead, what is important is to see just how much of the growing space industry Rocket Lab could possibly capture in the next 5-10 years.

This is my own DD post and is not financial advise, I will attempt to cover and break down Rocket Labs business segments and why I will hold be a shareholder till 2030 and beyond.

[Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, spacecraft, satellite components, and on-orbit management - 2024 Q3 Earnings Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/xjvg1d975p3e1.jpg?width=1257&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fd1ccef8c9bea2cbd8d74e37fac398b64680181)

Although in the name, Rocket Lab is not just a launch provider, but an end-to-end space company providing, not just the launch service but also complete spacecraft design, manufacturing, satellite components and on-orbit management. Eventually, the company intends to use the experience to deliver and provide their own service from space through its own **satellite constellation**.

# Business Segments

**1. Electron**

[Electron is the only reusable orbital-class small rocket. Capturing and reflying Electron‚Äôs first stage enables higher launch frequency without expanding production and lowers launch costs.](https://preview.redd.it/okycitpk5p3e1.png?width=1345&format=png&auto=webp&s=453be91a7aad8274d7fef195c42eeb1daf48add2)

Electron is a two-stage, small-lift launch vehicle that is able to carry around 300kg to Low-Earth Orbit. Its Rutherford engines are the first electric-pump-fed engine to power an orbital-class rocket. Electron is often flown with a kick stage or Rocket Lab's Photon spacecraft.¬†

Proven Reliability ‚Äì Electron has already flown 14 times this year, achieving record cadence, over the 10 times flown in 2023. Electron is now the 3rd most frequently launched rocket globally in 2024. 54 launches (50 successes, four failures \~ 92.5% success rate)

Responsiveness ‚Äì Electron can launch from three launch pads across two hemispheres, from LC1 A/B in New Zealand, Rocket Lab‚Äôs privately owned launch pad or from LC2 in Wallops, Virginia. This has been demonstrated recently with a HASTE launch in LC2 and an electron launch within 24 hours on Nov 24/25.

[üöÄ Literally to the Moon - Electron's Capstone Mission](https://preview.redd.it/hq5mcset5p3e1.png?width=1786&format=png&auto=webp&s=dee6c94313ff18c3c7a9c27bc28a84338d2094ac)

Small but powerful ‚Äì On June 28, 2022, Rocket Lab launched a CubeSat to the Moon - a pathfinding mission to support NASA‚Äôs Artemis program which will land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon.

**Electron‚Äôs existential crisis, or not?** ‚Äì While Electron has limitations in terms of carry capacity of 300 kg to LEO and the threat of SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 Transporter Rideshare missions, Electron‚Äôs reliability and responsiveness together with its tailor-made missions have continued providing strength in demand evident from the signing of multi-launch agreements with its customers (Synspective, Capella Space, Blacksky etc.) Many discuss the threat of Electron being replaced by larger rockets, such as SpaceX‚Äôs Transporter rideshares or even Neutron cannibalising Electron in the future. However, just like taking an Uber directly to your destination or the bus somewhere near but not quite your destination, Electron together with its kick stage provides unrivaled accuracy, hitting target orbits with pinpoint accuracy.

**Why Capella Space chose Electron over Rideshare** 

‚ÄúInstead of burning propellant to raise altitude, it‚Äôs far easier to simply be dropped off at a higher orbit by the launch vehicle. Being able to go higher than available rideshare missions was a major factor in Capella‚Äôs decision to pull Capella-9 from its planned launch and procure a dedicated ride from Rocket Lab for Capella-9 and Capella-10, which were launched in March 2023 on an Electron rocket to a targeted 600 km. This was also a major motivation behind the follow-on contract for four dedicated launches on Electron rockets for Acadia-generation satellites, the first of which launched to a targeted 640 km in August 2023‚Äù

[Continued Strong Demand for Electron](https://preview.redd.it/9hfpllwg6p3e1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=89128d9ce6e6660cdcb992ff6f3fdf0609146069)

The demand for Electron is also seen to be strong with the Average Selling Price increasing to what was $7.5 million to now $8.4 million. Furthermore, many of Electron‚Äôs direct competitors, mostly small launch ‚Äòaspirational‚Äô space companies have now been eliminated from the market.¬†

[ Astra Space Rocket 3 \(Dead\), Virgin Orbit LauncherOne \(Dead\), ABL Space RS1\(Dead\), Relativity Terran 1 \(Dead\), Firefly Alpha \(Dead Soon?\) ](https://preview.redd.it/57p1sfxr6p3e1.png?width=1795&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7b46dc23f26f9abd7236e9fd03fdbffc8789f8f)

It is NOT Rocket Science. Can‚Äôt really say that in this industry. Entrants to the small launch space have not fared well, many attribute it to a lack of demand as some pivot to larger launchers but in truth it seems that Electron has cemented its place as THE small launch provider.

**2. Haste**

https://preview.redd.it/v3l86x177p3e1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=30266164d98e447732f8e430c99bb58d3a4b887c

HASTE is a suborbital testbed launch vehicle derived from Rocket Lab‚Äôs heritage Electron rocket. HASTE provides reliable, high-cadence flight test opportunities needed to advance hypersonic and suborbital system technology development. Hypersonic speed is at least five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5 and above

[Types of Adaptions of Electron payload for HASTE vs Space-Based Orbital Electron](https://preview.redd.it/x7qeoojz7p3e1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b1fcbe1a09d5f8d9e6e7f8299e281d99bf53245)

# 

From air-breathing and glide payloads to ballistic and future technologies, HASTE is a cost-effective and responsive hypersonic testbed that enables precision payload delivery for every mission.

[Leidos was awarded $334M air-breathing hypersonic system contract](https://preview.redd.it/rzpb8vfp8p3e1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=4995acc3b4ce982c65204c7969cc708a73981ec1)

Rocket Lab has had two HASTE missions so far, with the first HASTE mission on 17 June 2023 for Leidos. Leidos was awarded [$334M air-breathing hypersonic contract](https://www.leidos.com/insights/leidos-awarded-334m-air-breathing-hypersonic-system-contract) in 2022.

Russia has already demonstrated its use of the Khinzal hypersonic missile in Ukraine and the Pentagon‚Äôs warning to the congress that China already possesses the world‚Äôs leading hypersonic arsenal, the United States still does not possess its own arsenal of hypersonic missiles. As the US plays catch up, Rocket Lab stands to win, with at least another 3 HASTE missions for Leidos for 2024/2025  as part of the MACH-TB (Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed program.

Instead of highlighting how large the Total Addressable Market hypersonics could be, it would be more useful to highlight the innovation of Rocket Lab and also management‚Äôs ability to understand its technologies to adapt and create new use cases.

**3. Space Systems**

[We Don't Just Build Rockets in this Lab](https://preview.redd.it/03v1c2fk9p3e1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=27f2b92571ecd7eb36c692bb14caf370aa86db7b)

While rockets are really nice to look at, it is important to understand that launch business makes up only 20-30% of revenue of Rocket Lab, with Space Systems making up the majority of revenue contribution. Rocket Lab‚Äôs expansion into Space Systems through in-house capabilities or through acquisition is what seems to be most under-rated by investors/analysts.

**THIS IS WHERE I AM REALLY BULLISH. RECURRING REVENUE. MORE STUFF IN SPACE = MORE RECURRING REVENUE**

Starlink satellites have a lifespan of about five years. After which it will re-enter the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere and be destroyed. Satellites need replenishing, and companies are heading towards mega constellations to provide their services, Rocket Lab will either manufacture, provide components, flight software or even deploy them with Neutron. With the space economy projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030, and $1.8 trillion by 2035. Rocket Lab‚Äôs position as an end-to-end space company seems like a no-brainer as long as the company is able to capture a portion and with more than 1,700 satellites launched to orbit with Rocket Lab technology already, it seems to be on the right path. Some highlights of Rocket Lab‚Äôs space systems.

**a. Reaction Wheels**

[Love that we now ship pallets of reaction wheels to constellation customers. - Peter Beck](https://preview.redd.it/fofd4136bp3e1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=26d87d2a06b834269b21f22762292abb2dd2e37a)

A satellite typically needs at least three reaction wheels to control its movement along the X, Y, and Z axes. However, satellites often have four reaction wheels for redundancy

Deal already signed with a [single confidential mega constellation customer ](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/24/rocket-lab-reveals-big-supplier-deal-with-mystery-mega-constellation-customer/#:~:text=In%20its%20data%20sheet%20on,the%20base%20price%20at%20%24100%2C000)for thousands of reaction wheels per year. If you‚Äôre wondering who it could be‚Ä¶ [Amazzz](https://www.youtube.com/live/wmmNuU8-Tr8?si=xpO2MeoKJ2KyHw5F&t=1218)

Amazon‚Äôs Kuiper constellation will have an initial 3,236 satellites Which likely will need replenishing every five years as well. That‚Äôs a good stream of recurring revenue for reaction wheels alone.

[\~4,000 to 5,000 satellites launched annually in 2030 - McKinsey](https://preview.redd.it/lmb1i4tmcp3e1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e5378628bdb2ce794333f878b8f54c530979638)

McKinsey anticipates in the base case, 27,000 active satellites in orbit by the end of 2030, almost a four-fold increase from today. To maintain that number at the assumed lifespan, there would need to be 4,000 to 5,000 satellites launched per year. In the high-demand scenario, in which nearly all proposed constellations materialize, McKinsey would expect to see more than 65,000 satellites, including many heavier ones, on orbit by 2030.

**b. Space Grade Solar**

[In 2022, Rocket Lab acquired leading satellite solar power producer SolAero Technologies. ](https://preview.redd.it/boenu4xrdp3e1.png?width=921&format=png&auto=webp&s=35bc3927f9baa504c4f498ec3ffddf844c274cd2)

Satellites need power. With the acquisition of Sol Aero, Rocket Lab is now one of the few space grade solar providers. Already there are more than 1,100 satellites in space powered by Rocket Lab solar products. The company has also been [awarded $23.9million](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-11-25/us-finalizes-awards-to-bae-systems-rocket-lab-for-semiconductor-chips) to boost the company‚Äôs production of solar cells by 50% over the next three years.

**c. Separation Systems**

[No separation anxiety - Example of Rocket Lab‚Äôs Separation System](https://preview.redd.it/i8s75ussep3e1.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a75dda0512efd875bab92e6f01da9ca86fee5d96)

In 2021 Rocket Lab acquired Planetary Systems Corporation which has designed, built, and delivered separation systems for more than 20 years with a 100% success rate - no product has ever failed to operate in flight. With the scale and resources of Rocket Lab behind the team, we are now making separation systems available globally at scale.

**d. Space Software**

[In October 2021, Rocket Lab acquired Advanced Solutions, Inc \(ASI\), a Colorado-based aerospace engineering firm delivering mission proven space software, mission simulation, and testing solutions.](https://preview.redd.it/quczg7jyep3e1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=98c4593cdd1a44f7e5e3377c5ea0b8be3c21a571)

As part of the end-to-end service, Rocket Lab also provides software and operation for customer satellites.

The vertically integrated and end-to-end space service Rocket Lab provides will allow customers who are looking to provide a service from space do so without any knowledge of building and operating spacecrafts.

Right now companies like Varda are still space companies applying pharmaceutical and life science applications, and even have outsourced [Rocket Lab will to conduct in-space operations](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-completes-second-spacecraft-for-varda-space-industries-advancing-in-space-manufacturing/), reentry positioning maneuvers, and deorbiting to recover Varda‚Äôs capsule while they attempt to develop the own in-house solutions. However, Rocket Lab's end goal as THE end-to-end space provider, is for companies with no knowledge of building or operating spacecrafts contracting Rocket Lab for its services.

**4. Catalysts**  
Written so much and I have not even covered Neutron, Space Race, Possibility with Mars Sample Return, NSSL Neutron On-ramping, SDA Contracts, Human rated Neutron launches. I'll point over to [Dave G Investing's video](https://youtu.be/rt4_g87TxL8?si=PHAi9oegs_13u0AL) on the potential nearer term catalysts, I think he covers it in great detail.

[Dave G Investing - Potential Catalysts](https://preview.redd.it/xvnfaef9jp3e1.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=540f11194cebd49866ceb72b3b7a7e6e628b4a0c)

Further term growth opportunities include Neutron signing more commercial launches to deploy constellations or even taking on some contracts to help deploy Kuiper if any of their launch providers for their 83 launches fail to deliver. Also as SPB mentioned, Neutron‚Äôs success will then allow for Rocket Lab to develop its own constellation. These catalysts really show the uncapped potential of the company, which makes valuing the company today extremely difficult, which is why I will be holding my shares, at least a good amount of it till 2030.

**5. Conclusion**

Trust in SPB. He knows Rockets. Watch Wild Wild Space on HBO for those who haven't.

Rocket engineer at heart, he developed Electron with less than $100 million compared to rockets like Virgin Orbit's LauncherOne estimated to be over $1 billion and still failed.

RKLB_posts.csv,Should You Buy $RKLB After the Big Run-Up? Here‚Äôs a Litmus Test,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve noticed a lot of posts lately asking, ‚ÄúShould I buy $RKLB now after the huge price increase?‚Äù Here‚Äôs a litmus test to help guide your decision:

First, ask yourself: If you already owned the stock, would you sell it now? If the answer is no because you think the price will continue to rise, then why wouldn‚Äôt you buy more now? If you believe in the company‚Äôs long-term future, the recent run-up shouldn‚Äôt deter you.

Remember, investors are in it for the long haul. Traders are the ones making short-term moves. And if you‚Äôre asking a biased community for financial advice, it‚Äôs probably a sign that you‚Äôre not the best trader. Timing the market is notoriously difficult, and most people don‚Äôt get it right.

So instead of focusing on short-term fluctuations, ask yourself if Rocket Lab‚Äôs long-term vision aligns with your investment goals. Don‚Äôt try to time the market‚Äîmake decisions based on your confidence in the company‚Äôs future.

As always, do your own research and assess your personal financial situation.

Tony Kim, Head of Technology Investing at BlackRock, discusses AST SpaceMobile and Rocket Lab at the Deutsche Bank Global Space Summit 2024.

‚ÄúIn the public market, I think there are two companies that are over $5B and they have been a recent resurgence, but it has been 20 years of hell. But there has been a recent resurgence of two companies that crossed $5B of market cap ‚Ä¶. And the two are not posterchilds of profitability. What they are is that they represent leadership. The power log ?
In the case of one company regarding potentially unlocking direct communications and the other one , the alternative to SpaceX on launch. So those are the two. They‚Äôre not really profitable yet, but they have the market valuation. The rest, they are mired in small subset of valuations? So yes, profitability is of course important, but I think more important is, are you a viable business with scale. Are you one of the companies that will achieve scale. And with scale comes profitability.‚Äù

RKLB_posts.csv,The Intangibles are important - and its looking better for Rocket Lab,"I kinda feel sorry for SpaceX lately.  They have done some fantastic engineering and I‚Äôm sure have a lot of great people but their CEO and 50% owner has become a huge distraction.  The new private space race is in its infancy so a good head start isn‚Äôt enough.  Maintaining superiority in an industry over decades is difficult.  Do you know how many auto manufactures didn‚Äôt make it?  If you want to see what negative publicity can do to a superior product, go read the story of Preston Tucker or watch the movie.  

If Musk had just kept the problem to X, it would probably be fine but now he is using Starlink to defy the Brazilian Government.  I know that their government involved Starlink first but instead of backing down he is doubling down.  This could have long term ramifications if worldwide governments think Musk has no respect for their laws and start to put laws in place to limit his power in their countries.  I can guarantee these discussions are happening.  

The other problem for SpaceX now is their CEO decided to bet on one horse instead of just remaining neutral.  If his horse loses, there is no way he will see support from a Harris/Walz administration.  Musk is posting pictures of Harris as a Russian General‚Ä¶such a dumb move if you really want government contracts. I‚Äôm sure there are people in SpaceX that have left or are thinking of leaving because they don‚Äôt want to work for Musk anymore.  Again‚Ä¶.that will benefit Rocket lab and Blue Origin and maybe a few of the other startups looking to scale quickly.

Blue Origin and Rocket Lab are poised to take advantage of these missteps by Musk.  That is why you see nothing about the election from Bezos and Beck because they are much smarter and know that to overtake SpaceX at this point you just put your head down and do the work.  There isn‚Äôt any need to attack Musk‚Ä¶he is lighting himself on fire.",208,25,https://i.redd.it/y80va2ienlmd1.jpeg,0.8358,0.141,0.752,0.107

RKLB_posts.csv,Why I think RKLB is a hold ,"I'm seeing a lot of new people popping up in this sub talking about gainz for ants. Y'all shortsighted motherfuckers. Look at the macro picture: 

1. US/China space race heating up. China is seen as a ""pacing challenge"" by the US military. Last time this shit happened during the Cold War, NASA spending reached 4.5% of federal budget. 

2. NO to monopoly. National security shit is not allowed to have a monopoly. Spacex will never be the only player. And it's valued at 200 bil, almost 50x what rklb is worth.

3. The huge TAM of space services in general. Lunar exploration, mars, LEO sats, spy sats, LEO experimental medicine, low gravity manufacturing etc. A lot of it is speculative you say? Well that's what investing in tech is about aye? You're looking for the NEXT BIG THING, not the last big thing. You might as well do GEICO and Coca Cola if you're of that bent. 

4. Actual working rocket and workable path to another big ass rocket. How many other companies you know put their money where their mouth is and can execute to a high level. Shit, even bezos is fking up with blue origin. I have more confidence in someone who has actually made a rocket fly, than some shit that's still on the pad. 

5. A good underpromise over deliver CEO. Sir Beck doesn't shoot his mouth off. Wanna know what that means? It means if he's anything like Musk, share price would be a multiple of what it is with hype. And I'm all for execute first hype later. 

6. Improving macro environment. Last time we had a massive reduction in rates after 08, there's a boom for 10 years. 2011 to 2021 were some of the best times in the market. Now with lower rates, you bet your ass the rotation into small and mid caps is gonna happen. Not least because lower rates make capital raising and debt obligations a lot more manageable.

Any newbs out there that don‚Äôt know this, RocketLab last year had had to punt being on boarded because they no longer had a credible path to launch in 2024.

I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious right now that a path to launch in 2025 is extremely credible and in a years time they should be scoring some of these contracts.

These are yearly awards, so for shit and giggles let‚Äôs say Neutron scores half these launches.

4 launches at probably 70 to 80 million (DoD are extra juicy compared to a standard 55 million dollar launch.) That revenue is what RocketLab has made this entire year so far. 

I get distracted dreaming about MSR and the current stock price, but Neutron scaling is such a big deal. So much Cheddar.

RKLB_posts.csv,An Observation ,"I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre all excited about another monster trading session after a surreal run up.  I‚Äôm probably not the only one wondering each week if, and when, the eventual pull back is going to happen..  only to see the stock go higher.

I thought I‚Äôd share a quick story of an interaction earlier today to give some context to what many of us wrestle with.

I went to PT this morning, and we were shooting the breeze about life when she asked what I was up to.  We‚Äôre pretty good friends at this point, and the conversation drifted towards investing since it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm passionate about.  Naturally, Rocket Lab came up, and she was genuinely curious so I spent some time sharing the bullet points about the company, Peter Beck, the sector, etc.  The other two providers that were nearby joined in the conversation since they didn‚Äôt have clients at the time, and so I talked to them about it too.

What was absolutely fascinating to me was that none of them had ever heard of Rocket Lab.  These are intelligent, accomplished, capable medical professionals.  

People like to joke about you know it‚Äôs time to sell when you over hear Uber & Lyft drivers talking about a stock.  I think the opposite is true as well.  Anecdotally, outside of this sub, WSB, and X/twitter, there is practically no one in my professional or personal spheres that has heard of this company - unless I‚Äôve personally told them about it.  

My point is..  the recent run up as been incredible, and while there is a very real possibility of a drawback in the near future, especially for some unforeseen news or black swan event, this company is still one of the best kept secrets.  

Of course I could be wrong, and there is a lot of risk ahead and plenty that could go badly..  However, I think this is still just the initial wave crashing upon the shoreline.  Once more people clue in, it‚Äôs going to be interesting.

I‚Äôd be very curious how many folks on this sub have had anyone tell them about RKLB, and not the other way around.

RKLB_posts.csv,Rocket Lab Owns 2/3 of the U.S. Launch Market -- That Isn't SpaceX,"https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/rocket-lab-owns-2-3-120000860.html

When Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB) reported second-quarter earnings last week, it ignited a multiday rally that sent its stock price soaring as much as 18%. And no wonder.

Sales at the small space rocket manufacturer soared 71% year over year, beating analyst forecasts. The per-share loss for the quarter was $0.08 -- not great -- but still better than the $0.10 loss that Wall Street forecast.

A historic quarter

In fact, Chief Executive Officer Peter Beck said Q2 was Rocket Lab's ""highest revenue quarter in company history"" -- no great surprise given that each succeeding quarter shows revenue growth. But Beck also said that Rocket Lab is seeing ""strong and growing demand for our launch services and space systems products,"" such as the Electron rocket, Photon kick stage spacecraft, and satellites built for the U.S. Space Force. The company is also making progress on new products to power profit in the future.

First and foremost among these are the new Neutron rocket, a medium-lift rocket that, in a unique twist on traditional design, encapsulates its second stage within a reusable first stage with an integrated (and also reusable) payload fairing.

In last week's press release, Rocket Lab highlighted the recent successful first hot fire test of the Archimedes engine, nine of which will be used to power Neutron's first stage. Four days later, Rocket Lab posted a ""how it started, how it's going"" photo comparison on X first showing CEO Beck standing next to a mockup of the then-just-announced Neutron concept vehicle, side by side with a completed half-fairing for a real-life Neutron rocket.

What's more, just one day earlier, Rocket Lab announced its 10th mission so far this year, the launch of a Capella Space satellite to orbit atop an Electron rocket. Crucially, this was the first launch for Capella since September 2023, when an anomaly in an Electron rocket's second stage resulted in a loss of the payload. The fact that Capella maintained its faith in Rocket Lab -- and that faith was vindicated with a successful launch over the weekend -- has to come as happy news for Rocket Lab shareholders.

SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and ULA -- in that order

So yes, it's been a busy few days for Rocket Lab, and jam-packed with good news. Now here's some less good news.

According to Beck, Rocket Lab's Electron has become ""the most frequently launched small rocket globally."" And so far this year, Rocket Lab is responsible for ""64% of all non-SpaceX orbital U.S. launches in 2024 to date."" That sounds impressive, but it comes with a big caveat. SpaceX orbital U.S. launches already number 79 (and probably more by the time this article publishes). Meanwhile, Rocket Lab's 64% amounts to only 10 launches total.

That actually gives you a better idea of the distance between No. 2 rocket launcher Rocket Lab and No. 3 United Launch Alliance (ULA has launched four times this year, making up about 28% of non-SpaceX orbital U.S. launches), than of how close Rocket Lab is to overtaking SpaceX.

Hint: It's not even close. For the foreseeable future, the great American space race is going to remain with SpaceX as No. 1, then a big gap with everybody else.

The race for No. 2

Investors also need to be aware that Rocket Lab faces some serious competition even in the race to remain No. 2 to SpaceX.

Don't get me wrong. Rocket Lab is accelerating its launch cadence. Its revenue is accelerating. And there's a very real chance Rocket Lab will turn profitable in the next year or two. Still, now that United Launch Alliance has its new Vulcan rocket operational, it's moving quickly to regain its traditional role as one of America's leading launch companies. As I pointed out earlier this month, ULA currently has 23 Vulcan rockets in various stages of construction, and ULA CEO Tory Bruno is promising investors he will launch 20 times next year, and 25 times in 2026.

With 10 launches under its belt already in 2024, and more on the way, Rocket Lab could still out-launch ULA, and remain America's No. 2 launch provider in the future. But ULA is definitely going to try and give Rocket Lab a run for its money.",154,13,https://i.redd.it/h1c1fwpaemkd1.jpeg,0.9969,0.137,0.803,0.06

Options are very tempting at the moment given the run RKLB had this quarter. Every stock will have pullback. When it does, time value eat away potential profits.

Your best bet through earnings is to buy the stock and sell out of the money covered calls for November end. The money you make from the covered calls, you can put it back into RKLB to increase your share count. Don't despair if your options are called. Do it again.

Consider buying options when RSI goes below 40 and MACDs are in negative territory. This is where technical analysis will help you.

If the options you bought are expiring worthless, you giving free money to whales. A $1000 from you pocket may not seem much. But a hundred players like yourself giving free money to whales every week is Big Whale Money.

RKLB_posts.csv,Betting my whole portfolio on RKLB,"Before anyone losses their mind about going all in on one stock, I own my own business and have a 401k. I am not relying on this at all for my day to day living. I am 36 and have 3 kids. Still drive the same truck and live in the same house. 

I put 350k ""borrowed half of that"" during covid on oil ""SM energy"" and turned it to 1.5m. As you can see I am maxed out on margin and keep an eye on it every day. I am definitely not a millionaire and am making the largest gamble of my life by reinvesting my whole portfolio into one stock. 

Due to volatility and RL being a small cap, TD will only lend 1/3 of my equity. I have to leverage a less volitaile stock to be able to have more margin. I was doing that with OXY before but didn't want to book the losses on BABA yet, so I sold OXY.  I'm still getting my ass kicked on BABA but hoping it has bottomed. 

Whatever gains from BABA ""passed my margin balance"", will be used to buy more RKLB. 

Yes, this is risky as hell, but I truly believe Rocket Lab at these levels is the opportunity of a lifetime. 

The biggest risk I see to RL is not actually Space X IMO. I believe it's Relativity Space and Firefly. FF because it will challenge Electron and Nuetron with their small and medium payload. Then Relativity because of their price point per kilogram with Terran R. We have all seen what happened to Virgin Orbit and ASTRA, but FF and RS seem to have unlimited funding for now. 

That all being said, competition is healthy and demand will only grow. The one thing that puts me at ease, is that RL is investing it such more than just luanch. Their recent Photon Launch on Falcon 9 ""which they netted more on than Space X"", shows one example of that when Peter Beck said, ""eventually I want everything in space to have a Rocket Lab Logo"" he meant it. 

Space Systems is currently bringing in more revenue than launch, and the TAM for Space is currently 10x that of launch.

RL is so much more than just a launch company. Happy to make the biggest bet of my life on a company that seems determined to be leader in the Space Industry! 

Can we please meet up for the Nuetron Launch?

I will post with you guys whether I get my ass kicked or this pays off for all of us.

RKLB_posts.csv,Simple DD for Newcomers.,"RKLB builds satellites and rockets currently it has operational Electron small launch rocket with over 50 launches. They are working on a big rocket called Neutron which will be Reusable. As well as a suite of various satellites.

What is a reusable rocket and why is it important?

Most rockets ever to exist have been expendable, meaning they get destroyed or become museum peices. Imagine the cost of an airplane ticket if you had to build a 747 airplane fly across the world and trash the 747 every time. That's basically what humanity did until SpaceX proved it was possible to land rockets with Falcon 9. The concept has been proven. Rocket Lab along with a few others are chasing this dream. Since SpaceX landed Falcon 9 and became reusable no one has been able to duplicate this and the company is now worth 210 billion market cap, they are in first place a huge leap ahead of everyone.

Furthermore, Rocket Lab builds the satellites for many of the launches, satellite components and has a huge space systems division and sells a service, which means they scoop up way more profit margin. They are far ahead all others (excluding SpaceX) and plan to launch the first Neutron mid 2025 and will become profitable shortly after. 

Neutron will be designed to be reusable from day 1 where Falcon 9 was not which will give them a big advantage in design. 

RKLB is only valued around 3.2 billion to SpaceXs 210 billion. Pennies on the dollar and most agree it is wildly undervalued right now. 

So, proof of concept has been established by SpaceX, Rocket Lab has tons of space and launch experience with their Electron Rocket being the second most frequently launched rocket. They have hundreds of millions in cash reserves to finish the development, the Archimedes engine that powers Neutron has just fired up for the first time recently after 3 yesrs of hard work and engines are the longest lead time in building a rocket. No other company is in a more perfect position to become and remain the #2 space company in the world. Once Neutron is successful and launching, this company should easily be worth 20-50 billion dollars ($45-$100 stock price) fair value still a fraction of SpaceX, they will be able to launch their own mega satellite constellations.

The CEO and Founder Peter Beck is an absolute genius, self taught rocket scientist and has been regarded as such by many influential people in the industry.

The meme potential is fun and could be nice, the fundamental potential... the sky is the limit.

# Introduction

With the 2024 first launch of the Rocket Lab Mega Constellation Launcher‚ÄîThe Neutron‚Äîfast approaching, I decided it is high time for a more up-to-date DD on Rocket Lab. A lot is happening in the industry, the company, and the world. I have decided to dive into the future, fundamentals, industry, funding, financials, dreams, and of course, the memes of the aspiring space company. Now, I am posting my DD into both of the Rocket Lab subreddit, as I am new to writing DD and I want to hit as wide of an audience as I can. One disclaimer (for those who do not like stock talk), this DD is not meant to encourage buying of the stock, nor is it financial advice or a stock-only DD, I merely want to dive into this company and simply spark some discussion on it!

Now, Rocket Lab is a private aerospace manufacturer and small satellite launch service provider. The company was founded in 2006 by Peter Beck and is headquartered in Long Beach, California, with additional facilities in New Zealand and Australia. Rocket Lab specializes in the development and launch of small rockets capable of delivering payloads of up to 300 kilograms to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab‚Äîself-designated as a leader in launch and space systems‚Äîis a company that has a chance at becoming a highly profitable giant over the next decade and beyond. In my honest opinion, Rocket Lab currently thrives off of the crumbs of the current space industry ecosystem. With Space X increasingly focused upon one goal‚Äîthanks to their controversial, yet nevertheless, fearless leader‚Äîbeing Mars, Rocket Labs can (and in my opinion will) become one of the go-to space companies for low earth orbit launches in the near term and in the long-term become one of the go-to space company for launches between the Moon, Venus, and Mars as well. Rocket Lab currently lives off of the crumbs left behind by NASA, Space X, and the United States military-industrial complex.

[Like these two legends from the movie War Dogs, Rocket Lab is determined to become the go-to space company for transporting all types of goods into orbit. For those of you who have not seen the movie \(I personally highly recommend it\), essentially, when these two start their arms-dealing company, they focus upon all of the small contracts that the government is putting out for arms supplies. The contracts that the big players are ignoring, due to their small sizes, even so, these small contracts are worth hundreds of thousands to low millions. Now, this is where Rocket Lab currently lies in the industry.](https://preview.redd.it/ang8zdp4pd4b1.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=22e61dcd7a2bd3aed7dae5bbe0b5776ec955c7ba)

[\\""A new space race has begun, and most Americans are not even aware of it. This race is not \[about\] political prestige or military power. This new race involves the whole human species in a contest against time.\\"" - Ben Bova](https://preview.redd.it/9mmd18f6pd4b1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=afd7ab06311acea60bae95af0dec2b4b1e98b3e5)

Now, before I dive into everything here, I need every to understand that this industry is on the verge of immense change and rapid evolution. We are currently in the first stage of the world‚Äôs Second Space Race. As a student of History, I can confidently tell you that there are murmurings within the historical community, that this is the case, beginning with the creation and success of Space X‚Äôs first reusable rocket: the Falcon 9. On December 21st of 2015, when the first Falcon 9 was launched and the landing was successful with the first stage fully recovered, the race began. In the same way that there is no single company above all others in the airline, shipping & transportation, or car manufacturing industries, is the same reason I do not believe that Space X will alone run the space industry‚Äôs transportation needs. There is plenty of room for companies like Rocket Lab to fill the gaps Space X cannot and in a decade‚Äôs time, there will be plenty of room for even more companies. Yet, there are no companies that are even close to competing with Space X‚Äîother than Rocket Lab‚Äîat this time. Now, I won‚Äôt go deeply into most of these competitors in this deep dive, but to be short, Astra is on the verge of total failure, Virgin Galactic has been playing an entirely different game‚Äîspace tourism, which there is a massive market for, just perhaps won‚Äôt be penetrated by them‚Äîthey likewise seem to be failing. While Blue Origin has been playing a strong game and Space X an even stronger one, albeit more and more focused solely on Mars as the years go on.

[  Here you can see the 1-year charts of Rocket Lab, Astra, Virgin, and Boeing for reference, as you can see, these charts speak volumes. Rocket Lab has been having a tough year but has found a nice bottom and is consistently bouncing from lows in the $3.6-4 range. While Astra has been reduced to a penny stock, with their future unknown. Virgin Galactic is only maintaining below Rocket Lab‚Äôs share price, partly due to the large number of Retail investors that do not know much and refuse to let it die, coupled with a small hope that the company can recover in the coming years. Boeing is here for reference as to what a successful, large-cap company involved in a similar industry \(and the space industry as well\), should look like over the course of a decent year.](https://preview.redd.it/r63hheb9pd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=10f9df21a4c592bf9fa5d07927d7df1217a4707c)

*Now, there are a few assumptions that I am making that we need to cover before diving into the real DD:* Whether it be because we live in the beginnings of a second Space Race (fueled by privatized space companies and the world‚Äôs governments) or because of technological advancement and a rising interest in space, the increase in rocket launches, space development (in Earth‚Äôs orbit, the Moon, and Mars), and the lowering costs of space launches‚Ä¶ it will become exponentially cheaper, easier, and faster to launch into orbit and the industry as a whole will have a massive boom‚Äîakin, in a way, to the industrial revolution‚Äîover the mid-to-late 2020s into the early 2030s. With the mid-to-end 2030s and early 2040s, we will see massive developments in terms of low-Earth orbit manufacturing facilities, tourist destinations, and stations, as well as settlements on the Moon for mining and refueling for greater exploration and colonization of the Sol System as a whole.

Now these are in part assumptions, but I think once one does the research and looks at the fact, all of this is very achievable. Even if it does not occur in this way, you can shift the dates by an additional decade and every time you do, the more likely, easier, and cheaper it all becomes.

Rocket Lab's business model revolves around providing cost-effective and frequent access to space for small satellite operators. The company aims to simplify the process of deploying satellites by offering dedicated launches on its Electron rocket. Rocket Lab operates as an end-to-end service provider, handling the entire launch process from mission planning and payload integration to launch and on-orbit operations.

# Section 1: Rocket Lab Takes Flight! The Electron & the Neutron

[  ‚ÄòRocket Lab is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, complete spacecraft design and manufacturing, satellite components, flight software, and on-orbit management.‚Äô ‚Äì Rocket Labs](https://preview.redd.it/kfcdll9dpd4b1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=e05df5ae09c39df476981844a7beded28082beda)

Rocket Lab's primary launch vehicle, the Electron, is a two-stage rocket powered by Rutherford engines, which use electric-pump-fed LOX/RP-1 propellants. The Electron is designed to optimize cost, flexibility, and rapid launch capability for small satellites. Rocket Lab has demonstrated numerous successful launches since its inaugural flight in 2017, showcasing its technological prowess and reliability. The small satellite market has been growing rapidly, driven by increased demand for data collection, communications, and Earth observation. Rocket Lab's focus on dedicated launches for small satellites positions it well to capture a significant portion of this expanding market. The company has already established a solid customer base, securing contracts with government agencies, research institutions, and commercial entities.

Rocket Labs‚Äîat the time of writing this‚Äîhas had 37 launches‚Äîwith a 91.89% success rate‚Äîdeployed 164 satellites, operates 3 launch pads, and is maintaining 3 Photon Satellites in the Earth‚Äôs orbit. Of the 164 satellites launched by Rocket Labs, they were commissioned to do so by a wide variety of clients, from NASA, Space Force, DARPA, to Canon. Rocket Labs is supported by Future Fund: Australia‚Äôs Sovereign Wealth Fund, Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Data Collective, Greenspring Associates, ACC, Promus Ventures, L One W One Ltd., and Lockheed Martin.

Rocket Lab‚Äôs main rocket, the Electron‚Äîbuilt and operated by Rocket Lab‚Äîhas flown 37 times and been successful 34 times, with only 3 failures. Rocket Lab‚Äôs key areas of business penetration lie in the launch of mid-sized service rockets, the manufacturing of space systems and satellites, and their adept ability to manufacture industrial space parts, applications, and proponents. The latter of which, they are sort of unopposed in terms of competition.

The Neutron‚ÄîRocket Lab‚Äôs medium-lift, mega constellation launcher‚Äîwill be able to launch 13,000 kilograms into low Earth orbit and it will be ‚Ä¶drum roll please‚Ä¶ reusable! The current goal is for it to launch in 2024. It will be designed for not only low earth orbital supply missions, but also deep space missions, and even human spaceflight. It will be fairing a design allowing for full reusability of the first stage and it will be lightweight, being made of Rock Lab‚Äôs own carbon composite structure. The home base for the Neutron will be at the Neutron Production Complex and the launch pad at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility and Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.

[  ‚ÄòThe Neutron Production Complex will be home to a rocket production, assembly, and integration facility, as well as a dedicated launch pad for the Neutron rocket located on the southern end of Wallops Island. The estimated 250,000 square-foot state-of-the-art complex will be constructed on a 28-acre site adjacent to the Wallops Island Flight Facility and will include a Launch Control Center, Rocket Lab‚Äôs fifth global operations center for launch activities and on-orbit operations. To support rapid production of the Neutron rocket, current plans for the complex include automated fiber placement robotic production systems capable of laying up meters of Neutron‚Äôs new, specially formulated carbon composite structures in minutes. As a reusable rocket, Neutron is designed to land back on the Launch Complex 3 pad after a mission and from there it would be returned to the production complex for refurbishment and re-flight.‚Äô](https://preview.redd.it/cove17mgpd4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d5058d8a8e4e79c9fbc63dfea4b0e5680d3a137)

With Space X dominating large-load space orbital flight and transportation, Rocket Labs, in my honest opinion, is where Space X was roughly something like 6-8 years ago. While Rocket Lab intends to compete with Space X‚Äîwhether it will be considered competition in an industry this brand new and small, time will tell‚Äîfor cargo and humans to the low Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and even Venus! Space X and Elon Musk have made it abundantly clear that the goal of Space X is the large-scale settlement of Mars. While later models of Rocket Lab‚Äôs Neutron will be able to go to Mars and Venus, it appears that is not their main goal. In the near term (being the next two decades), they will be looking to dominate the low Earth orbit and Moon market as well as the manufacturing of industrial space parts, applications, and proponents.

# Section 2: The Space Industry & Company Fundamentals

Rocket Lab faces competition from other commercial launch providers, such as SpaceX, and Blue Origin. However, the company differentiates itself by specializing in small satellite launches, offering a tailored solution for this niche market. Rocket Lab's Electron rocket provides the advantage of dedicated launches and the flexibility to reach specific orbits, making it an attractive option for small satellite operators.

Rocket Lab has raised significant funding through various investment rounds, securing capital from venture capital firms, strategic partners, and government entities. Notable investors include Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Lockheed Martin. The company's ability to attract substantial investment indicates confidence in its business model and growth potential. Rocket Lab operates within the regulatory framework of the countries in which it launches its rockets. The company holds necessary licenses and approvals from government agencies, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Compliance with safety regulations and adherence to environmental guidelines are crucial aspects of Rocket Lab's operations.

Despite its achievements, Rocket Lab faces several risks and challenges. The space industry is highly competitive, and the success of the company depends on its ability to secure launch contracts and maintain a steady launch cadence. Regulatory changes, launch failures, or delays could impact Rocket Lab's operations and reputation. Additionally, the emergence of new technologies or market disruptors could pose a threat to the company's market position

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room, the Quarterly Results. To preface, negative quarterly results mean‚Äîpardon my French‚Äîjack-shit (at least in the short term) for a company such as Rocket Lab, that is looking at penetrating a market such as the space industry. We are going to look at the past four Quarterly Results in chronological order.

**Q2 2022 Report:** Rocket Lab achieved record revenue of $55.5 million, showing significant growth compared to the previous quarter (36% sequential growth) and the same quarter in the previous year (392% YoY growth). Despite the revenue growth, the company reported a negative EPS of $-0.08, indicating a net loss for the quarter.

**Q3 2022 Report:** Another record revenue was achieved, reaching $63.1 million, with a sequential growth of 14% and an impressive YoY growth of 1,093%. The company's EPS improved slightly to $-0.07 but still remained negative. The fourth quarter revenue is expected to be lower, ranging between $51 million and $54 million, as a launch customer's push extends into 2023.

**Q4 2022 Report:** The company's revenue for Q4 reached $51.8 million, showing a healthy year-over-year growth of 88%. The full-year revenue for fiscal 2022 amounted to $211 million, reflecting substantial growth of 239% compared to the previous year. The EPS remained negative at $-0.08.

**Q1 2023 Report:** The revenue for Q1 2023 was $54.9 million. Increasing revenue by 35% in the first quarter of 2023. Revenue from their launch business was $19.6 million, up $12 million from the prior quarter. Their EPS was $-0.08, indicating a strong maintenance of their business. The second quarter is expected to show a significant revenue increase, with an estimated range of $60 million to $63 million.

Now, what does this all tell us? Firstly, they were very forthcoming with the quarterly expectations. Something one might think is not a big deal, but considering how a lot of publicly traded companies operate, this is a good thing. In each of their earnings reports, they have nearly exactly estimated their results, showing they are not attempting to mislead investors. The company has experienced impressive revenue growth throughout the reported quarters, indicating strong market performance and demand for its products/services. However, the negative EPS values suggest that the company is still operating at a net loss. From a shareholder‚Äôs perspective, the company's focus should be on achieving profitability and reducing the negative EPS, while maintaining consistent revenue growth. In my opinion, this stock is sitting just below a fair market value for what it is right now, sitting at just over $4, considering they are not fully profitable. Yet Rocket Lab continues to grow its business, making more contracts, and it stands a competitive chance. If they can turn a profit within 2-3 years, I think they will be one hell of a company. With their competitors failing left and right and none finding the success as Rocket Lab‚Äîother than Space X‚Äîthey could stand to be a massive company in a few decades, so massive, they‚Äôre bigger than Earth.

One last financial point to touch upon‚Ä¶ shorting, so here is some data, which is roughly one month outdated due to my difficulty in finding up-to-date information on the company without a Bloomberg Terminal (So, if anyone on the sub has access to a Bloomberg Terminal and would like to add to my DD in the comments, please do).

**Last Record Date:** May 15, 2023

**Outstanding Shares:** 478,660,000 shares

**Float Size:** 262,310,000 shares

**Short Percent of Float:** 9.80% (The short percent of float represents the percentage of shares available for trading that have been sold short).

**Average Trading Volume:** 4,044,396 shares

**Current Short Volume:** 25,710,000 shares

**Previous Short Volume:** 24,630,000 shares

**Change Vs. Previous Month**: +4.38%

**Dollar Volume Sold Short:** $111.58 million

**Short Interest Ratio / Days to Cover:** 7.7 (This ratio indicates the number of days it would take for the short sellers to cover their positions based on the average daily trading volume.).

The short interest in Rocket Lab has increased from the previous month, with a change of +4.38%. The short percent of the float is 9.80%, indicating that a significant portion of the available shares for trading has been sold short. Now, Rocket Lab‚Äôs short interest is relatively low for a company that has had consistent negative EPS and revenue. Showcasing that the big players in markets either A) believe this company will make a massive turnaround in the near future (1-3 years mark) or B) Rocket Lab, due to its size, is thankfully not on their radar. However, that said, the off-exchange short percentage is 57.69%, showcasing that A) public on-exchange short volume is a complete hoax and Hedge Funds, and other big players are beating down on the stock or B) all of this information is completely misrepresented to retail traders on purpose and the entirety of the United States market system is a complete farce.

# Section 3: Future Prospects & Big Moves

Rocket Lab has demonstrated strong performance and growth potential in the emerging small satellite launch market. The company continues to refine its launch processes, aiming to increase launch frequency and reduce costs further. Additionally, Rocket Lab has plans to develop a larger reusable rocket called Neutron, targeting the medium-lift market segment, which would expand its capabilities and market reach. The company has the potential to be the go-to company for low Earth orbital launches in the short term and in the long term, one of, if not the go-to company, for transportation to the Moon, Mars, and Venus.

[Peter Beck, founder, and CEO of Rocket Lab, did an interview last month on his take on the industry and their future prospects. I wanted to touch briefly on this \(you can find the video on YouTube\).](https://preview.redd.it/mat09lfkpd4b1.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2e79c001150d884821e4146702932d27b59a72d)

Firstly, the video begins with the commentator stating, ""*With the Space Race this week*,"" the Space X rocket, the most powerful ever built, has scrubbed its launch. While Rocket Lab is adding a new service for testing hypersonic sub-orbital launches, being a welcome addition to the company‚Äôs wide array of services. Beck states that it is a very exciting time, stating that ‚Äú*the United States is kind of lacking behind in hypersonic technologies and this is a great opportunity to have high cadence, test flight environment for these payloads to really move forward the US‚Äôs hypersonic research*.‚Äù He goes on to talk about how these capabilities are essentially repurposed from Rocket Lab‚Äôs Electron Rocket capabilities: ‚Äú*We take a standard Electron orbital-class launch vehicle and we fly it in some really unique trajectories to provide these hypersonic trajectories‚Ä¶ it is taking an Electron and making a couple wee tweaks to it and having a great high frequency hypersonic testing platform that hasn‚Äôt existed*.‚Äù Beck goes on to speak on the launch cadence ‚Äú*being on target for 15 flights*‚Äù this year with the fastest turn around this year being 7 days between flights, saying ‚Äú*the machine is cranking and the vehicles are flying successfully and the last flight was a reusable vehicle and we splashed that down successfully and now we‚Äôre kind at the point where we are recycling and harvesting engines and components off of those launch vehicles and getting ready to put them back into service and re-fly them*.‚Äù He continues, stating, ‚Äú*I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm allowed to say exactly, but‚Ä¶ a whole multiple gambit of reused components that are all now re-entering the production line and going back into service*.‚Äù Morgan Brennan, the interviewer then speaks to how there is this emerging mismatch between supply and demand when it comes to the satellite launch market, with the fact that there are so many satellite constellations that are poised to go into orbit in the coming years and not enough capacity in terms of launching them. So, she then asks about the reusability of Electron and the development of the Neutron. Beck states that, ‚Äú*Electron is really serving that market very well, and there are lots of flight opportunities that are sort of just doing its thing, Neutron is the new flight opportunity for us‚Ä¶ 2026 to 2030 timeframe there is a massive deficit in launch and there are lots of constellations that are all really vying for an ability to get in orbit, so we saw that coming and started work on the vehicle and hopefully we can bring it into service in 2024 and really solve some of those problems and take advantage of that market opportunity*.‚Äù

Now, I don‚Äôt have to tell you all that this is very good to hear from Beck and this is very exciting, showcasing that he really believes Rocket Lab can penetrate this market and become a big player in the ever-evolving industry.

**Rocket Lab Making Big Moves Lately:**

¬∑ Bought Virgin Orbit HQ in California, this was a big win for the company, and folk on the sub were very excited to see this happen. Yay! But, sad and unfortunate for Virgin Galactic, which I am sure many of us space enthusiasts had higher hopes for, oh well, not everyone can achieve their dreams.

¬∑ Rocket Lab reached a new Company record of nine launches within a calendar year.

¬∑ Achieved a record of 100% mission success for Electron launches for the year.

¬∑ Successfully launched CAPSTONE mission to the Moon for NASA, including the first demonstration of Lunar Photon spacecraft platform.

¬∑ Successfully deployed two satellites to space for NASA‚Äôs TROPICS mission on the first of two dedicated launches on Electron for the constellation scheduled in May 2023.

¬∑ Secured another NASA mission to Electron‚Äôs 2023 launch manifest with its Starling mission. Rocket Lab was selected by NASA to launch the Starling mission on an expedited timeline due to long delays and uncertainty with the mission‚Äôs original launch provider.

¬∑ Signed multiple new launch contracts on Electron for 2023 for undisclosed commercial satellite customers previously manifested on another small launch vehicle, demonstrating Electron‚Äôs strong position as a reliable and dependable ride to orbit for small satellite operators.

¬∑ Introduced Rocket Lab‚Äôs new HASTE launch vehicle, a suborbital testbed launch vehicle derived from the Company‚Äôs Electron rocket to provide reliable, high-cadence flight test opportunities to support the development of advanced hypersonic systems technology.

¬∑ Announced that the Company will fly a pre-launched 3D printed Rutherford engine on an upcoming mission in Q3‚Äô23, a major step in evolving the Electron launch vehicle into a reusable rocket.

¬∑ Delivered financial results that exceeded the high end of prior guidance for revenue and gross margin.

¬∑ Launched three successful Electron missions in the first quarter for commercial constellation operators HawkEye 360, Capella Space, and BlackSky.

¬∑ Successfully completed the Company‚Äôs first launch from its U.S. launch site, Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2, at the Virginia Spaceport Authority‚Äôs Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on January 24, 2023. The mission deployed three satellites for radio frequency geospatial analytics provider HawkEye 360.

¬∑ Successfully completed the Company‚Äôs fastest turnaround between launches to date ‚Äì just seven days between its 34th Electron launch, ‚ÄúStronger Together‚Äù, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 in Virginia on March 16, 2023, and its 35th Electron launch, ‚ÄúThe Beat Goes On‚Äù, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand on March 24, 2023.

¬∑ Rocket Lab remains the only U.S. commercial small launch provider to successfully deliver satellites to orbit in 2023. Secured a multi-mission contract with Capella Space to launch four more dedicated launches on Electron in 2023.

¬∑ Achieved programmatic milestones for the Company‚Äôs two Photon spacecraft to support NASA‚Äôs ESCAPADE mission to Mars, and for the Photon spacecraft for a Varda Space Industries‚Äô mission to manufacture high-value products in zero gravity. Both Photon programs include Rocket Lab star trackers, reaction wheels, solar panels, flight software, and radios ‚Äì demonstrating the value and strength of the Company‚Äôs vertical integration and in-house supply chain.

# Conclusion: An Ode to Humanity's Future

Rocket Lab has established itself as a leading player in the small satellite launch market, offering dedicated launch services tailored to the needs of small satellite operators. The company's technological capabilities, solid customer base, and innovative approach position it well for future growth.

Those who lived and grew up in the 1960s and 1970s believed that by the 21st century, mankind would be a space-faring civilization. People had a fascination with the unknown. It was embedded in pop culture, in movies like the 2001 Space Odyssey, Alien, and the Star Trek series. But the unfortunate truth is that after Apollo 17 on the 19th of December 1972, mankind has not left low-earth orbit. The American public lost interest, the government cut funding, and the Saturn V rockets were dismantled and replaced by space shuttles in the 1980s (spaceships not even built to leave low-earth orbit). The curiosity and desire to unravel the mystery of the universe are now again filling the hearts of people. Technology is becoming more advanced and cheaper.

With companies like Rocket Lab and Space X, the future is looking bright. We currently live in an era of mass information. One of the hardest aspects of life in the early-21st-century is learning how to filter all this information. The news of the accomplishments of Rocket Lab, Space X, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA), the European Space Agency (ESA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Space Force, are lost in the large volume of collective data. The average person does not believe how close we are to colonizing Luna and Mars; how close we are to becoming a multi-planetary species. If you walked up to someone on the street of New York City, today, and told them that in the mid-2040s, and by the latest, the 2050s, there will be hundreds if not thousands of people living in Earth's orbit, the upper atmosphere of Venus, the Moon, and Mars, the person would dismiss you in disbelief. But the same would have happened if you walked up to a person on the street of New York City on the 19th of July 1962 (before Kennedy‚Äôs speech) and told them that mankind would step foot on the moon in seven years. Companies like Rocket Lab, which will make orbital flight and transportation affordable, will allow for a new era of civilization, one which was only present and dreamed of in science fiction of the past.

RKLB_posts.csv,In response to the bears (aka the liberal arts bull case for RKLB),"A few days ago I had an exchange with a guy who posted various pics Archimedes vs Raptor rockets.   A link to the thread ( https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/s/HOahYRJsur ), but the guy‚Äôs comments were deleted either by himself or the mods(?).  

In any event, it started out as just one of any number of posts going on about space x being so far ahead that nobody can compete.  I think the poster was a provocateur but also argued in good faith.  I found him to be broadly representative of a demographic of investor whose biases (technical snobbery and industry experience) are commonly found in arguments against Rocket Lab.  I think that those points are worth further discussion. 

I‚Äôm NOT an engineer (and this poster snidely pointed this out, in response to my comment that I don‚Äôt care about Archimedes looking like a wiry mess compared to Raptor).  I‚Äôm also not a quant of any type.  I focus on soft factors - culture, broad market structure, political and social movements.  I am a liberal arts shit head investor, and am proud to be one.  I was on NVIDIA in early 2022 (after many techies, yes,  but still before the market as a whole) because I read some novels about AI and read about GPT 3.  Not to toot my own horn, but focusing on soft factors like ‚Äúhow will other people perceive this technology?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhere are the potential bottlenecks in developing it?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat companies are critical to this but have relatively low overall public awareness?‚Äù were critical to pointing me to Nvidia.  Much of the same analysis points me to Rocket Lab.

‚ÄúRocket Lab is technically inferior to Space X‚Äù.  Nobody disputes this. I take it as a given.  There is a wide gulf.  But does it matter?  Only if the technological gap cannot be overcome in the long run.  Why would Space X have an insurmountable technological moat?  It could only be one of three reasons:

1. The tech is too hard to replicate
2. The talent for developing the tech will only be at Space X
3. Space X will drive its competitors out of business before they can attain technological parity. 

As to 1, this is not true.  Saturn V rockets have existed for like 50 years.  Building rockets is hard but it does not require any significant breakthrough in fundamental science to match Space X.  I think this is not controversial.  It‚Äôs a question of scaling, money, processes, quality control, not fundamental scientific knowledge. 

As to 2: the commenter argued something to the effect that given space X‚Äôs advantage, no engineer would want to work for RKLB. This , frankly , struck me as prime Boomer Logic.  We have seen time and again that top talent wants to take risks and get exposure to upside.  Yes many engineers like to work for a more established company, but many will simply want the challenge, glory, and financial rewards associated with working for start up (or in RKLBs case, a mature start up with room to run).  

As to 3: Beck himself often rightly points out that monopolies usually do not last in the long run.  While this is less true in extremely capital intensive industries , he is generally correct and his point is buttressed by 2 additional facts.  A) space is a national security issue and B) Space X is and must remain a privately held company ( if it is to continue to pursue its mars goal).

I asked the poster to tell me who controlled airplane manufacturing during World War 2.  He responded a small number of companies incestuously subcontracted with each other and later consolidated into a handful of mega contractors due to government intervention. He made my point for me.  Vital national defense concerns are never run by pure monopoly; oligopoly is the rule.  This is because the market is artificial.  The government cannot tolerate a single company having a chokehold on vital capacity such as launch and space systems manufacture.  It requires somewhat competitive bidding.  It requires redundancies.  It also requires its contractors to satisfy national security laws regarding sourcing, supply chain, secrecy, clearances, etc.  Rocket Lab has come farther than any of its direct competitors (other than, obviously, Space X) in terms of being able to satisfy the governments requirements and delivering a product that works as advertised.  At minimum, Rocket Lab can deliver components for other launch providers ; the best case is that it can be one of 3-4 major government contractors in terms of taking payloads into orbit. 

The private vs public structure is also quite important.  Public companies are subject to disclosure laws that do not apply to private companies.  Control is dispersed, not concentrated in one person or small group.  This is a superior governance structure for the purposes of winning public confidence and political support.  Space X cannot go public in the near term because its stated goal of going to Mars will be severely compromised by introducing any form of outside governance.  I do take Musk at his word; mars is THE objective. Thus, it must remain in the hands of an idiosyncratic billionaire with many political enemies.  All the more reason for US and world governments to foster competition and incubate alternatives. 

None of this is to say that rocket lab will come out as one of the favored group of competitors- it is still a long, hard road with a lot of risk.  But I do not buy the thesis that SpaceX is untouchable and I do believe that RKLB is one of the top contenders.",105,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1g8mmdo/in_response_to_the_bears_aka_the_liberal_arts/,0.9926,0.122,0.802,0.076

The Q1 2024 earnings call had only 2 of 23 questions relating to the Rocket Lab's military business despite the fact that more than half of value of all Rocket Lab's enforceable contracts (also known as the backlog) come from the US military and Rocket Lab is the DoD prime contract. Let's take a look at the Rocket Lab's military business.

This relationship started in 2009 with the launch of ƒÄtea-1, the Rocket Lab's very first rocket, from New Zealand. This launch impressed the United States Department of Defense's (DoD) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). **In 2010 DARPA invited Peter Beck, the Rocket Lab's founder and CEO, to meet with them, which resulted in a contract to develop** ""*a rocket-based system for flying a camera high into the sky at a moment's notice. The year was 2010, and commercial drones that could be chucked up into the air by schoolchildren did not yet exist.*"" The name of the project was ""**Instant Eyes**"". Rocket Lab's demo of this product for the DoD was in 2011 and it started to sell in 2012.

**Following DARPA's lead, Operationally Responsive Space Office (ORSO) and Office of Naval Research (ONR) funded more Rocket Lab's projects including the viscous liquid monopropellant (VLM)**. After successfully producing the VLM, **Rocket Lab took this even further by aiming to ""*****put it inside a Rocket Lab-made version of the US military's AIM-9 Sidewinder missile.*****""** Further according to Vance, the transition from the military rocket to Electron development went as follows: ""*DARPA initially gave Rocket Lab money to produce prototypes of the technology and then, liking what is saw, cut Rocket Lab another check to go ahead and fly the thing.* \[*...*\] *The following day, the test bolstered the case for those who had supported Beck.* ***Rocket Lab had hoped to build a machine that outperformed the US military's state-of-the-art technology - and it did exactly that.*** \[...\] *Not long after the demonstration, Beck held an all-hands meeting in Rocket Lab's tiny IRL office. A handful of twentysomethings watched as he unveiled what the company would do next.* \[...\] *He was going to fly to Silicon Valley, and he was not going to come back without a big bag of cash. Rocket Lab was going to make a real rocket.*""

In 2020, Michael Griffith has joined the Board of Directors: ""***Griffin served as Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, overseeing the establishment of the Space Development Agency (SDA)****. In this role he was responsible for research, development, and prototyping activities across the DoD enterprise, mandated with ensuring technological superiority for the Department of Defense. He also oversaw the activities of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Missile Defense Agency, the Defense Innovation Unit, the Strategic Capabilities Office, the DoD Laboratory enterprise, and the Under Secretariate staff focused on developing advanced technology and capability for the U.S. military. Griffin also served as the 11th NASA Administrator, a role in which he initiated the first development of commercial cargo delivery service to Earth orbit in the agency‚Äôs history.*""

In 2021, United States Space Force Space¬†Systems¬†Command (SSC) awarded $24 million to Rocket Lab for the Neutron's upper stage development. Rocket Lab commented on that as follows: ""***awarding of this contract recognizes Rocket Lab as a potential NSSL Phase 3 Launch provider from 2025***"".

In 2023, Lt. Gen. Nina Armagno, former United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Space Force (USSF), has joined the Board of Directors: ""***Lt. Gen. Armagno joins the Rocket Lab Board after serving more than 35 years in leadership positions for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force***. During her service in the U.S. Armed Forces, ***she served as the Director of Plans & Policy for the U.S. Strategic Command*** *and as* ***the Director for Space Programs at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Acquisition for the Air Force***. She was the first lieutenant general officer appointed to, and Director of Staff for, the Space Force where she established the first new military branch in 72 years, ***before retiring from active duty in July 2023***. ***She had previously commanded the 30******^(th)******and 45******^(th)***¬†***Space Wings, the 21******^(st)***¬†***Operations Group, and the 6******^(th)***¬†***Space Warning Squadron.***""

In 2024, New Zealand got unilaterally included under the military trade law without New Zealand even knowing about it, which may release Rocket Lab's stuff from ITAR restrictions? Here' the excerpt from the article: ""*The US has included New Zealand under a military trade law that exists to ""support \[the\] national security objectives of the United States"" - without the New Zealand government's involvement.* \[...\] *The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the US Congress acted on its own initiative.* \[...\] *The US Embassy spokesperson said the process of amending the law was transparent. Including New Zealand ""allowed the continuation of existing technological cooperation, and... also ensured that developing bilateral space cooperation was possible"", they said. A Congress explainer said the NTIB was about ""supplying military operations; conducting advanced R&D and systems development to ensure technological superiority of the US Armed Forces; securing reliable sources of critical materials; and developing industrial preparedness to support operations in wartime or during a national emergency"". Members have been involved in F-35 joint strike fighter programme and the Pentagon is only allowed to buy satellite ""star trackers"" and certain naval components from approved NTIB manufacturers. Dual-use technologies that also have non-military uses are a focus.* \[...\] *He told RNZ he was not surprised New Zealand got added without fanfare to the NTIB. ""I sincerely doubt there were any discussions with your government before Congress acted,"" he said by email. ""The idea in essence is that if we can trust these countries with some of the US most significant secrets, we should also be able to trust them with less stringent security information about weapon systems development, production and operations. New Zealand probably registered little change, he said. However, aligning the NTIB with Five Eyes had helped* ***the US Congress accept the rationale of giving its allies a break from export controls***, a move required to implement the Aukus pact, Greenwalt said.""

The above has happened after the USSF SSC assessed New Zealand's (i.e. Rocket Lab's) capability to help with rapid rocket and satellite launches if war breaks out in space: ""*The United States has been assessing New Zealand's capability to help with rapid rocket and satellite launches if war breaks out in space. US Space Command has also asked New Zealand to join an international operation to deter space-enabled attack, focused on China and Russia.* \[...\] *Congressional records showed the US Congress ordered the Secretaries of Defence and State last year to produce ""an assessment of the benefits of leveraging allied and partner spaceports for responsive launch. New Zealand launches more rockets than any other US ally in the Five Eyes intelligence group. It is in an elite group of five regular successful rocket launch countries, along with the US, China, Russia and India.* \[...\] ***A ""responsive"" launch - as referred to by Congress - was a rapid one ""during a conflict or a crisis"", according to Rocket Lab.*** *To test this, the NZ-US company is due to put up a satellite next year that will chase another company's satellite, under a $50m Pentagon contract to ""showcase the ability to maneuver from a real-time threat"". While New Zealand had no military launch capability, the NZDF had just set up a ground-based Pacific ""cell"" at the US's invitation, to monitor civilian and military satellite activity. Documents say this was partly to guard against a surprise space-enabled attack on US assets.* \[...\] ***The Pentagon was poised ""to sign agreements with commercial space companies that go far beyond the usual contractor relationships"" to embed private sector equipment into military units***, a US space website reported this week. The 2023 report to Congress was also aimed to assess US plans to engage with allies over such things as repairing or augmenting satellites, and an assessment of what shared costs and technology ""could be considered for allied spaceports"". The US Embassy did not address those ""shared costs"", nor did it address the invite to New Zealand to join the US-led international Operation Olympic Defender.""

Let's take a look at space systems and Electron/HASTE launches with military payloads (i.e. excluding national non-military payloads such as NASA's payloads) and other relating information to date, which I've been able to find\*:

2010

* DARPA's Instant Eyes

* DARPA's classified rocket using VLM

2019:

* 5th Electron launch - Northrop Grumman's payload for DARPA's R3D2.
* 6th Electron launch - US Air Force's Rapid Agile Launch Initiative (RALI)

2020:

* 11th Electron launch - National Reconnaissance Office's (NRO) Rapid Acquisition of a Small Rocket (RASR) contract launch (NROL-151) and UNSW Canberra Space/Royal Australian Air Force's M2 Pathfinder
* **Michael Griffin joins the Board of Directors**

* New Zealand included under the US military trade law

If supposed analysts were familiar with established relations between the DoD and Rocket Lab, would they still ask Rocket Lab, the DoD prime contractor with the fresh $515 million SDA contract, whether the Baltimore bridge incident had an impact on their business (none), if their $565 million in cash includes net proceeds of the recent capital raise (what else could it be?) or what is the Rocket Lab's runway (that's actually an insult to the fresh DoD prime contractor) instead of diligently poking around the Rocket Lab's military business and their lobbying? Analysts' questions suggest the lack of awareness of what's going on inside Rocket Lab's business segment, which comprises more than 60% of value of their enforceable contracts (aka backlog in the language of Rocket Lab).

\*I might have missed some information related to the Rocket Lab's military business segment. If you know them, feel free to mention them in the comments below. I read all your comments.

RKLB_posts.csv,Rocket Lab Acquisition / Constellation Analysis,"# Hey r/RKLB, just wanted to share some analysis I've been doing on potential acquisition targets.

Rocket Lab's track record with acquisitions follows a fairly well-defined pattern. Let's take a look at the companies they have purchased thus far:

* **SolAero Technologies** - $80m - Dec '21 - Provider of high performance solar panels - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-space-solar-power-products-company-solaero-holdings-inc/)
* **Planetary System Corp (PSC)** - $42m + 1.7m shares - Dec '21 - Provider of separation systems - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-space-hardware-company-planetary-systems-corporation/)
* **Advanced Solutions Inc (ASI)** - $40m - Oct '21 - Flight software, mission sim, and guidance + nav software - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-acquires-space-software-company-advanced-solutions-inc/)
* **Sinclair Interplanetary** - $ Unknown - Apr - '20 - Satellite components (reaction wheels, star trackers, etc) - [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-of-satellite-hardware-manufacturer-sinclair-interplanetary/)

Here is a section of an interview with CEO Peter Beck explaining the methodology behind Rocket Lab's acquisitions: [https://youtu.be/T\_\_1ubfs\_iE?t=1313](https://youtu.be/T__1ubfs_iE?t=1313)

* ""If the supply chain can not provide us the surety to deliver what we need, then we‚Äôll go and vertically integrate""
* ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs too expensive and it‚Äôs too slow, generally we need to own it because we can make it cheaper and faster‚Äù
* ""Is this going to be strategically important to us in the future for stuff that we think we're going to do""

To summarize, Rocket Lab's acquisitions have all been vertical integration plays; bringing some aspect of their supply chain in house to either reduce lead times, unit cost, or both. Peter has mentioned in multiple interviews that all of these companies have scaled and integrated successfully into Rocket Lab's business.

Note how most of these acquisitions support the production and manufacturing of satellite **buses**. A quick review: satellites can be described as being comprised of a **bus** and a **payload.**

**Bus** - the main structure and infrastructure of a satellite, providing the necessary support systems for the payload to operate effectively. It includes power, structure, solar panels, propulsion, thermal control, attitude control, communication, and on-board computer systems.

**Payload** - the primary instrumentation or equipment on a satellite that performs the specific mission or function, such as sensing, communication, or experimentation, and is the reason the satellite is launched into space.  
  

Rocket Lab can currently produce satellite buses quickly, cost effectively, and at scale. Payloads? Not so much. 

# I think Rocket Lab's next acquisition will be a payload company. A company that specializes communications equipment, imaging/sensors, etc.

It's been clearly communicated by leadership that Rocket Lab plans on building a LEO constellation. If/when they do announce an acquisition of a payload company, we will be able to make some pretty big assumptions about the type of constellation they will build.

I do not think Rocket Lab will build out a direct to consumer mega constellation a la Starlink or Kuiper based on the following:

* Starlink's original estimated cost to design, build and deploy was $10 Billion  [source](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/05/block-5-spacex-increase-launch-cadence-lower-prices/)
* Amazon reportedly invested $10 Billion in the Kuiper project in 2020 [source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/fcc-authorizes-amazon-to-build-kuiper-satellite-internet-network.html)
* Comments from CFO Adam Spice :

>""the broadband from space application that SpaceX targeted with Starlink, that's probably not what we will be going for just given the amount of capital required"" [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=1059)

>""but there's lots of very interesting applications that required dozens or hundreds of satellites not 40 thousand satellites"" [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=1070)

While it's possible they could pursue a smaller 5G constellation similar to AST SpaceMobile, I think AST's tech moat is wide enough that other opportunities make more sense.

# I think it's likely that we see a smaller 100-200 satellite constellation purpose built and marketed towards military applications.

These satellites could provide access to a suite of sensors, communication systems, radar, antennas, etc., and deliver tailored services to DoD customers. A few points supporting that:

* Rocket Lab is prime DoD contractor as of Dec '23, acting as prime for the $515m SDA Tranche 2 Transport Layer - Beta contract. According to Adam Spice this:

>""opens up a lot of opportunities for us"" .. ""we think it's a huge enabler to grow that government exposure"".  [source](https://youtu.be/qHHv7QPe5Fg?t=515)

* Sitting Board member Nina Armagno, among many other things, **was the first director of staff of the United States Space Force** and was responsible for helping to establish the organizational framework, policies and procedures, building relationships with other branches, etc.  [source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/about/team/)
* The business is already heavily focused on gov customers. SDA, ESCAPADE, HASTE, CAPSTONE, TROPICS, etc, all make up a huge chunk of rocket lab's revenue already.

# Ok. So if it's likely that the acquisition is a payload company, and it's likely that the payload would be for a constellation built for servicing DoD customers, I think I know where to look...

# [Here is a list of subcontractors that Rocket Lab selected to help fulfill the SDA contract](https://spaceimpulse.com/2024/05/07/rocket-lab-selects-subcontractors-for-sda-satellite-constellation/#:~:text=The%20selected%20subcontractors%20include%20CesiumAstro,Redwire%20Space%2C%20and%20Parsons%20Corporation)

What do you know, a bunch of **payload** companies (mostly).

* **CesiumAstro** - $260-390m [source](https://app.dealroom.co/companies/cesiumastro) - will provide its Vireo active electronically scanned array (AESA) radio frequency (RF) communications payload, known as the first multi-beam-capable Ka-band communications system for SDA‚Äôs PWSA.
* **Mynaric** - $93m Mkt Cap - will supply CONDOR Mk3 optical communication terminals, enhancing free space optical communications for air, space, and mobile applications.
* **Redwire Space** - 450m Mkt Cap - has been chosen for its expertise in antennas and RF hardware.
* **Parsons Corp** - 10b Mkt Cap - will provide the NEBULA Operations ‚Äì Vendor Architecture (NOVA), serving as Rocket Lab‚Äôs ground system for the operational management of its 18 satellites.
* **SEAKR Engineering** - Acquired by Raytheon - will offer its Tactical Satellite Communications (TACSATCOM) Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Network Encryption System (NES).
* **Collins Aerospace** - Acquired by Safran Group - ¬†is set to deliver the waveform necessary for the SDR, essential software and firmware for TACSATCOM‚Äôs transmission and reception.

# Cash Situation

Rocket Lab's current Cash and Equivalents and marketable securities etc is $546.8m ([source - slide 37](https://s28.q4cdn.com/737637457/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/FINAL-Rocket-Lab-Q2-2024-Earnings-Presentation.pdf))

All the previous acquisitions have been in the $40-80m range (Sinclair likely less)

Adam Spice gave guidance in the Q2 '24 earnings call that capex for Neutron R&D was expected to tick up in the in the second half of 2024 [source](https://youtu.be/lE9SPN_bIhc?t=3634)

Adam Spice on whether they would do another cap raise - ""Right now we don't see anything that would cause us to go back to capital markets"" but did provide a caveat that for the right opportunity, it's a possibility [source](https://youtu.be/lE9SPN_bIhc?t=5751)

So it's not likely they would raise capital for an acquisition, but it's also not off the table.

Obviously the last three subcontractors on the list aren't an option, and $450m for Redwire seems a bit steep given the cash on hand. **Mynaric** and **CesiumAstro** both fit the profile and around the price range we are looking for.

Do I think one of these companies will be acquired by Rocket Lab? **I don't know**.

Do I think a company *like* Mynaric or CesiumAstro will be acquired by Rocket Lab? **Yes.**

Here's a few predictions:

* I think the first constellation Rocket Lab builds will be less than 200 satellites
* I think it will be purpose built to serve the DoD, possibly partnering with a branch to actually fund the first tranche of satellites
* If there is an acquisition, I feel very confident that it will be a payload company
* Without a cap raise, I think $100m is the most we could afford to spend on an acquisition (assuming no Neutron delays etc)

RKLB_posts.csv,Here's my take on Apple's $1.5 billion investment and the impact it could have on RKLB,"***\\!/ This is not financial advice \\!/***

For those who aren't aware already, Apple has just announced on Friday a $1.5 billion satellite investment with Globalstar to improve space-based communications for iPhones. The deal is expected to close on Nov. 5.

Here is all the information I could find in order to form a realistic expectation on the effects such a deal could have on RKLB.

First things first, Globalstar is the company with which Apple has been partnering with since 2022 to offer emergency services on its latest iPhones when terrestrial networks are unavailable. Globalstar is managing the constellation Apple uses to provide that service. It is specified in the deal that Apple will make cash payments of $1.1 billion to help Globalstar fund the new network of satellites but, it is also said that SpaceX is expected to begin launching those new satellites next year. It is important to note that Globalstar's constellation is in LEO (low-earth orbit) and that  their network does not \*yet\* provide more bandwidth-hungry services such as voice and broadband as of today.

**Back to 2022's subcontract with MDA:**

RocketLab is directly involved in Globalstar's ""old"" constellation because in 2022, RKLB was awarded a subcontract by MDA ""to¬†lead the design and manufacture of 17 spacecraft buses for Globalstar‚Äôs new Low Earth Orbit satellites"". MDA is the company that initially got the contrat to build those 17 new satellites. Rocket Lab is also developing the Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC) for the constellation. The Globalstar SOCC includes a continuous satellite control and monitoring using Rocket Lab‚Äôs MAX GDS, a constellation-class ground software solution that provides complete spacecraft command and control. What is also important to note is that the telemetry and control radio for all spacecraft will also be a C-band variant of Rocket Lab‚Äôs Frontier Satellite Radio (Frontier-C). Rocket Lab's Frontier Satellite Radios are Software-defined radio (SDR). SDRs are a radio communication system where components that conventionally have been implemented in analog hardware (e.g. mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, etc.) are instead implemented by means of software on a computer or embedded system. 

**What are spacecraft buses?:**

Spacecraft buses can be referred to as satellite platforms which are the support on which to mount instruments and the infrastructure for the mission such as power, communications to the ground and navigation. A spacecraft bus consists of everything needed to¬†transport, protect, and operate the payload. In our case, RKLB was in charge of the manufacturing of the satellite platforms in the 2022 contract and MDA was in charge of the payload which is the primary function of the satellite's mission. 

**MDA's new Aurora satellites:**

MDA announced their new Aurora satellite line in March 2024. Aurora is a new software-defined satellite product line which is basically a transition from analog to digital satellite technology. MDA has also made new partnerships with new companies to supply components for Aurora. 

Here's a list of a few partnerships I could find: 

1. Aerospacelab announced July 8, 2024 that it will provide more than 200 battery charge regulators for MDA Space‚Äôs Aurora satellites over a three-year period starting in 2026. These components are used to manage power distribution and battery charging in satellite systems. 
2. Airbus will supply more than 200 Sparkwing solar arrays that will be built on a designated line at Airbus' high-capacity production facility in Leiden, the Netherlands.
3. Switzerland‚Äôs Huber+Suhner was selected to supply more than 60,000 multi-channel radio frequency (RF). 

The list above refers to components that are used in the manufacturing of a satellite platform/satellite bus. If MDA was still using RKLB's satellite platforms, why would they buy components which are generally used for the making of the satellite platform and not the payload? 

Also, SDR setup involves an RF front-end connected to a computer that will perform the conversions from analog to digital. In other words and from my understanding, multi-channel radio refrequency (RF) is a component used in the making of a Software-defined radio (SDR). If MDA was still using RKLB's SDRs, why would they buy multi-channel frequency systems from another supplier? 

Obviously, I'm not an aerospace engineer or anywhere near that job industry, but prior to the launch of their new Aurora line, I personally think MDA needed RKLB's SDR to actually make their precedent satellite line ""Software-defined"". Since they've now developed their own fully software-defined satellite line, it doesn't seem like they'd still use RKLB's components. Also, the latest contracts for Aurora satellites do not mention any partnership with RKLB. In fact, MDA's press release in August 2023 about their contract with Telesat briefly mentions a new line of satellite and a transition from analog to software-defined satellites. It also seems like, by the recent partnerships MDA made for Aurora's components, that MDA is now making their very own satellite buses also. 

**From all the information above, here's what I think:**

1. It doesn't seem like RKLB is going to be the launch provider since SpaceX is already slated to begin launches in 2025. 
2. In November 2023, MDA received an Authorization to Proceed (ATP) contract from an undisclosed customer to start work on a new Non-Geostationary Orbit (NGSO) satellite constellation (valued at $180 million). The definitive contract for the full constellation (valued at around $750 million) is expected in 2024. We can hope for the unnamed customer to be linked to Apple's new investment since the contract and the constellation' valuations both make sense, price wise, with the total investment made by Apple's and the $1.1 billion payments that will be made to Globalstar in order to help them fund the new constellation. The timeline between the ATP with MDA and Apple's announcement for their new investment also both make sense. However, if that contract actually turns out to be tied to Apple's new investment, I'm not really optimistic on the fact that Rocket Lab is still involved in the spacecraft bus manufacturing.
3. Because Apple's main objective with their new investment is to improve space-based communications for iPhones, I see this new investment as an extension to their first partnership with Globalstar back in 2022. That being said, I think it would make sense if Globalstar continues to use Rocket Lab's constellation-class ground software for their new satellite constellation because from my understanding, the new constellation's purpose is to act as a complement to the one currently operated. 
4. Globalstar didn't want to elaborate on the upgrades their new constellation would bring to space-based communications on iPhones. By looking at RKLB's old press releases about the 2022 contract, I've found this very precise sentence: ""These new satellites and SOCC will augment Globalstar‚Äôs existing constellation delivering reliable mobile satellite voice and data services from space."" However, Globalstar's current constellation does not \*yet\* provide more bandwidth-hungry services such as voice and broadband as of today. Is it possible that the new satellites partly built by RKLB would provide such an upgrade to GlobalStar's currently offered services? 

I'd like to know what you guys think and feel free to share your opinion! 

Once again, this is not financial advice and this message only reflects my own thoughts after doing my very own DD. I do own shares of the company because I like the stock.

3 Millionaire-Maker Space Stocks

Historically, space exploration and putting satellites into orbit has been within the purview of government-funded agencies like NASA.

That's changing, though. For-profit corporations can handle this work at least as cost-effectively as government-run organizations can. Elon Musk's SpaceX recently facilitated the world's first-ever private citizen spacewalk, for example, while Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is mainstreaming space tourism. Blue Origin's newest rocket will even soon be launching two Mars probes for NASA.

This is only the beginning of privatized work in outer space, now that technology not only allows for it, but necessitates it. Market research outfits Polaris and Precedence agree that launch services alone will be roughly a $50 billion-per-year business within a decade. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley and Citi both predict that the entirety of the science, technology, and services businesses linked to space will be worth on the order of $1 trillion by 2040.

Connect the dots. There's real investment opportunity here.

The top opportunities, however, aren't likely to be the obvious names. The potential millionaire-making space stocks are likely to be the lower-profile stocks that could even be considered a little off the radar. Here's a closer look at three of your better bets among such prospects.



Rocket Lab USA

It may not be a household name, but Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ: RKLB) has been very busy for quite some time now. Since its very first launch in May 2017, this company has put over 190 satellites into orbit. Its technology (like software, solar panels, radios, etc.) is also found inside more than 1,700 different satellites, as well as the James Webb Space Telescope. The two aforementioned Mars probes will also be flying with Rocket Lab tech on board.

While there's a clear market for satellite launches, Rocket Lab's been at it for a while. For any ticker to offer real millionaire-making potential, the company must mostly be undiscovered. That, or it needs to be doing something new that most investors don't yet fully appreciate. In this case it's the latter.

To date, all of this company's launches have utilized its so-called Electron rocket. It's perfectly fine for putting small satellites into orbit, but it's not powerful enough to lift larger satellites, exploration craft, or people into space.

That's coming, though. The Neutron rocket expected to start flying next year will be a so-called medium-lift vehicle capable of carrying bigger machinery. In fact, it will even be able to provide the initial liftoff for missions to Mars and Venus. The Neutron rocket will also be reusable, making it cost-effective for the company as well as its customers. Perhaps most important, the soon-to-launch Neutron rocket will provide real competition to SpaceX, which currently dominates the medium-lift market.

And interest is definitely firming up even before its first commercial flight. The U.S. Space Force has already provided funding to co-develop an upper stage of Rocket Lab's Neutron rocket as part of the Department of Defense's efforts to ensure it's able to secure and defend the United States wherever and however it needs to.



AST SpaceMobile

AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ: ASTS) isn't nearly as far along as Rocket Lab USA is on the commercialization front. In fact, the company only recently launched its first-ever commercial satellites. These certainly won't be the last, however, now that the underlying technology has been proven and perfected.

It's not an apples-to-apples comparison. Whereas Rocket Lab designs tech for others' satellites as well as a means of putting them into orbit, as the name implies, AST SpaceMobile offers mobile broadband connectivity via satellites rather than cellphone towers. This tech is capable of connecting anyone to the worldwide web regardless of where they are -- no physical infrastructure (other than a functioning, web-capable phone) required.

At first blush, it seems like a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. You likely don't have any trouble connecting to the web, whether that be with your phone or a computer. That's not necessarily the norm, however, and that line of thinking underestimates a growing challenge.

See, as the world becomes increasingly connected -- including our cars -- our telecom infrastructure is being pushed to its limits. Much of the developed world is now running low on radio frequencies to assign to mobile phones and cell towers. Offloading this data traffic to fiberoptic connections has certainly helped, but handling such constant switchovers en masse can be technically complex as well, and still won't fully meet future needs.

There's also the not-so-small matter that such connectivity frameworks are vulnerable to power outages and other sorts of disruption.

Satellite-based connectivity, however, sidesteps many of those problems. It's not exactly a new idea, either. Even if not always practical or affordable for the average consumer, satellite-driven mobile phone connectivity has been around since the 90s.

Now that it's practical as well as affordable, Polaris Market Research believes this market is poised to grow at an average annual pace of 18% through 2032. AST SpaceMobile is smack-dab in the middle of this mainstreaming movement.


Intuitive Machines

Last but not least, add Intuitive Machines (NASDAQ: LUNR) to your list of space-related stocks that could turn out to be millionaire makers.

In some ways, Intuitive Machines is the riskiest of the three stocks in question simply due to its small size and young age. Its market capitalization is a mere $375 million, and while it's now producing annual revenue in the same ballpark following its founding in 2013, it's also still operating in the red with only a little over $30 million worth of cash in the bank.

In other ways, though, Intuitive Machines is arguably the least risky of these three stocks just because it's also operating the most practical, currently marketable business. Simply put, this company is helping for-profit organizations and government agencies get back to the Moon. Whether that's drones that land on the Moon to map it or a means of putting communication satellites in a lunar orbit, Intuitive Machines has a solution.

It's prescient, too, given that the Moon has moved back into focus as the world's next space-exploration point of interest, perhaps as a place to mine or colonize, or perhaps as a test run for a manned mission to Mars.

Indeed, NASA's Artemis rocket designed specifically to return mankind to the Moon is still slated to do so sometime in the latter part of 2025 or 2026. This voyage will partially be made possible with the help Intuitive Machines has already provided and will provide in the future. The company recently announced a $117 million contract to deliver six different payloads to the Moon for NASA.

This is still just the beginning. Analysts believe growing interest in Moon trips will drive enough revenue growth for Intuitive Machines to push it out of the red and into the black by 2026. Reaching that milestone could easily send this stock on a rocket ride, so to speak.

Rocket Lab Stock Soars. Space Has Momentum.

Commercial space company Rocket Lab RKLB 12.58% posted stronger quarterly sales Thursday evening, sending shares soaring. Rocket Lab, like Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX, has space launch and satellite-building capabilities. SpaceX, of course, is dominant, launching almost 80 times so far in 2024. Rocket Lab has launched nine times. Investors don‚Äôt get regular quarterly updates from Musk‚Äôs privately held space company. That isn‚Äôt the case with publicly traded Rocket Lab. For the second quarter, Rocket Lab reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, of negative $21 million from sales of just over $106 million. Wall Street was looking for an Ebitda loss of $26 million from sales of just under $106 million. Better cost control, resulting in a smaller-than-expected loss, is a positive. So are higher sales. Rocket Lab‚Äôs second-quarter sales grew about 15% compared with the first quarter and more than 70% year over year. The results sent Rocket Lab shares up about 12.6% in Friday trading to $5.37 apiece. The S&P 500 SPX 0.47% and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA 0.13% gained 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively. Following the report, Stifel analyst Erik Rasmussen wrote that launch demand remains strong and that sales should jump higher in the fourth quarter following relatively flat third-quarter sales of between $100 and $105 million. Rasmussen projects $121 million in fourth-quarter sales, up more than 100% year over year. He projects 2025 sales of about $576 million, up 36% from expected 2024 sales. Rasmussen projects positive Ebitda for the company in 2026, after sales hit almost $1 billion. He rates Rocket Lab shares Buy and has a $9 price target for the stock. Through Friday trading, Rocket Lab shares were down about 4% year to date.Shares of space start-up Virgin Galactic SPCE 2.16% are down about 87% this year, despite a 14% jump on Thursday. The company reported second-quarter sales of $4.2 million on Wednesday evening. Wall Street was looking for $3.4 million. Galactic focuses, of course, on space tourism. While better-than-expected sales are positive, ramping up capacity has been harder than the company expected. Rocket Lab has had more success providing launch services for companies looking to deploy small satellites into low-earth orbit. Coming into Friday trading, Galactic‚Äôs market capitalization was below $200 million. Rocket Lab‚Äôs was north of $2.3 billion. SpaceX dwarfs them both. It‚Äôs valued at some $200 billion in private markets.

_____________________________________________________

Rocket Lab had another successful launch this morning.   Just watched them successfully deploy the Capella satellite.  I think we see $10 by the end of the year.  I also think there might be more consolidation in the space industry.  Everyone knows that to compete with Musk you have to grow as fast as possible.  I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see more U.S. government contracts announced for Rocket Lab.  Boeing has really dropped the ball with leaving the astronauts stuck in space.  They are not getting any contracts until they bring them home unless one of their paid servants in congress really pushes for more money for Boeing.  If two of the big companies don‚Äôt combine in the next 12 months I‚Äôll be surprised.  ",97,48,https://i.redd.it/rgqb4oh2o1id1.jpeg,0.9891,0.099,0.87,0.032

7:48 am ET August 9, 2022 (Dow Jones)

By Jon Sindreu

This column is part of the sixth annual Heard on the Street stock-picking contest.

Investors in 2022 have decided they hate moonshots. They should make an exception for a firm that has actually gone to the moon.

On Thursday, a spy satellite run by the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office shot into space from New Zealand. The rocket carrying it, the Electron, was built by Rocket Lab, a U.S.-Kiwi startup founded in 2006 by self-taught rocket engineer Peter Beck.

Shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, satellite-intelligence firm BlackSky asked Rocket Lab for an orbit change just days before it was due to launch, in or der to place its satellites more directly over the conflict zone. While changing such missions has traditionally taken months, Rocket Lab pulled it off in 45 days.

These are examples of the new opportunities opened up by governments' desire for ""responsive launch."" While Elon Musk's SpaceX has spent years revolutionizing the space economy with its large reusable Falcon rockets, a raft of startups have recently stepped in to provide light rockets that are more expensive in terms of price per kilogram, but can send small satellites to specific orbits with extremely fast turnaround times.

Geopolitical tensions could expand this market at warp speed as part of a broad-based defense upgrade. After devoting $50 million to responsive launch within the Pentagon's 2022 budget, lawmakers have pushed to increase this funding to $150 million for 2023. Russia's Soyuz rocket no longer being available to Western governments and firms further brightens the picture for launchers.

Yet investors are dumping their stocks. After a year of unrestrained euphoria, when all sorts of ""pre-revenue"" startups merged with special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, rising interest rates have prompted traders to shun speculative ventures, including fintech innovations, air taxis and, yes, small-satellite launchers.

This has shrouded Rocket Lab, Virgin Orbit and Astra Space, which all went public through SPACs last year, in a cloud of negative sentiment. It also casts doubt over the fate of privately owned ventures like Firefly Aerospace, Relativity Space and ABL Space Systems.

Shares in Rocket Lab are down more than 50% this year, which is in line with the fall for the AXS De-SPAC Exchange Traded Fund. But this is galactically unfair: Unlike many of the companies in that fund, Rocket Lab has actually achieved the impressive feats it promised to investors.

Beyond launching 149 satellites into space so far, Rocket Lab also sent NASA's CAPSTONE spacecraft on its way to the moon's orbit in June. A month earlier, it caught an Electron booster in midair with a helicopter -- a key step toward making the rocket reusable. For comparison's sake, Astra has suffered a number of failed launches over the past year, Firefly's Alpha rocket exploded during its first test launch, and Relativity has yet to attempt one.

This may actually understate Rocket Lab's manufacturing edge.

""Your first rocket is built by engineers in a controlled environment over years,"" Mr. Beck said. ""Your 20th rocket is built by a technician reading instructions and it's all about process.""

Furthermore, this isn't really a ""pre-revenue"" company: Sales came in at $41 million in the first quarter, a 124% on-the-year increase. It isn't yet profitable -- positive operating income is expected in 2024 -- but only because it continues to invest heavily in a larger coming rocket called the Neutron. And its business isn't just launches: Between two-thirds and three-quarters of revenues actually come from building satellite components.

When investors finally come around to discriminating between former SPACs, they may realize that Rocket Lab has long achieved escape velocity.

Overall the movie is great, but not a ‚Äúrocket lab‚Äù movie. It mostly covers Astra and honestly pulls no punches when talking about their failures. It also covers Planet a good bit. After Astra‚Äôs failures it cuts back to Rocket Lab doing their thing.

RKLB_posts.csv,Neutron and a constellation isn't the end of the story,"While discussing planning a trip to VA to watch the first Neutron launch with my 12 year old son (who is very interested in space and investing), he asked an interesting question. He asked me ""What comes after Neutron and Rocket Labs constellation? What's next? Do they just stop there and run Neutron like a satellite school bus from then on?""

I don't know the answer, but the first thought that came to mind was ""Peter Beck will figure that out when the time comes.""

Neutron and a mega constellation, along with a thriving space systems business, is a ways away. That's the carrot at the end of the stick. Even so, that can't be the end of the story. I find it difficult to believe that is as far as it goes.

Rocket Lab's proposal is included in the body of the above document (which I cannot post the link to because this sub doesn't allow links for some reason), and it does not appear in the original list of the 7 selected companies.

It's not exactly a smoking gun, but with just under 6 weeks between RL's proposal being accepted and Nelson saying that, it doesn't take a lot of squinting to see that there is a reasonable likelihood that Nelson is referring to Rocket Lab's new proposal which leverages every single unique mission they've ever done as a resume. For a bid of $2b and sample return by NLT Sept '33, this is incredibly ambitious for RL, I think it will be incredibly difficult to pull it off, but I'd be ecstatic to see it happen.

How it's not worth $5B today because it doesn't have the revenues to support that valuation. These posters are missing the point. You, I, analysts, pundits, space enthusiasts, or market experts don't decide what a stock is worth. Only the market decides what stocks are ""worth"". And currently it's saying that RKLB is worth 5B today not because of what it's actually intrinsically worth, but because that the chance of it being worth 25, 50, 100B+ in a few years is becoming more and more likely.

A lottery ticket is a piece of paper worth nothing intrinsically. You don't buy it for the value of the paper. You buy it because it comes with the opportunity for it to later actually be worth a large amount of money.

It's fine if you want to trade RKLB and try and call the tops and bottoms.

RKLB_posts.csv,"A multi billion contract with Amazon - Rocket Lab is supplying 12Nms reaction wheels to the Amazon's megaconstellation of 3,236 satellites, (3 to) 4 wheels per each satellite, (9,708 to) 12,944 12Nms reaction wheels with more required for maintenance and replacement","While the CEO spoke about 2,000 reaction wheels for a single customer this year, that Amaz...ing customer will eventually need 12,944\* 12Nms reaction wheels just to get the constellation into the space and then further thousands of reaction wheels for the maintenance and replacement.

If Amazon got a discount in the range of 10-30%, let's say 20% for purposes of this dive, this deal would translate into revenues between $1.035 billion and $1.242 billion, depending on the type of 12Nms reaction wheels. Further revenues would follow from reaction wheels sold for the maintenance and replacement of deorbited satellites.

There is no way that this deal is in the backlog in its entirety as the $1 billion backlog already comprises the $515 million SDA T2TL-Beta deal, $215 million in Electron launches, $143 million Apple/MDA deal, $32 million Victus Haze deal (this also includes launch, so I've deducted 8.5 million below), $30 million out of $150 million deal for solar cells for the space prime contractor and also deals with other Rocket Lab's customers (as ""x"" below).

515+215+143+23.5 + 30 + x = 926.5 + x

1014 (total backlog) - 926.5 (known backlog) - x (unknown backlog) = **87.5 - x**

**I don't see how can the deal for over 2,000 reaction wheels this year, which may be for $160 or $192 million, not even speaking about more than $1 billion for 12,944 reaction wheels for the whole constellation, be already comprised in less than $87.5 million of unidentified deals in the current backlog. It may be possible that only a very small portion of this deal is in the backlog.**

The FCC has given Amazon the deadline of July 2026 to launch 50% of the constellation, that is 1,618 satellites, which require 6,472\* 12Nms reaction wheels. These reaction wheels need to be delivered to Amazon well before July 2026 in order to allow for time to build satellites and to remedy any potential supply hiccups and/or production accidents. Let's say at least 3 months before the FCC deadline.

According to the CEO, this year, the Amaz...ing customer will consume over 2,000 reaction wheels from Rocket Lab, which translates into 500 satellites. **Amazon will need further 4,472 12Nms reaction wheels between Jan 2025 and April 2026**, which means that this further delivery should take place in space of 16 months. That is an average of 279.5 reaction wheels per month, or 838.5 reaction wheels per Q. **That would amount to quarterly revenues between $67 and $80.5 million (between $268 and $322 million per year), depending on the type of 12Nms reaction wheels, just from reaction wheels sold to Amazon.** Compare this to $60 million in revenues from all space systems customers in Q1 2024, which might include no revenue recognition from the Amazon deal.

The CFO stated that over $426 million of the current $1 billion backlog will be recognized in next 12 months. If 12Nms reaction wheels for Amazon were in the contract then subtracting $268 or $322 million for reaction wheels from the $426 million which will be recognized in next 12 months would leave only $158 or $104 million to be recognized from all other space systems revenue streams and launches. That would mean that Rocket Lab would do only 19 launches in next 12 months (till the end of May 2025) and that Rocket Lab would recognize zero revenues from any other space systems customer beside Amazon, which is nonsense. **12Nms reaction wheels are thus missing from the backlog.** **However, the deal exists as the CEO confirmed it. There is no other megaconstellation builder beside SpaceX and Amazon who would consume over 2,000 12Nms reaction wheels this year and while SpaceX is building their own reaction wheels, Amazon lacks such capability.**

**Let's go back to 2024. Over 2,000 12Nms reaction wheels in 2024 may translate into revenues of $160 million or $192 million, that is $40 million or $48 million per quarter if they would be recognized over the all quarters of 2024.**

These revenues do not seem to be recognized in Q1 2024 as space systems revenues increased by $8.5 million from $51.5 million (Q4 2023) to $60 million (Q1 2024).

Recognizing them over the remaining 3 quarters in 2024 would amount to a jump in revenues by $53 million or $64 million. There is a jump the the Q2 2024 guidance but not on such magnitude that it could be wholly attributed to a supply of 666 12Nms reaction wheels (1/3 of 2,000 to be consumed by Amazon this year).

This leaves us with a big potential jump in the Q3 2024 guidance.

\* 9,708, ie. 3 reaction wheels per satellite instead of 4 reaction wheels, would be contrary to redundancy and a risk taking that Amazon is not known for.

Let's also recall that the interview with the CEO and the CFO by DaveG discusses this contract, too:

""*We can't really talk too much about that but I, you know, would say that, correct me if I'm wrong but we're on track for like 2000 wheels this year or something like that (...) we can apply that scale manufacturing to those other smaller volume orders and get the cost reductions that go on with. It should be a material margin enhancer to all the rest of the business as well. It's not just, you know, helpful that we're getting, that we have this megaconstellation customer (...) Is the revenue being recognized from that deal like this year? Yes.*""

*Still, it gets them to Neutron*¬†... The company estimates it will spend roughly $250 million to build the medium-lift Neutron rocket. Rocket Lab says it continues to make progress in development, and a company spokesperson reiterated that timeline to the publication, saying, ""We‚Äôre still targeting to get Neutron on the pad before the end of the year."" That is all well and good, but it's perhaps worth remembering that SpaceX had its Falcon 9 rocket ""on the pad"" in January 2009 and did not launch for the first time until June 2010. So, if we're lucky, we might see Neutron fly in 2025.",81,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1amrmg8/were_still_targeting_to_get_neutron_on_the_pad/,0.9031,0.081,0.911,0.008
RKLB_posts.csv,RKLB Share Price vs. Short Interest - Latest Update,"NASDAQ released the latest short interest in RKLB just a short while ago (dated 11/29/2024 when the SP was at the ATH of >$27).¬† Below is a graph showing plots of RKLB short interest (obtained from NASDAQ) overlaid with the corresponding day's share price (obtained from Fidelity) covering the previous 1 year and 15 days. The earnings call was the main driving force for the share price rocketing up.¬† Shorts were caught napping and they desperately had to scramble to cover their positions which probably drove the share price up even more to the new ATH of >$27. As a result, short interest decreased dramatically (\~20%) from the previous month. Short interest was still high at \~49.28 million shares short or \~13% of the float as of 11/29/2024. I think new shorts have since then opened new short positions (this is how shorts typically react after a massive price spike) and they‚Äôre heavily shorting the stock which is partially causing the downtrend in the share price.¬† The other reason for the downtrend in the share price is probably due to profit taking.¬† My thinking is that we will see share price consolidation in the $20 - 22 range at least in the near term.  What do y‚Äôall think?¬† Please share here.

RKLB_posts.csv,To the Ones Sleeping on RKLB,"A few months ago I stumbled upon RKLB and it was hella low‚Ä¶ but I never pulled the trigger. As of late it‚Äôs been moving and so naturally i‚Äôve been looking into it more and more and wanted to get a feel for how it stacks up against the competition (This is just for people who are relatively new‚Ä¶ very obvious info). Rocket Lab is up against companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and some smaller guys like Astra and Firefly Aerospace.
 
Obviously Musk is the big dawg of the commercial space sector, with a $210 billion valuation. They dominate the industry with cheap rideshare missions for small satellites, which is bad news for Rocket Lab since they‚Äôre targeting the same market. Pretty much‚Ä¶. SpaceX‚Äôs scale and success are the biggest threats to Rocket Lab, hands down‚Ä¶. especially with the funding they just pulled too.

Blue Origin, while worth around $12 billion because they have Bezos running the show, the company is absolute dogwater for now and 0 threat. They are yet to surpass a suborbital launch lmao.

Now, Astra and Firefly are smaller but focused on launching small satellites at low costs. They‚Äôre not doing as many launches as Rocket Lab, but they could be disruptive by offering cheaper alternatives in the future but for now it's nothing crazy.

One company in this whole commercial space industry that kinda made me pause was Virgins Orbit. To really understand Rocket Lab‚Äôs position, I started looking into Virgin Orbit‚Äôs story. Basically for some background, they were another promising company in the small satellite market, valued at around $200 million before going bankrupt in 2023. This got me thinking though‚Ä¶ was Virgin Orbit ever worth more? Turns out, at its peak, Virgin Orbit was valued at around $3.7 billion because of the hype around their air-launch system.

That‚Äôs when I started to feel a little nervous. If Virgin Orbit, a company once worth billions, could go bankrupt, what about Rocket Lab? With a current valuation of $5.5 billion, it‚Äôs not that far off. Given how tough the space industry is (super high costs, tons of competition, substantial loss when things go bad, etc), it‚Äôs a fair question to ask if Rocket Lab could face a similar fate.

After digging deeper (GPT search is goated for this), I found some key reasons Rocket Lab is way more robust and unlikely to follow in Virgin Orbit‚Äôs footsteps:

* Unlike Virgin Orbit, which struggled with consistent operations and reliability, Rocket Lab has a proven record of successful launches. As of now, Rocket Lab has completed dozens of successful Electron launches, building customer confidence and expanding its market share. Looking at Virgin Orbit‚Ä¶. Basically they had only completed a handful of launches and faced way more technical issues. Rocket Lab's reliability in delivering payloads on time and at a competitive cost is a significant advantage over the difficulties Virgin Orbit experienced.  
* Rocket Lab is not solely dependent on launch services. It has successfully diversified into spacecraft design, satellite components, and satellite management services, which provide additional revenue streams. This strategic diversification helps mitigate the risks associated with relying solely on launch operations, which was one of Virgin Orbit‚Äôs weaknesses. Virgin Orbit primarily focused on air launch technology.  
* Rocket Lab has future projects like the development of the Neutron rocket, which will allow it to compete in the medium-lift launch market, giving it access to larger payloads and way more lucrative contracts. At this point‚Ä¶ Virgin Orbit was still trying to establish itself in the smaller payload market when it encountered financial troubles (so they weren't even able to get past logistics). . Additionally, Rocket Lab has been working on reusability with Electron, which could further reduce costs and increase profitability over time, a significant factor that Virgin Orbit lacked.  
* Rocket Lab has raised significant capital and managed its finances well, with plans to grow its business strategically. Virgin Orbit, despite its initial $3.7 billion valuation, faced liquidity issues and struggled to raise funds, eventually leading to bankruptcy. Rocket Lab‚Äôs revenue has been growing steadily, and while it is not yet profitable, the company's long-term plans for increasing revenue through more launches, satellite services, and new rocket developments give it a clearer path to profitability than Virgin Orbit ever had.  
* The demand for small and medium satellite launches is growing due to the rise of satellite constellations for communications, earth observation, and defence. Rocket Lab is well positioned to capitalise on this, having established itself as a trusted provider. Virgin Orbit‚Äôs limited ability to scale and capture a significant portion of this growing market played a role in its downfall.

So yeah, while I had some initial concerns comparing Rocket Lab to Virgin Orbit‚Äôs downfall, it‚Äôs clear that Rocket Lab is in a much stronger spot

RKLB_posts.csv,What many people miss about Rocket Lab,"I have seen a lot of posts on here and WSB that only discuss the launch side of Rocket Lab.

Rocket Lab is not just a launch company. They are way more than that. They are an end to end space company.

Take a look at these scenarios below.

Company X( basically all companies that need something in space to operate. Use ASTS for example): These companies design and build something that operates in space, but rely on another company to get their equipment there.

SpaceX: launch provider with an emphasis on launching their own constellation with further goals in space. We all know they can launch themselves.

Rocket Lab: started as a launch only company with Electron but have heavily diversified their business into space systems. Their business offers the ability to design, build, launch and operate a customers satellites or space craft or maybe their own constellation someday. This is why it is called end to end. Their business is not launch, launch is only one of their tools to more effectively do business in space. Neutron will not make or break this company. They do not rely in its success to make them profitable. They could stop development today and still be profitable in the future due to the way they have positioned themselves in the industry through their space system business segments. This type of position is going to be huge in the future as more people move their business into space.

I have followed this company for 3 years and they continue to impress me. Though launch is a very exciting part of this business, since it is really the only one we can see, I encourage every investor here to start viewing this company as an all around space company instead of just a launch company.

RKLB_posts.csv,Is there a bear case?," While investing money (and probably generally in life) I think it's important to understand the other side's argument better than your opponent.   


So while recently on this sub we are seeing a lot of optimism, and even hype i'll try to write a few words about how it can go wrong. At least what I think can go wrong.   


**Neutron engine and timeline delays.** 

RKLB announced Neutron will be operational in 2024, just six quarters away. 

On investor day in september 2022 Peter Beck announced there will be a significant change to Neutron design, instead of relatively simple (by rocket science standards) gas generator engine Archimedes will be oxygen rich staged combustion - a much more complicated concept. And there will be 9 of them (not 7) on every rocket. 

Here you can watch Scott Manley commenting on the change:

https://youtu.be/4Ky3YzhRWko?t=414  


Complexity of engine design will be on par with BE-4 and Raptor. And those two took like a decade to build, and did not reach orbit yet. Here we have less than two years. Difficult if not impossible. 

**Money and cash flows**

If we assume Neutron development delays happen we have to look at the cash burn and possibility of future equity rise and dilution. 

Last few quarters look fine (september 22 was when Neutrone design change was announced so lets start Q3 2022): 

&#x200B;

|quarter|cash|burn rate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Q3 22|515||
|Q4 22|484,3|\-30,7|
|Q1 23| 450|\-34,3|

a steady spend of 30+M per quarter doesn't seem like a lot, and gives us lots of runway to profitability. While Q2 23 is not going to tell us much (virgin complex acquisition, and possible helicopter sale will distort the numbers) I think costs associated with building Neutron will be increasing quickly. We have a growing headcount and major work to be done before us, is very difficult to estimate what capex is necessary, but 500M for an innovative reusable rocket is not a lot. A year delay with 60M burn per quarter and we're out of funds.

Just look at what it took to build a simpler Falcon 9. (by the way this may be the best clip in aerospace history): 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvim4rsNHkQ  


**Summary:**

If things get delayed we may see dilution which may hurt the stock price temporarily, but overall even if 50-70M shares will be issued and sold at around 5$ impact should not be huge. 

If the company successfully delivers Neutron (and with Peter Beck at helm I see no reason why it would not) investment in Rocket lab can bring significant returns in a 5-7 years time frame. 

I just can't imagine successful space company with reuseble rockets and advance space systems being valued below 10B$

Also with the current geopolitical situation and China catching up in space development I don't believe the US government would ever let RKLB fail.

I didn't write anything on Electron and space systems, because I don't see any significant risks there. Mayby I'm wrong? 

Disc:

im long Rocketlab

i usually invest in cash flow positive companies that return cash to shareholders, RKLB is an exception. (I'm passionate about space and astronomy, follow the industry for  allmost¬† a decade and think they will succeed)

So what risks do you see? What can go wrong that we are missing? ",73,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/14ojut3/is_there_a_bear_case/,0.7879,0.099,0.814,0.087

RKLB_posts.csv,Peter Beck and Rocket Lab have an opportunity‚Ä¶and seem to be playing it right.,"This isn‚Äôt to get too political‚Ä¶it‚Äôs about business but also how politics plays an important role in the success of space focused companies.  Everyone here knows that Space X is the current leader in the industry.  They have a solid infrastructure, some good engineers, and have done a great job so far.  They got an early lead and were well on their way to being the leader for decades to come.  Something similar could be said for Tesla.  However, in the early stages in a new industry, big mistakes can be extremely costly.  In the case of Tesla, the focus on the cybertruck and electric semi‚Äôs has cost a fair amount of Cap ex and no revenue.  Cybertrucks are sitting on lots and in fields and if you follow the Reddit r/cyberstuck you can see that they are basically hot garbage.  Teslas were incredibly successful at first but the constant price decreases and increases have turned some people off from buying again.  On top of that, and more importantly, Musk himself has alienated his largest consumer base with his anti-California, anti-lgbtq, etc‚Ä¶nonsense.  If there is one thing most successful CEOs will say is keep your loyal customers happy.  Tesla‚Äôs share of EV sales has dropped from 75% in 2022 to just under 50% in 2024.  

But, this is about Rocket Lab.  Space companies are going to continue to rely on government contracts along with the private sector.  For U.S. contracts, the company has to be based in the U.S. and meet specific security requirements.  There are only a couple of companies that can do that.  Over the next decade, the space industry should see phenomenal growth.  One company will not provide all the services.  The contracts will be split between multiple companies.  When it comes time to award those contracts, ability and consistency will play a huge role and also reputation.  Beck has done a fantastic job of being politically neutral.  He just gets the job done.  Musk on the other hand has decided to back one horse whole-heartedly and there will be a price to pay for that.  If his candidate loses, along with the trepidation congress already feels about how much power and influence he already has, it could be an opportunity for Rocket Lab to grow with huge contracts.  They just have to get Neutron to be successful.  If Kuniper turns out to have better technology then Starlink and if ASTS technology takes market share since a lot of people just want their phone to work in remote areas and not carry around an entire dish, then that could slow Starlink growth.  Space X will continue to be successful due to Starship but they are not guaranteed the top spot forever now.

RKLB_posts.csv,Let's talk MSR and competing proposals...,"MSR. So hot right now. For better or worse, I wanted to share my opinions on the likelihood RKLB gets the MSR mission.

I realize we only have the abstracts for the proposals, but it should be enough to tell us who is taking this seriously. I'm honestly flabbergasted at some of the proposals, and I've attempted to summarize the abstracts even further below. You'll quickly see that it's a two, MAYBE three horse race... and RKLB is in it.

* Rocket Lab: ""We put a lot of effort into this proposal, and intend to show you just why we are the perfect choice. We can and have done nearly everything you're asking a company to do, we have a proven track record and a reliable path to mission success, and we can do it faster and cheaper than anyone else.""

* Lockheed Martin: ""Sure, we can do it for your max budget and.... sometime... before 2040. We have lots of experience with this stuff, dude. We've partnered with you before and we sure liked all the cash you filled our coffers with. Give us the contract and we will do the bare minimum to meet any of your needs. But we're pals, man! Like, our relationship goes WAY back... and don't forget the lobbying money we spend! So... can we have the money now? kthx""

* Blue Origin: ""So you're already building SLS and HLS, so...let's like... leverage those options, and then you won't even need to worry about how many samples you can return! *SLAPS 4 BILLION DOLLAR ROCKET* This baby can fit SO MANY mars samples inside of it!! We can't talk about schedule because uh.... that's kind of on you (wink wink) but uh.... we think by using these options you might be able to accelerate your schedule? But listen to THIS... we've got a couple of super brainy Ph.D.'s leading a ""team"" of EXPERTS looking into all of this, and they have a whole 50 years of combined experience on mars missions! So uh.... pick us, and then we might actually take any of this seriously.""

* Quantum Space: ""We develop spacecraft. Or.... I guess... we're trying to. We haven't had any success at all, but we're smart cookies who think outside the box!! We think we came up with a novel but quite difficult approach to trajectory and spacecraft needs by basically doing a lunar orbit rendezvous and hand off of the samples to another vessel before returning to Earth. Sure, we know you're probably going to call this bullshit, be we prefer to call it a ""disruptive concept"""".

* Aerojet Rocketdyne: ""We're smart cookies and we take this seriously. We've already identified areas where we can reduce the mass of the theoretical MAV and SRL, and that would allow us to use existing technologies to get the lander on the surface. We've been doing this a long time and have a lot of success, and we've already started to figure out which propulsion technologies would fit into a mission like this or which would need to develop further. We really want to use the skycrane to land the MAV, and will likely concentrate all efforts on that front since it would speed things up considerably. The reduced mass MAV and SRL will allow us to return plenty of samples.""

* Northrop Grumman: ""So we are like, quite competent in propulsion, and we've been doing this stuff for like, a really long time. We will do some uh.... engineering.... and uh, we want some government money so we can keep developing our solid rocket motors. And then you can use them for this mission!! :D""

* SpaceX: ""Uhh... we're already going to mars. We don't know when, but.... we can just pick up your samples for you while we're there, and then charge you a shit ton of money for the privilege :) Sit back and relax!""

* Whittinghill Aerospace: ""We're a cutting-edge tech firm out of the Midwest, awaiting imminent patent approval on the next generation of ~~radar detectors (D2D)~~ MON hybrid rocket motors that have both huge military and civilian applications. Now, right now John, our stock trades over the counter at $0.10.... but we..... oh shit.... wrong number.""


So, alright then. We have some serious proposals, and we have some jokers. I think there are a few that you can remove straight off the bat. Whittinghill and Quantum Space. One is an engineering company, and the other makes spacecraft. Lots of companys do both, these companies do just the one, and are both quite small and not in a position to handle such an important contract. That widles us down from 8 to 6.

This is where it gets a little tricky, since we don't know what's actually in the proposals... all we have are the abstracts. But taking things at face value, there are a few additional proposals that don't really seem to be taking it seriously, or don't really offer any value to NASA by choosing them. Those options are Lockheed, BO, and Northrop. Yes, THOSE BIG THREE. Why? Lockheed is basically ""max budget, max timeline"". What incentive does that provide? BO relies on SLS sticking around AND on HLS sticking around.... which kinda feels like a complication of.... the SpaceX option? And Northrop can just pound sand. Their abstract is one of the worst in the whole bunch outside of Whittinghil and Quantum IMO. 

So... that leaves THREE actual ""competitors"" IMO. Let's dig into those. Rocket Lab, SpaceX, and Aerojet Rocketdyne, so let's start with Rocketdyne. They've put in the effort here, and have the company heritage to execute on their claims. They want to leverage existing technologies, while developing their rocket motors further so they can reduce the weight of the MAV. Smart cookies here, but no real promise on a timeline. Just vague talks of being able to 'accelerate' the timeline if they CAN leverage the skycrane the way they want. Solid choice, reasonable value to NASA. I give this option a B+.

Now let's talk about SpaceX. It's not so much a 'proposal' for a 'mission' as it is like, ""Hey Jim, I'm running to the store anyways. Want me to bring you back anything? Oh...no... I'm not going now. I'm going in like... 5-9 years... or something?"". It's not a BAD proposal, but without knowing the financials it's hard to say how likely NASA would be to choose this option. They're relying on HLS anyways, so if Starship is gonna be a thing, this could make sense. But they lose a lot of control, and who knows if their proposal is for a $9B budget and a return date in 2038? They don't say, and I don't think NASA will like losing that much control and influence on the mission. I give this option a C-. Feasible, but probably not NASA's best actual choice, since it really strips them of their autonomy.

And finally.... Rocket Lab. They can do it for under $2B on a fixed-price contract WAY earlier than NASA's requirement of 2040. They've built spacecraft, sent spacecraft to the moon using multiple trajectory burns, they've engineered and built spacecraft busses, reaction wheels, solar panels, navigation and guidance systems, rocket engines and rockets themselves, and they've even returned a capsule to earth that had samples inside of it already. They can do the entire mission, end-to-end, for 18.1% of NASA's budget, and get the samples here almost a DECADE earlier than required. Even IF NASA choose RKLB and they didn't deliver as promised, NASA would have SO much damn cash left to pursue other avenues (and presumably, almost a decade to do it...) that it would seem almost criminal for them not to select the RKLB proposal. RKLB could fail and they'd still be likely to succeed ""Hey Elon... grab us some samples on your next 2038 Mars mission... here's $5B"". Cool. NASA still got the samples back before 2040 and for $7B. I give this proposal an A-. The only thing keeping me from an A or an A+ is that Neutron isn't flying yet.

So, those are my big three that have a chance, but I personally think it boils down to Rocket Lab and Aerojet Rocketdyne. SpaceX is going to mars anyways, and like I mentioned above, we could just pivot to having them bring us back some samples a decade from now if things don't otherwise work out. For that reason, I give the SpaceX proposal a 15% chance of being selected, the Rocketdyne proposal a 40% chance of being selected, and RKLB a 45% chance of being selected. I'm assuming all the proposals I 'eliminated' earlier have a 0% chance, but that's likely not true. However, I wanted to simplify this.

So, from my seat, RKLB is actually the MOST likely proposal to be selected for MSR? Why? Execution, cost, and timeline PLUS the ability to NASA to pivot to SpaceX in the 2030's if necessary. Rocketdyne a close second.

RKLB_posts.csv,First time RKLB has ever reported a net increase in Current Assets,"I'm sure a good amount of you caught this, but in all the excitement around record revenue/growth, the successful hot fire, the neutron infrastructure updates, etc, I missed something.

As far as I'm aware Rocket lab has never posted a quarterly net increase in total current assets **(obviously not counting the capital raise in February).**

Except they did last quarter. This really surprised me, I expected to see a similar quarter over quarter decrease typical to any quarter since the SPAC merger.

Total current assets as well as cash & equivalents + marketable securities combined are slightly higher this quarter than last.

Is this the start of a trend? I'm skeptical for now. CFO Adam Spice mentioned an increase in capex through the next 3-4 quarters tapering off in Q2 '25 as the first neutron launch approaches. That mixed with the lower expected launch revenue in Q3, I wouldn't be too surprised to see the downtrend resume, at least in the near term.

I still found this encouraging and thought it was worth a share.

I have done some analysis on potential acquisition targets, let me know if that's something you'd like to see, happy to share.

RKLB_posts.csv,What Are Wall Street Analysts Missing in Rocket Lab's Growth Story? Mapping the Rocket Lab's global empire,"The BofA analyst was talking about the defense industry in the recent Yahoo Finance interview. When he was asked about Rocket Lab, the first and only thing that he discussed was the Neutron rocket. This further supports the point made in [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cvqs8a/what_are_wall_street_analysts_missing_in_rocket/) that analysts are overfocusing on Neutron and they're missing more than the 3/4 of the Rocket Lab's growth, which is in its space systems business. When someone asks me about Rocket Lab, I say that yeah, they got rockets, but the role of their rockets is to support their main business by enabling them to develop and test their components and software for spacecrafts in space on customers' money. Heritage of products is very important in space business.

To comprehend the scale of Rocket Lab's main business, it's necessary to know a thing about **Rocket Lab's facilities producing space systems products which amount to 78% of the current Rocket Lab's backlog, potentially as high as 90% as some future revenues have been kept away from the backlog, and also for 73% of the Q2 2024 revenue guidance.** Here's the list of all Rocket Lab's facilities:

1. Global HQ in Auckland, New Zealand
2. Rutherford assembly and test facility in Maramarua, New Zealand
3. Electron launch facility at Mahia, New Zealand
4. Ex-SailGP facility in Warkworth, New Zealand
5. Ex-Sinclair Interplanetary production facility in Toronto, Canada
6. Ex-SolAero Technologies facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA
7. Ex-Advanced Solutions, Inc. office in Littleton, Colorado, USA
8. Ex-Planetary Systems Corporation facility in Silver Spring, Maryland, USA
9. Ex-Lockheed Martin production facility in Middle River, Maryland, USA
10. Electron launch facility on Wallops Island, Virginia, USA
11. US HQ in Long Beach, California, USA
12. Ex-Virgin Orbit facility in Long Beach, California, USA
13. Rutherford engine test facilities in California, USA
14. Neutron production facility on Wallops Island, Virginia, USA
15. Neutron launch facility on Wallops Island, Virginia, USA
16. Archimedes test stand in Stennis Center, Mississippi, USA

In addition to mission control centers in Auckland and Long Beach, Rocket Lab has 2 further mission control centers. Rocket Lab also operates comm stations.

5 out of 16 (No. 5 to 9) are purely dedicated to the space systems segment, 3 (No. 14 to 16) are purely dedicated to Neutron, 3 (No. 4, 10 and 13) to Electron and the remaining 5 (No. 1, 2, 3, 11 and 12) facilities are a mix. Facilities below are those of which I am sure that they're supporting the booming space systems business.

**The Auckland HQ** is the global hub. It comprises the mission control, R&D and production facilities for both launch vehicles and spacecrafts including the high-volume reaction wheels production line.

**Long Beach** **HQ** facilities are the US hub. They have the mission control, R&D and production facilities for Photon sat bus and Rutherford and Archimedes engines, spacecraft components and spacecraft assembly.

**Sinclair** is the expanded R&D and production facility for spacecraft components such as star trackers, reaction wheels, laser crosslinks, electronics, etc.

**SolAero** is the R&D and production facility for solar cells, solar panels, electronics, etc..

**Advances Solutions** develops flight software and offers mission simulation, and Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) services.

**Planetary Systems Corporation** is the expanded R&D and production facility for separation systems and sat dispensers.

**Ex-Lockheed Martin's Middle River** facility produces advanced composite structures: ""*support the development and manufacture of carbon composite spacecraft buses, structural panels and assemblies, satellite dispensers, aerostructures and heat shields, composite overwrap pressure vessels, solar panel substrates, launch vehicle structures and more. The site will also play a role in the development and long-term supply of carbon composite structures for Rocket Lab‚Äôs new medium lift launch vehicle, Neutron.*""

Not listed is the **Johns Hopkins APL** which has been cooperating with Rocket Lab on commercializing ""*near and deep space capable small spacecraft telemetry and control radio technology*"".

These facilities have been further developing so my information may not up to date as they may have acquired additional functions.

To better appreciate the speed at which Rocket Lab moves and grows, let's go back to 2017:

* In 2017 Rocket Lab had some facilities in New Zealand - the HQ, Rutherford test and assembly facility and the launch facility. They also opened their first facility in Huntington Beach, California, USA.
* In 2018 Rocket Lab selected Wallops for Electron launches from the US soil.
* In 2020, Rocket Lab acquired Sinclair Interplanetary and moved their US facility from Huntington Beach to Long Beach.
* In 2021-23 they went on an acquisition spree: Advances Solutions Inc., Planetary Systems Corp., SolAero and SailGP have been all added during this time along with the most of their staff. They've also purchased the Ex-Virgin Orbit's rocket factory in Long Beach and the Ex-Lockheed Martin's facility in Middle River. They've also started building the high-volume production facility in the HQ. They have also started building Neutron production and launch facilities on Wallops Island. All of them have been successfully integrated into the Rocket Lab's global empire.
* In the meantime, Rocket Lab and the CEO have been supporting the grassroot space startups in New Zealand, which may be either acquired or they may cooperate with Rocket Lab down the line.

Further acquisitions are expected with cash raised in Feb 2024. One of my guesses is Novo Space (I give it a 10% chance).

The launch segment is an important enabler but it is not the main profit maker. It makes me wonder why are analysts so overfocused on Neutron or Electron/HASTE launches to the point that they're missing the Rocket Lab's main business.

Rockets, satellites, hardware, and software.

**How were they listed?**  
SPAC. They had a peak at $18.

**Who is the CEO?**  
Sir Peter Beck.

**Wait, the CEO is knighted?**  
Yes, he's a New Zealander.

**Wait, the CEO of a significant aerospace company is a New Zealander?**  
Yeah, that's why it's unusual. It shows his intelligence in achieving something no one expected.

**Who are their competitors?**  
SpaceX, Blue Origin, Firefly, Stoke, and technically Astra.

**Wait, I only know two of those.**  
Two have never launched, and two haven't launched for ages.

**Wait, didn't one of those companies also get listed and then delisted?**  
Astra did that, and Virgin Orbit too, until they filed for Chapter 11.

**Ok, cool. What are Rocket Lab's competitive advantages over SpaceX and Blue Origin?**  
With Electron, smaller satellites that need to be launched sooner and to closer locations can be cheaper and more profitable over time compared to delays.

**Wait, why does their revenue recognition change so often over quarters?**  
Revenue for launches can only be recognized at launch, with 90% paid by launch day.

**How many launches are needed on Electron per year to be profitable?**  
Around 21.

**Wait, they didn‚Äôt launch that many per year.**  
First, consider revenue recognition. Delays are primarily on the client side.

**What is Neutron?**  
A significant new rocket that can lift up to 13 metric tons.

**How much does R&D for this cost?**  
It's supposed to be around $300 million. It might cost more.

**Wait, that‚Äôs a lot.**  
Yes, but relatively speaking, it's cheap. The Falcon 9 cost around $390 million in 2011.

**When will it launch?**  
Mid next year.

**How far along are they in development?**  
They've tested the engine.

**What about their other business activities?**  
Are they doing recovery?  
Soon.

**I‚Äôm glad you asked about satellites and space systems. These are high-revenue lines, profiting under SolAero and Sinclair, and selling carbon composites.**

**What do those do?**  
Star trackers, ion propulsion, solar panels, separation systems, and solar panels.

**How did they acquire these companies?**  
M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions).

**Wait, that‚Äôs like shopping for companies?**  
Yes, it's hinted that they may buy something for a new constellation.

**Who are their customers?**  
NASA, DOD, Space Force, and commercial customers.

**Wait, the financial statements say they‚Äôve got convertible notes.**  
Yes, they have debt that can become shares.

**Great, are there any cons?**  
Yes.

**What are they?**  
Risk of a launch failure, delays in Neutron, and onerous legislation.

**Ok, what‚Äôs the ticker?**  
RKLB.

**Is there anything else?**  
Yes, I recommend reading *When the Heavens Went on Sale* and watching *Wild Wild Space*, which discusses Rocket Lab, Astra, Planet Labs, and Firefly.",71,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1ewizrn/faq_for_rklb_for_new_wsb_people_fixed_thanks/,0.9928,0.134,0.835,0.032

RKLB_posts.csv,Exciting growth prospects in Australia,"I‚Äôm a space enthusiast from down under (NZ) who has been following Rocket Lab for a while. I want to discuss the new subsidiary company Rocket Lab Australia, which has not been mentioned often on this sub.

I think there are prospects for significant growth in the Australian space and hypersonic defence industry in the coming years. All in all, Rocket Lab is poised to become the launch capability leader in the Oceanic region by 2030.

The Australian Government is committed to pour funding into space and defence in the coming years. This could feasibly supply bread and butter contracts to keep Rocket Lab‚Äôs bottom line steady (and help fund Neutron).

The only other launch provider in Australia is Gilmour Space, a promising small company, have only launched small rockets. They are still well behind on Rocket Lab in proving launch capabilities, and are not going for vertical integration of space systems. The maiden flight of their first commercial orbital launch vehicle, called¬†**Eris**, is planned for late 2024. This is planned to deliver a similar payload to Electron.

There are not many launch sites in Australia yet. It‚Äôs possible Rocket Lab would provide launches from New Zealand for Australian contracts or build their own launch facility there.

Here are some of the facts:

* Rocket Lab recently established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Rocket Lab Australia, with the purpose of exploring opportunities to support Australia's national space capabilities.
* HASTE, a suborbital launch vehicle derived from Rocket Lab's Electron rocket, was also recently announced. HASTE aims to advance hypersonic and suborbital system technology development through reliable, high-cadence flight test opportunities.

**Space sector and launch growth**

* The Australian Government has set a goal to triple the size of the Australian space sector from AUD$4 billion in 2016 to AUD$12 billion and create 20,000 additional jobs by 2030. They have already committed more than AUD$2 billion to the civil space sector since 2018, supporting various programs related to Earth Observation, satellite infrastructure, and high-tech manufacturing. (""the most significant investment ever made in Australia‚Äôs civil space sector."")
* The 2022-23 Budget includes funding of AUD$1.16 billion until 2038-39 and AUD$38.5 million per annum ongoing for the first phase of a National Space Mission for Earth Observation. This investment aims to make Australia more self-sufficient in critical Earth Observation data while fostering capability and job opportunities in the industry.
* Rocket Lab Australia has a head start over its competition in the region, most notably the fledgling launch provider Gilmour Space.

**Defense**

* The recent AUKUS security alliance between the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia is dedicated to developing hypersonic missiles. It‚Äôs possible these Governments will co-fund tests.
* The Australian Government‚Äôs defence public strategy targets acquiring approximately USD 190 billion in new defence systems by 2030.
* Of this, AUD$17 billion (USD$18.3) is allocated to the development of Defence space capabilities, to enhance existing space capabilities and develop new solutions domestically and internationally.

One downside to note is the Australian Government is funding a satellite manufacturing hub for larger earth observation satellites via a collaboration of companies. This is still in the early stages of being established. It‚Äôs possible there would not be much upside for Rocket Lab‚Äôs space systems division if the hub is successful. However, a collaborative hub possibly provides fewer opportunities for bespoke designs than a vertically integrated company.

Considering these facts, Rocket Lab seems in a favorable position to expand its presence in Australia.

Interested in others thoughts!

 ‚ÄúWhen  you think of Moon missions you think of the enormous Saturn V rockets  of the 1960s and billions of dollars, but we‚Äôre going to the same  destination with a carbon fibre rocket and our Photon spacecraft the  size of a bar fridge, all for just a fraction of that cost,‚Äù Beck says. 

 ‚ÄúAs  technology continues to shrink and with each advance in aerospace  engineering, we can achieve so much with un-crewed missions like  Capstone. That saves time and money, making exploration much more  accessible.‚Äù

RKLB_posts.csv,Confidential Customers?  Expect more of them and why I‚Äôm accumulating shares.,"First of all I screwed up buy reducing my shares after it gained 200%.  I was buying at $3.5 - $6 and after a healthy increase I sold some around $10.  I still have a good amount and I‚Äôm accumulating again and here is why‚Ä¶

This latest launch was by a ‚Äúconfidential customer‚Äù and the new contracts for neutron are also from a ‚Äúconfidential customer.‚Äù  I knew they would beat earnings since the new customer wasn‚Äôt factored into the earnings forecast during the Q3 presentation so I bought a bunch more and calls just before earnings.  Be prepared to see ‚Äúconfidential customer‚Äù a lot from Rocket Lab in the future.  A lot of developed countries, especially in Europe, do not see Trump as an ally and now that Leon is part of the government they want to distance themselves from him and SpaceX.  If Trump installs large tariffs then you can easily predict a trade war.  The faster these other countries get up their own internet satellite systems the better.  Not only do they not want to rely on Starlink for secure communications, they don‚Äôt want to rely on SpaceX to put up their satellites.  This is where Rocket Lab will be taking full advantage of having non-U.S. based launch facilities.  For those that have been here awhile there were rumors of Rocket Lab acquiring a constellation builder in the U.K.  I fully expect that to happen now to service their European and Asian customers and be fully integrated from build to launch.   I bet we get news of that before the 4th Quarter earnings in February.  Several people that are very Pro SpaceX / Leon  won‚Äôt read this far and you will see responses from them below calling this bullshit and how SpaceX is far and away the only real private company option for other countries‚Ä¶.just watch.

My prediction is RKLB between $35 - $50 by the end of 2025 unless there is a black swan event.

When starship makes it to Mars and the world realizes there's unlimited wealth in the asteroid belt.... Every government will create / shift funds to space. Book it. This is one we will all look back at and wished we had purchased more... 

Exciting times.... I'm more excited for my kids. Our smart phones will be VHS for them. Space travel to the moon and modular space stations will become a normal thing / air bnb's/ cruises in space. The TAM can't even be imagined. Yes, that might be after our time, but it will be our generation and companies like RKLB that will provide the infrastructure to make that happen. 

I've never been more excited as an investor, but more so as a human being. It's taken thousands of years to get here and we get to be a part of it.

&#x200B;

I was an active observer of the market since I was investing in SPCE. Now I am holding 5060 shares in RKLB and lost much money in call options. My opinion is still only subjective view of the cold-bloded psychopath - so take it to the account haha

&#x200B;

Many of you are saying that:

\- the stock is going to crash

\- Beck is not gonna sell or will sell a lot

\- we are dead because of the insiders selling

&#x200B;

1. The stock performance in comparison to the others is doing very very good. We are still around 10 $ when the others are in 2-6 USD... (I mean space SPAC's) The current price is established by the negative sentiment not the bad fundamentals which are not the same, are better in objective way. Is that stock overvalued? In some sense yes in some no - yes because using normal analysis profit/price it is totally overvalued, but if we look at potential growth it is totally undervalued - Look at professional analysis, the cut was done from 20->15 during the market hammering, still 50% to go up.
2. You are all wrong, because for sure insiders will sell - this is TOTALLY NORMAL and it would be very very strange that Beck and others will keep their 100% stake without selling antyhing. FYI Beck is not an stock investor who is thinking that this is gonna moon in 3 years so I will be holding ALL the stock for the 3 yers... c'mon would you hold all of your stake in his position? And honestly this is completely normal.
3. Insiders selling is present for ALL the stock companies so whats the point? Is it changing fundamentals? Nothing at all... So hold your horses guys.

&#x200B;

If you are in dept, having financial problems or just mental problems seeing stock value decline - than stock market is not for you. If you look at this as fundaental investment with great revenue perspectives and a real bumpy ride - than you can buy now more shares :) Take care for all of you guys!",62,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/s9bgi6/stop_tellin_bull_to_others/,0.9064,0.108,0.813,0.079

RKLB_posts.csv,Valuation ,"I keep seeing comments that RKLB is cheap and SpaceX is overvalued. Or other commentary that sounds like it is based on faith and not thought out metrics. Full disclosure I'm bullish on both. 

Morgan Stanley has probably one of the most publicly available in-depth analysis of SpaceX value. They note that 60% of the value is in Starlink. That would make SpaceX rocket side about a $75B valuation. Given their launch revenue was estimated to be $5.5B for 2024 that is a revenue multiplier of 13.6x. Apply that to Rocket lab and you get a valuation of $10b on $245m of revenue and you have a revenue multiplier of 40.8x. 

RocketLab's launch business is three times more expensive to buy than SpaceX's right now. Not sure SpaceX is overvalued (on launch).  Starship is arguably a much bigger leap than Neutron (new model vs providing a launch alternative to existing model). So, not sure how SpaceX can be called overvalued and at the same time saying RocketLab has room for another 150% gain ($50 share).

If this is correct (and it was quick and sort price analysis), does RKLB benefit from IPO access and demand for the sector that cannot be easily accessed via SpaceX? Is there something else driving the multiplier difference? Yes both companies do more than launch, but one has turned that into revenue while the other is just starting down that path. And that portion of the valuation is pulled out of SpaceX in the above analysis and assumed to be $0 for RKLB. 

Maybe that's the difference. That the market is already valuing the non-launch business at even more astronomical multipliers than SpaceX's non-launch business.",59,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1gs6fmx/valuation/,0.8615,0.063,0.912,0.025
RKLB_posts.csv,Anyone here holding LUNR and RDW aswell as RKLB?,"I‚Äôve finally pulled the trigger and put some money in the space stocks, and I‚Äôve gone for RKLB, LUNR and RDW, with RKLB being the biggest holding of the 3.

My train of thought was, the more these companies grow and develop, get more cash behind them, capture more share of the growing space market etc, that these 3 combined will be absolutely raking the contracts in. RKLB for launch and end to end space services, Redwire for development and construction of higher end speciality space tech (their space 3d printing will be a huge bread winner imo, and then all their general high quality infrastructure like their solar cells, robotic arms, cameras, sensors, RF transmitters, in space manufacturing, their space greenhouses etc), and LUNR could/will be the go to company for getting your things on to the moon surface which is essential and they‚Äôre one of the only ones offering actual payload delivery to the moon surface (can‚Äôt see many commercial avenues for this currently but now space is more accessible than ever, I predict that america will want to have some amount of control over the moon surface, before China gets there first, I‚Äôd imagine establishing moon dominance will become a bit of a strategic/geopolitical thing)

Obviously this is all wildly speculative and a very, very high risk play. But in the long run (im thinking 15 years +), if these 3 are still around by that point, they‚Äôll be space giants and there‚Äôll always be one of the three receiving a contract for something. Obviously spacex will be hoovering up contracts too, but I still think that in the long term, these 3 will be consistentently winning more and more contracts and are probably positioned to be giants in the market when it inevitably consolidates.

RKLB_posts.csv,A revelation I‚Äôve come to realise,"One of the biggest unknowns we‚Äôve had about Neutrons commercial success, is how well it will actually compete with Falcon 9. I for example, have always been hopeful, but a bit unsure about the fact that Neutron can only put 13 Tons into LEO in reusable configuration, compared to a much higher offering from Falcon 9.

Until the penny dropped that Falcon 9 is a mature design that‚Äôs been in production and service for well over a decade, and has seen many iterations and evolutions over it‚Äôs life.

I searched it up, Falcon 9s first ever iteration ‚Äúv1.0‚Äù could only put 9 tonnes into LEO, and it wasn‚Äôt reusable. The second iteration ‚Äúv1.1‚Äù could put 13 tonnes into LEO, and wasn‚Äôt reusable. It wasn‚Äôt until v1.2 came about in 2015 that it could then put 18.5 tons into LEO in reusable configuration and 22.8 Tons into LEO as an expendable rocket. It then later got refined into its next iteration ‚ÄúBlock 5‚Äù, but it‚Äôs payload capacity stayed the same, and the en you‚Äôve got Falcon Heavy which obviously has the higher capacities again.

So when you compare this to Neutron, it‚Äôs starting out brilliantly already. Considering Neutron is a foetus and Falcon 9 is a fully matured vehicle by now, and even so, F9 in its current state can only put 5.5 more tons into orbit than Neutron can (with both in LEO reusable configuration respectively). 

It‚Äôs safe to assume that as Neutron and Archimedes go through the development process and receive updates/iterations as it goes through its life and matures, that Neutron will be a very strong contender to Falcon 9. I mean, we already know that Archimedes in it‚Äôs current stage of life, will be operated at pretty low stress levels. And even at low stress levels, it‚Äôs starting considerably further ahead than where Falcon 9 started its life. Over the years of neutron being in service, when Rocket Lab refine and improve on their base design of neutron, when they learn more about Archimedes and how far they can push it whilst still being reliable to launch again and again and again, it seems safe to assume that Neutrons payload capacity will see decent payload improvements.

But my main point to realise is that Neutron is starting its life, leaps and bounds ahead of where Falcon 9 started its life, in terms of payload capacity and the fact that it will be reusable right from the outset. Obviously, this isn‚Äôt all down to Peter Beck masterclass, it‚Äôs been over a decade since F9 came to life, and technology has moved on since then. Still though, with this in mind, I feel a lot more confident about the argument of ‚ÄúHow will Neutron compete with Falcon 9‚Äù. 

Will we see a neutron heavy? I doubt it but I‚Äôd love to be proven wrong in 5-10 years time. But with this in mind, not even taking into account that certain clients may pick rocket lab purely because it‚Äôs the only option that isn‚Äôt Elon Musk, AND the fact that Rocket Lab will offer end to end space services unlike SpaceX, AND the fact that Rocket Lab missions are tailored to their customers better and have a more precise orbit insertion, I think it‚Äôs pretty reasonable to assume that Neutron will at the very least, give Falcon 9 a good run for their money. 

The only thing that does still worry me slightly is that Falcon 9 has more than paid off for it‚Äôs self by now, so SpaceX will be able to price gouge/undercut Rocket Lab as much as they want (within reason), and Rocket Lab can only lower their prices so far to match it, after all, they have years of neutron service ahead of them to pay off the development costs.",59,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fttb0l/a_revelation_ive_come_to_realise/,0.9898,0.109,0.836,0.055
RKLB_posts.csv,Huge component of the business not yet factored into share price,"I wanted to point out something that others have mentioned before, particularly Vince is Bullish:

Peter Beck has said more than once that Rocket Lab is aiming to launch 50% of their rockets for customers and 50% of their rockets for themselves. This is because one of the primary purposes of their business is to create some sort of space infrastructure akin to SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink - some type of constellation that provides a service with high value for customers and high profit margins for Rocket Lab.

SpaceX‚Äôs valuation ballooned (almost doubled) to $200B since Starlink has come online.

When ASTS simply mentioned their constellation contract with AT&T, their market cap 10x‚Äôd in 3 months (before they had put anything into space).

Rocket Lab is fully vertically integrated (ASTS had to use a SpaceX rocket to get their first 5 satellites for AT&T into orbit). Once Rocket Lab is ready to begin building their own constellation, they‚Äôll be able to do it at significantly lower cost than ASTS.

The only reason Rocket Lab‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt moved on these repeated announcements of Peter Beck‚Äôs 50/50 plan for the company is that they haven‚Äôt announced exactly what their constellation will be yet.

But anyone that knows this company can pretty safely assume it‚Äôll be a success that drives huge profits.

Remember, ASTS moved 10x on news of a constellation. Rocket Lab has announced a constellation too but there‚Äôs been zero movement (recent movement is due to other reasons like Neutron progress and price upgrades).

Once they announce the purpose of their constellation and provide a roadmap with more details, the stock could easily 2-5x in a handful of months. This will almost certainly occur simultaneously with the first successful flight of neutron or shortly after (6-12 months).

Personally, my PT for the stock, which I plan to hold onto until at least 2028, is $150.

These price targets tell us nothing of the assumptions used to arrive at them, or the time frame over which the analyst is estimating. If your horizon is 12 months, then I suppose they might be useful.

The DCF Fair Value, or Intrinsic Value, is the gold standard for determining how much an investment is worth - based on a number of assumptions. It generates a fair value, but also states the assumptions used to arrive at that figure.

Using Simply Wall St's example as a starting point, I've created by own DCF for RKLB - with assumptions that personally I am comfortable with.

**My Discounted Cash Flow**

|Metric|Value|
|:-|:-|
|Risk-Free Rate|3.00%|
|Equity Risk Premium|4.47%|
|Industry Levered Beta|1.077 |
|Discount Rate|7.81%|
|Levered FCF 2031 ($M)|1,069|
|Total Present Value ($M)|13,148|
|Shares Outstanding (M)|449|
|Fair Value Share Price ($)|29.28|
|Current Share Price ($)|9.05|
|Margin of Safety|69%|

**My Assumptions**

I have assumed a 'Risk-Free Rate' of 3%, even though US Government Bonds are currently yielding about 1.9%. This is because I have an expectation that yields are going to rise to something like their pre-pandemic levels. I personally can't see them going higher than this because of the vast levels of government debt. I think in spite of inflation, the Fed are going to have to keep a lid on interest rates.

For the 'Equity Risk Premium', I have assumed the [forward price to earnings](https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_pe_ratio_forward_estimate) of the S&P, expressed as a yield (1/PE). Being brutally honest, I think the outlook for stocks is not great with valuations so high across the market - but I wanted to be cautious here.

I have deviated from Simply Wall St on the 'Industry Levered Beta'. I have used their same calculation, which takes into account RKLB's low Debt to Market Equity - but I'm not convinced by their underlying unlevered value for the Aerospace & Defense industry. I have used the value for the industry [here](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/Betas.html). But I am confident that Aerospace & Defense is the right benchmark.

Since yesterday, SWS have updated the free cash flow projections for RKLB. So I have used those new values. The values feel right to me, resulting in a 'Levered FCF 2031' of circa $1.1B. Looking at the total addressable market, the projected growth of the industry, the direction of the company, and the execution of the team - I think this achievable. But make your own judgements.

**Margin of Safety**

With my assumptions, I arrive at a 'Total Present Value' of $13.1B, and a 'Fair Value Share Price' of $29.28. But let's be careful about what this means.

*The value of $29.28 is not a price target. It needs to be viewed in the context of 'Margin of Safety'.*

Based on my assumptions and at a share price of $29.28, I believe RKLB is likely to deliver a return equal to my 'Discount Rate' of 7.81%.

Would I buy at $29.28? No! I want a margin of safety.

By applying a margin of safety, I can still expect to make a decent return even if things go wrong. Like the company delivers a fraction of the free cash flow, or the risk-free rate climbs higher than I expected.

**TLDR** \- At a current share price of $9.05, I see a margin of safety of 69% - which I am certainly comfortable with. I'd be pretty comfortable investing at a share price of anything up to about $20. But this must be a personal decision made by each investor.

This is my opinion based on assumptions I am comfortable with. Price targets don't interest me, I'm not a short-term speculator. I care about long-term intrinsic value and DCF is the goal standard tool for assessing that.

*At the time of writing, my main equal-weight space holdings are: RKLB, RDW, VLD. My speculative small holdings are: PL, ASTS, ASTR, SPCE, BKSY.*

*I am not a financial advisor, just some ape on Reddit, please make your own judgements.*

RKLB_posts.csv,Bought More RKLB 1/21 On Opportunity + Company Observations,"A reader suggested that I move this over to the main board after asking some questions. I am adding some additional information with links from my 1/21 post in the Daily Discussion Thread:

I bought much more Rocket Lab  today (1/21). I believe were are **nearing** a bottom - the S&P Short-term oscillator was -4 yesterday (1/20), and it should be -5 at least today. That's the buy signal for the oscillator and me, however, the market has been known stagnate. The oscillator does not drive the market it is a result of the market. It is an indicator of overbought/oversold conditions.

Today was also a major options expiry. Options are now the big game over the stock plays. This observation is supported in a link.  If you know about programmed trading and ""Max Pain"" theory then you'll know the enormous incentive to push down stocks into expiry and have most of them expire worthless. January is the biggest play followed by July and third Fridays of the month. Stocks usually bounce up 2-3 days later after settlement date. Of course, Fed move anxieties (inflation, interest rates) are presently the core down driver with options expiry exacerbating this. Given all that and being in correction territory for some indices I started buying more.

These are not the fundamental bases for me buying Rocket Lab. I buy stocks based on their leadership, culture and potential. I identify Peter Beck as a great and honest leader. He has built something remarkable. I detect the same with Adam Spice the CFO.

You can see some important underlying qualities in leadership when they are under pressure. Look how Peter Beck behaves when they lose a mission - apologies, sincerity and honesty. Honesty like the 'eating his hat' display. I had some email exchanges with Adam Spice the CFO and also he is running Investor Relations. That is one busy man and when I did not get a sufficient answer to an inquiry I had made I gave him a difficult reply. He made a a respectful recovery with more effort and I was impressed. I told him so and ended up with an invite to tour the Rocket Lab facilities in Long Beach. These are a few qualities that lead up to producing a great and prolific company culture.

My background is Aerospace (USAF pilot, NASA programs) and running corporations. The way Rocket Lab is approaching space expansion and their business model I think is the best. Will their be problems and learning curves - certainly. Aerospace is difficult - atmospheric ops are hard and space is even harder.

I have been actively investing and trading for 35 years. When you see companies making a turn around like GE under Larry Culp you can observe qualities in their leadership and experiences. I bought GE at $5 ($40 after the reverse split) and that investment turned out productive.  I see similar qualities in leadership at Rocket Lab. So that's what I am really buying given the opportunity the market is providing. For me RKLB is an investment, not a trade. I am long-term and patient.

It was clear to me the program trading on RKLB Friday (1/21) was a mirror to the indices. The DOW, NAS and S&P were in sync that day as in the day before. I did see what appeared to be support in the last minutes to finish RKLB at 9 with increasing bid and ask to hold it there, and it did. That was planned. 

So I picked up 4K more. If we go up I'm happy, if it goes down I'll consider buying more and bring my average down.  Leadership, culture and a good business model gives vision the best chance. The market brings opportunity. Good luck to everyone.

Updates: The S&P Short-term oscillator was at -6 on 1/21 at market close.

The proposed changes could help ease congestion at the country‚Äôs other spaceports, which have felt the strain of a rapid increase in launch capacity due primarily to SpaceX. That strain is projected to only worsen as companies, including Rocket Lab, Relativity, Blue Origin and others, aim to bring new rockets online in the next few years.

RKLB_posts.csv,Billionaire Ken Fisher Pours Money Into These 2 ‚ÄòStrong Buy‚Äô Stocks - RKLB,"In the world of stock legends, Ken Fisher stands out. The legendary investor founded his private financial advisory firm, Fisher Investments, in 1979, with just $250 in seed money. Today, Fisher‚Äôs company manages over $195 billion in total assets, and his personal net work exceeds $5 billion.

Fisher has cast his eye on current market conditions. In recent published note, Fisher points out the obvious headwinds in the current environment: ‚ÄúFear of the impact of the tragic, grinding war in Ukraine and hot overseas inflation. Fear of the ‚Äòtightening‚Äô at central banks across the world hurting China‚Äôs export demand. And prolonged Covid restrictions in Shanghai and Beijing. All this and more has torpedoed global sentiment thus far this year.‚Äù

It's a dark picture, true. But Fisher also sees hope ahead for investors, and that hope is part and parcel of the very pressures that investors are facing. He writes, ‚ÄúBeneath the sour surface lurk powerful positives... Their stealthy presence amid widespread gloom upends global recession fears and provides evidence that brighter days are ahead‚Ä¶‚Äù He describes the current conditions as ""exactly the kind of broad pessimism that new bull markets are born in.""

Turning to Fisher for inspiration, we took a closer look at two stocks Fisher's firm made moves on recently. Using TipRanks‚Äô database to find out what the analyst community has to say, we learned that each ticker boasts a ‚ÄúStrong Buy‚Äù consensus rating from the analyst community and massive upside potential.

\[Here is the Rocket Lab USA portion\]

Rocket Lab USA (RKLB)

From e-commerce we‚Äôll move over to space flight. While Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX has hogged the headlines in the private venture space industry, it‚Äôs far from the only game in town. Rocket Lab is a space-launch company with a reusable small launch vehicle, the Electron, capable of inserting 300kg payloads into low Earth orbit. The Electron rocket is the only reusable small launch vehicle currently in service, and is in high demand ‚Äì Rocket Labs has made 26 successful launches since introducing it, and deployed 146 satellites.

Rocket Lab is working to expand the launch options available to customers with the development of the Neutron launch vehicle. The Neutron, when complete, will operate in the 8-ton payload class, and will be able to launch cargos capable of leaving Earth orbit altogether. The US Space Force last year awarded Rocket Lab a $24 million contract for development work on the upper stage of the Neutron vehicle.

In addition to its launch vehicle, Rocket Lab offers customers access to the Photon spacecraft, a small-size configurable vehicle launched as the upper stage of an Electron rocket. The Photon can be optimized for low- and mid-altitude Earth orbits, geosynchronous orbits, or even extra-Earth flights to the Moon or the nearby planets Mars and Venus. There are currently 2 Photon spacecraft orbiting Earth. In late May, Rocket Lab announced that its customer Varda Space Industries, which had previously ordered 3 Photon spacecraft, had increased its order to 4.

Also in May, Rocket Lab announced that the CAPSTONE spacecraft, a joint operation undertaken on contract with NASA, had been delivered to its New Zealand launch facility. Rocket Lab will now begin integrating CAPSTONE with the launch vehicle, as part of a long-duration NASA mission to the Moon.

This space launch company has proved of interest to Fisher, who recently bought up 538,913 shares of RKLB. His stake in the company is worth $2.62 million at current share prices.

Rocket Lab has also caught the attention of Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu, who writes: ‚ÄúIn our view, the company‚Äôs growth and margins across various business lines are set to inflect over the next year and its new larger Neutron rocket will be fully sold out for at least 2-3 years even before its maiden voyage. Moreover, we think its Space Systems segment remains unappreciated despite winning the landmark Globalstar/MDA contract which surprised many legacy competitors.""

""Looking ahead, the stock may be volatile due to tactical factors (growth sell-off, shift in shareholder base, etc‚Ä¶) but we think the enormous disconnect in valuation will likely compress relative to SpaceX which in the private market was reportedly seeking a $127bn valuation just a few days ago (RKLB now trading at only \~$2bn),"" the analyst added.

Yu brings a Buy rating for the stock along with his comments, and his price target here, at $14 per share, suggests \~189% upside for the year ahead.

His Wall Street peers are also upbeat on the prospects for Rocket Lab, as shown by the 4 to 1 breakdown in analyst reviews, favoring Buys over Holds and supporting a Strong Buy consensus view. The shares are selling for $4.86 and the $14.10 average price target implies a high 191% upside this year. (See RKLB stock forecast on TipRanks)

RKLB_posts.csv,Rocket Lab's tech is extremely valuable,"With interest rates rising, any company that's not immediately profitable or has a high P/E has its valuation questioned. Rocket Lab is no exception. One of the things that gives me confidence in Rocket Lab is the strong leadership and management. Another one is the diversification beyond just launch services. But I think it's also important to realize that Rocket Lab's tech is extremely valuable.

Rocket Lab is not a software company. The technology stack that they own and what they've perfected is not easily replicated by anyone anywhere. It took them 16 years to get where they are today. They have the ability to launch payloads into orbit. This is an ability that many sovereign nations don't even have (but wish they did) and it's extremely valuable. Not just for communication satellites, but also because of its military potential. Rocket Lab can launch spy satellites, and if things were to really go south, Electron could be turned into an ICBM.

With satellite mega-constallations soon on the horizon, we have a situation where right now, Starlink is kicking everyone's ass. They're way ahead of everybody else in this race. I don't think that Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and all of the big telecom players are going to want to let this play out. I think it hasn't fully dawned on them yet, but soon enough, they're going to realize how bad of a position they're in. The realization might start to hit them around the time that Starlink starts opening up registrations to the broader public. There's going to be a rush into space tech investments, and Rocket Lab will be at the top of the list. Google or Amazon could easily invest a billion or two or four into the company. They might even try to buy them outright (which I hope they don't agree to), but either way, I think it's extremely unlikely this decade that Rocket Lab could ever go bankrupt or have any difficulty finding investors. I also think it's unlikely that the market cap could dip much below where it is for long, because everyone is going to want a piece of that space pie.

Today‚Äôs consensus seems to tilt toward the narrative that the lack of announced Neutron progress is holding the stock price down. I think that that‚Äôs correct. However the relative impact Neutron has will likely shift as conditions evolve. Non-Neutron related developments that might impact the company‚Äôs success include:

* Space Systems wins a >$1 billion government contract (or two, or three, ‚Ä¶)

* New vertical product lines or horizontal core capabilities
* Significant revenue increases (>75% YOY) and the benefits that come with scale
* Key hires of ‚Äúmagicians‚Äù with track records of pulling rabbits out of a hat
* Wildly successful missions

Neutron will remain important until that line of launch capabilities is retired a decade or two into the future.

RKLB_posts.csv,$RKLB eligible to bid for NASA's TROPICS mission launch service (After Astra failed in 2022),"[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-maintains-contractual-relationship-with-astra-presses-forward-with-tropics-mission](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-maintains-contractual-relationship-with-astra-presses-forward-with-tropics-mission)  


Recognizing the urgent science needs, NASA is adjusting its launch services plan to complete the timely launch of a CubeSat constellation designed to improve understanding of tropical cyclones.

The agency‚Äôs Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats ([TROPICS](https://weather.msfc.nasa.gov/tropics/)) mission launch service now will be competed under the agency‚Äôs Venture-Class Acquisition of Dedicated and Rideshare ([VADR](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/12-companies-to-provide-venture-class-launch-services-for-nasa)) IDIQ contract targeting the 2023 hurricane season.

NASA and Astra also have agreed to modify its existing launch services contract, originally planned for the agency‚Äôs TROPICS constellation, for the launch of comparable scientific payloads on Astra‚Äôs Rocket 4.0 in the future.

NASA [selected](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-launch-service-contract-for-tropics-mission-to-study-storm-processes) commercial partner Astra in 2021 to provide launch services for TROPICS across three launches using the company‚Äôs Rocket 3.3 launch vehicle. On June 12, 2022, after a nominal first-stage flight, the upper stage of Astra‚Äôs Rocket 3.3 shut down early and failed to deliver the first two TROPICS CubeSats to orbit. NASA currently is participating in the launch investigation, led by Astra and the Federal Aviation Administration.

Following the first TROPICS launch attempt, Astra and NASA engaged in discussions¬†regarding the remaining launch attempts. Astra then notified NASA of its intent to discontinue its Rocket 3.3 and indicated the company would potentially not resume launches prior to the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season. The VADR contract allows the 13 companies [selected this year](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/13-companies-to-provide-venture-class-launch-services-for-nasa) to compete for the rebid of the TROPICS launch services, giving the agency and external stakeholders the ability to use TROPICS data sooner.

TROPICS is an Earth venture mission ‚Äì science-driven, competitively selected, low-cost missions that provide opportunity for investment in innovative Earth science to enhance our capability to better understand the current state of the Earth system and to enable continual improvement in the prediction of future changes. NASA is committed to helping grow the U.S. commercial launch market while enabling the agency‚Äôs science missions. The VADR contract allows NASA to nurture the emerging commercial market by awarding launch providers more risk-tolerant payloads such as TROPICS.

RKLB_posts.csv,Did you know you bought into a conglomerate? A look into Rocket Lab and it's subsidiaries.,"As soon as you bought into VACQ, or RKLB, you bought into a micro aerospace conglomerate. It's small, with some fresh acquisitions, but it has room to grow. As soon as Rocket Lab acquired Sinclair Interplanetary back in March/April of 2020 it began it's transition to a conglomerate. Then it solidified that when they acquired three more companies. I've been researching those companies and think I know how they'll help. This started the other day when I was thinking if there was anything to the different amounts paid for the acquisitions[not just total but characteristics as well]. I don't have any definitive answer to that still, but found out more about how one of them may point to some answers.

On paper Solaero was the most at 80million dollars, that's the most recent acquisition and it still needs to be finalized. Planetary Systems Corporation was next at 42M +1.72M shares, so around 60 million(they also had 2022 and '23 bonus possibilities). Advanced Solutions, Inc. was next at 40 million with a possible 5million extra based on their own 2021 fiscal results. I don't know what they paid for Sinclair, Rocket Lab wasn't a publicly traded company and the details were not disclosed. They're all subsidiaries that continue to operate as they did before, completing their prior contracts. But now Rocket Lab gets to utilize them.

Starting with Sinclair Interplanetary a satellite component company. That acquisition was almost complete in March 2020 when covid hit, I'm glad neither of them backed out of the deal. Sinclair Interplanetary(Ontario) makes satellite components such as tourque rods, star trackers, and reaction wheels. A few months ago Rocket Lab announced the expansion of their reaction wheel production to a target of 2000 a year. I'll get back to that later. Currently SI has components on many different satellites, some of which are clients of RL. Blacksky for example. I assume photon will be using a lot of their components so that's how Sinclair will help in the future.

Advanced Solutions, Inc.(Colorado) is a flight software company. They provide a range of software to help plan and execute your mission. They're a little hard for me to understand everything they do. They have products on some interesting current and upcoming missions[OsirisREx and the Orion Capsule]. The thing I think they'll help with early is the Neutron return to launch site landing. Beck mentioned targeting being the part they have a concern will be difficult, so I think that's a major reason they acquired them. That and constellation management. 

Planetary Systems Corporation(Maryland) is a satellite separation company. They build components for a handful of launch provides including Space X. Each satellite needs to be detached or dispensed from the upper stage of the rocket. On the Rocketlab website you can find their flight heritage, including some Cygnus missions. I was hopefull they used them for satge separation of the capsule, but it looks like they use the capsule as a bus and distributed satellites. I still think they'll be advisors on the Neutron hung stage separation. Anyone have thoughts on PSC and why they're the only company that took shares, also they have the better looking bonus, almost 1 million more shares depending on 2022 and 2023 results. 

Solaero Technologies(New Mexico) is a aerospace solar panel company, one of the two major US companies. Spectrolab, under Boeing, is the other one. Solero has a large group of facilities in Albuquerque. They make many types of solar panels, some of which are on the James Webb Space Telescope. They have some experience with composites which may benefit Rocket Lab. They can also produce enough to supply constellations, which makes one of their major clients very interesting. [This](https://spacenews.com/after-bankruptcy-onewebs-supply-chain-looking-for-new-ways-to-keep-busy/) article is about OneWeb, another company like Starlink that is trying to establish high speed internet in low earth orbit.

 Before you read it let me give you some more background. First the article is almost two years old. Currently OneWeb is well past the halfway point of getting their **initial** constellation completed with 394 satellites in orbit and only 1 of them failing. They launch with the Soyuz rocket up to a higher than average altitude. They are up 1200km where they are higher than the majority of other spacecraft already in orbit, as well as debris. What looks like a red flag may have a silver lining. They filed for bankruptcy during March 2020, claiming covid as the main cause. From there the government of the United Kingdom stepped in to bail them out and are now one of their owners. Then a Billionaire who started one of the largest conglomerates that serves India and parts of Africa also bought in. Sunil Bharti Mittal owns around 40% of OneWeb, and is in a position to serve India 1.3B population and Nigeria the seventh most populated country at 200M. As well as other countries in the region. Eutelsat has a 20% stake, and as the name implies they have Europe covered. The company recently opened an assembly plant right by the Cape on Merritt Island. They are trying to get to a assembly rate of 2 satellites a day. That's where Solaero is sending its panel's to be put on a unit. Which gets shipped to Russia then placed in Orbit. 

**Does any of this matter past the solar panels?**

It might not. Although I do think the reaction wheel ramp up may be significant. **I'm not implying Rocket Lab is merging or signing some exclusive partnership with them, I'm just saying they can be a growing component supplier to Onewebs line of  satellites**. When you read the article it sounds like they have star trackers covered so forget those. I checked PSC's heritage and they've never sold anything to them from what I can tell. Could they use some John's Hopkins University radios on them? Maybe not now but on the next generation satellites? 

This [article ](https://solaerotech.com/solaero-technologies-powers-onewebs-satellite-constellation/) is from 10 months ago, it just shows Onewebs relationship with Solaero.

[Here's the SpaceNews archive on Oneweb](https://spacenews.com/tag/oneweb/)some good reading material positive and negative. Proposed mega constellation going from 46,000 to just 6,000. Or the 200 million they're getting from the Saudi government. 

They launch out of Russia and Kazakhstan. Those two are having problems but I just saw it's cooling off. I could see them wanting to move away from using them and buying some Neutron launches.

There was that news recently about India telling Starlink to stop selling units without a license. One more thing I thought was odd was of the list of companies applying for FCC approved satellites. Astra had 13000, and Rocket Lab wasn't on the list.

If at the end of the day they just have a large order of reaction wheels to go with the solar panels to keep them busy the next 2-3 years while they develop Neutron. Well then I couldn't ask for more than that.

I have optimism that once the Solaero deal is finalized we'll hear more details about what they have planned in the near term. When talking about the reaction wheels, I think I remember Beck commenting that they aren't just building them for the fun of it, they have clients lined up.",52,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/s3ny6o/did_you_know_you_bought_into_a_conglomerate_a/,0.998,0.097,0.875,0.028

We are coming off a consolidation phase and a gap up occurred today. From a technicals point of view,

1. There was a shooting star candlestick pattern on 10/24. Stock dipped by about 15% from a high of 12.09 to a low $10.16 on 10/31.  After this it crossed $13.
2. No major catalysts during this period. 
3. MACD's are crossing over and turning positive

The setup is incredible going into the earnings. I love this uptrend and I am betting that SPB has some great news to share on the earnings call. IMO, There are people seeing ""A secular trend"" and that's the driver for this momentum.  I mentioned this in my previous post. Other than that, I have no inside information.

PS: To newbie options players. This is not the best time to sell CC's. Option buyers, the premiums are just too high. Nov15 $17 1254 contracts were traded for $0.12. That's ridiculous. Don't throw away your money. **Sometimes, you miss the boat. Accept it. Don't chase it. Buy shares instead.**

The new device is based on an inverted metamorphic multi-junction (IMM) cell technology developed by Rocket Lab‚Äôs unit Solaero. The cell can be used in applications in the civil, military, and commercial space markets.

**MARCH 10, 2022** [**EMILIANO BELLINI**](https://www.pv-magazine.com/author/emilianobellini/)   
 

US-based aerospace manufacturer and small satellite launch service provider [Rocket Lab USA Inc](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/16/us-aerospace-manufacturer-rocket-lab-takes-over-space-solar-cell-maker-solaero/) has presented a new space-grade solar cell based on a cell technology developed by space solar cell maker [Solaero](https://www.pv-magazine.com/press-releases/solaero-technologies-to-work-with-johns-hopkins-university-applied-physics-laboratory-on-aerovironment-puma-solar-wing-production-design/), which it acquired in December.

The new product, dubbed IMM-Œ≤, is an evolution of Solaero's inverted metamorphic multi-junction (IMM) solar cell, based on indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) and developed by scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/09/nrel-scientists-test-back-contact-architecture-on-perovskite-solar-cells/) (NREL).

‚ÄúThe IMM-Œ≤ solar cell is expected to be the highest-efficiency space solar cell technology in high-volume production,‚Äù the manufacturer said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe cell boasts an average 33.3% beginning of life (BOL) efficiency, up from 32% for the IMM-Œ± that is currently in volume production.‚Äù

According to Solaero's website, the IMM-Œ± solar cell has a thickness of 150Œºm and a mass of 49mg/cm2, which represents a 42% reduction as compared to conventional multi-junction, space-grade solar cells.

The new cell can be used in applications in the civil, military and commercial space markets. ‚ÄúThe IMM-Œ≤ is also a radiation-hard cell with a power remaining factor of 87% after exposure to 1-MeV electrons at a fluence of 1E15 e/cm2 or equivalent of about 15 years life,‚Äù Rocket Lab stated. ‚ÄúNow undergoing final space qualification testing, the cells are expected to be ready for commercial use later in 2022.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIn partnership with our colleagues at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), we‚Äôre not only commercializing the world‚Äôs highest efficiency and lightest weight space solar cell, we‚Äôre doing so at the most competitive cost of any IMM technology to date. IMM-Œ≤'s impact on solar array and launch mass will make it a compelling option for satellite integrators,‚Äù said Solaero CEO Brad Clevenger.

Solaero operates an 11,000m¬≤ manufacturing facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where it produces different kinds of space solar cells.

These include a 30%-efficient four-junction device on a germanium substrate; a 30.2%-efficient triple-junction solar cell optimized for low earth orbit (LEO) applications; a 29.5%-efficient, standard triple-junction cell based on indium gallium phosphide (InGaP), indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) and germanium (Ge); a 29.4%-efficient triple-junction device based on a germanium substrate; and the above-mentioned IMM-Œ± cell, with an efficiency of 32%.

RKLB_posts.csv,Everyday Astronaut video about New Glenn,"This post is actually about Rocket Lab & Neutron, not a Blue Origin advertisement.

I really highly recommend watching Everyday Astronaut‚Äôs latest YouTube video with Jeff Bezos & New Glenn Factory. It confirmed three things I‚Äôve personally thought are Rocket Labs clear advantages with Neutron.

1. Carbon composite gives you best performance and is clearly the best material choice. Downside to this is iterating the rocket design is not realistic so you have to get it right with the first design. Rocket Lab already did exactly this with Electron.

2. Reusable fairings attached to the 1st stage are an excellent idea to reduce cost.

3. If you can make the 2nd stage cheap enough, you will never have to deal with the problems that a reusable 2nd stage will have. Blue Origin is also attempting this. They‚Äôre (in parallel) designing a reusable 2nd stage and another ‚Äùas cheap as possible‚Äù expendable 2nd stage. Bezos said if they can make the expendable 2nd stage very cheap, then it doesn‚Äôt make economical sense to attempt to reuse it. 

What are these 2nd stage problems I mentioned? Look at what Starship has to deal with on re-entry. Combine that with the extra weight of the stainless steel, fuel, heat shielding that is required to make it reusable. That‚Äôs weight that could be used to deliver extra payload to orbit. (I know I know, Starship is designed for interplanetary travel etc. so re-entry is a requirement)

Rocket Lab is purely going for a 2nd stage that is as cheap and as light as possible. I think this will prove to be the right choice. There‚Äôs a lot of reasons why and are mostly related to economics and performance of the overall vehicle.

For example the empty weight for the 2nd stage of a Falcon 9 is 3900kg. Peter Beck has stated the 2nd stage of Neutron is roughly the same weight as a Harley Davidson motorcycle so around 300-400kg. That‚Äôs a big difference.

After watching the video I have a lot more respect for Jeff Bezos & Blue Origin.

There just doesn‚Äôt seem to be a reason to be nervous in RKLB. They are transparent, smart and moving at a solid pace with enough money to last a while. 

The demand for space tech will really kick in when there are breakthroughs in profitable manufacturing/research that can only be done in low gravity, space exploration that needs constant support or a bit further down the line mining. The first two seem within reach in the next few years and the later, will need to happen‚Ä¶ just hard to predict when. In the meantime plenty of satellites to practice with.

RKLB_posts.csv,RKLB - Fair Value DCF Analysis,"In my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/t4cd4b/i_think_simply_wall_st_have_this_right/), I shared the valuation of Rocket Lab as calculated by Simply Wall St. That valuation put the fair of the value share price at $38.16. Which implies the stock currently trades at a discount of 75%. Nice if true right?

Let's take a look at the detail. so that we can interrogate the assumptions. Simply Wall St have selected a '2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity' Discounted Cash Flow analysis (DCF). This is a widely accepted tool to value growth companies.

For those not familiar with a DCF, here's a quick primer. A DCF values a company by estimating the future *free cash flow* generated by the company over its entire lifetime - the so called *future value*.

Free cash flow is basically the money the company will have left to pay its shareholders after paying all its bills. It might pay that money to shareholders in the form of dividends or share buybacks.

But we must take into account the time value of money - that is, money now, is worth more than money in the future. Because money you have now can be invested and generate a return. Therefore, we must *discount* the future value of cash flows to their current value - the *present value*.

The discount rate used by Simply Wall St

|Discount Rate||
|:-|:-|
|Risk-Free Rate|1.92%|
|Equity Risk Premium|4.24%|
|Industry Levered Beta|0.927|
|**Discount Rate**|**5.85%**|

The 'Risk-Free Rate' is the rate of return you could achieve by simply holding risk-free US Government Bonds to maturity.

The 'Equity Risk Premium' is the extra return you should receive for holding a risky asset like a stock. SWS have used the risk premium of the S&P Global as the value here.

The 'Industry Levered Beta' is a measure of the risk within the Aerospace & Defense industry. A lower value is considered less risky than a higher value.

The formula for the discount rate is then:

    Discount Rate = Risk-Free Rate + (Industry Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)

Therefore, we have a discount rate of 5.85%. This is the annual rate by which we must discount future cash flows. I find it helpful to think of this as being the rate of return you might achieve if you bought the stock at the fair value as calculated by the DCF.

Looking now to the future value, SWS splits this into 2 stages. The 1st stage assumes the company grows substantially for the next 10 years, based on analyst estimates. The 2nd stage assumes that the company grows in perpetuity at the risk-free rate.

Future & Present Value of next 10 years

|1st Stage|Free Cash Flow ($M)|Present Value ($M)|Source|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2022|\-67|\-63|Analyst x2|
|2023|\-55|\-49|Analyst x1|
|2024|64|54|Analyst x2|
|2025|111|88|Analyst x1|
|2026|268|202|Analyst x1|
|2027|413|293|Est @ 53.96%|
|2028|571|383|Est @ 38.35%|
|2029|727|462|Est @ 27.42%|
|2030|871|522|Est @ 19.77%|
|2031|997|565|Est @ 14.42%|
|TOTAL|3,900|2,457||

Here we see that SWS estimates Rocket Lab's free cash flow over the next ten years to be $3.9B (future value). Remember, that's the money the company will have left over after paying all its bills. It's a measure of profitability.

We discount the future value by 5.85%, to work out how much that money is worth now. The present value of 1st stage future cash flows is therefore circa $2.5B. Money in the future, is worth less than money now.

The 2nd stage of the DCF assumes that the company will grow cash flows at the risk-free rate in perpetuity to arrive at the *terminal value* (the future value of the 2nd stage). Which is again discounted to the present value.

Future & Present Value of subsequent years

|2nd Stage|Terminal Value ($M)|Present Value ($M)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Stable Growth in Perpetuity|25,849|14,639|

There are widely accepted formulas to calculate these values, where growth (g) = risk-free rate.

    Terminal Value = FCF(2031) * (1 + g) / (Discount Rate - g)
    Terminal Value = 997 * (1 + 1.92%) / (5.85% - 1.92%)
    
    Present Value = Terminal Value / (1 + Discount Rate)^10
    Present Value = 25,849 / (1 + 5.85%)^10

Here we see that the future value of the second stage is estimated at $25.8B, which is discounted to a present value of $14.6B.

Then we sum the present value of both stages, to arrive at a fair value share price

|Valuation||
|:-|:-|
|Total Present Value ($M)|17,096|
|Shares Outstanding (M)|449|
|Fair Value Per Share ($)|38.08|
|Current Share Price ($)|9.10|
|Current Discount to Fair Value|76.1%|

**Assumptions**

This analysis estimates that the future value of all free cash flow generated by Rocket Lab over its entire lifetime at $29.7B. The present value of that cash flow is estimated at $17.1B.

The main variables in this analysis are the risk-free rate, the equity risk premium, and of course the estimates of free cash flows for the next ten years. Particularly the value of FCF for 2031, because this is used directly to calculate the terminal value - which is by far the largest element of the valuation.

The risk-free rate is based on the yield from US Government Bonds. An increase in bond yields will lead to a higher discount rate. This makes sense because you could get a better return without taking risk. So, the present value of future cash flows would decrease, and so would the fair value of the stock. This is why rising bond yields put such downward pressure on growth stock valuations - as we have seen recently.

Similarly, an increase in the equity risk premium would cause the fair value to fall. This might happen if investors become more bearish on stocks in general, such as during times of global uncertainty.

**TLDR** \- By far the biggest influence on the fair value, are the estimates of free cash flow for the next 10 years. Particularly the value in 2031. Whether you are confident in this valuation really comes down to whether or not you can see Rocket Lab generating a free cash flow of circa $1B in 2031.

**If you disagree with the valuation, which part of the analysis do you challenge and why?**

RKLB_posts.csv,Its a great company but is it a good stock?,"I love the progress Rocket Lab and strongly believe in Peter beck. But at current valuation is it a good stock?

Sure based on past pricing $4 is a good price. But at absolute level, will it give enough return for the underlying risk of investing in a pre-profit company. Let me make a reasonable bullish calculation, assuming how RKLB would be priced if was a net profit optimized growing company

As per their [SPAC ppt](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/assets/Rocket-Lab-Investor-Presentation.pdf), they are expecting to reach revenue of $1.57 billion by quarter ending Feb 2028.

I know RKLB is now focusing more on revenue than profit, so let me borrow profit margin from LMT (9.55%, 5y avg), NOC (11.66, 5y avg) (which are mature, so I believe would be reasonable margin RKLB would strive to achieve). Assuming profit margin of 12% and revenue of $1.57bil. It brings net profit to $188 million.  Lets slap a imaginary PE of 30, since they would still be growing. So the Market Cap comes to 5.6 billion (assuming no dilution). Assuming 5% dilution, Market cap comes to 5.3 billion at Feb 2028.

This gives CAGR at the higher end of 20s. While this is good returns, I feel there are lot of bullish assumptions baked into valuation. I feel investing in some stock like Google feels a better bet, interms of risk reward ratio. For a potential CAGR of 20%, does the risk worth it, when there is a possibility of bankruptcy ( even though I feel its impossible when beck is around, but still I feel this should be taken into account).

Unless beck comes with awesome space application idea after Neutron, I don't know if we would go above 10 billion Market cap

What do you think of my argument? I am new to investing and didn't know how else to value a pre profit company. Let me know your thoughts

RKLB_posts.csv,Only the strong survive‚Ä¶ the great SPAC attack of 2019,"The year is 2019‚Ä¶ 

Virgin Galactic merges with SCH to create SPCE, ushering in a new age of retail space investing‚Ä¶

Virgin Galactic, rooted in the genius of legendary aerospace designer Burt Rutan and Scaled Composites, becomes a public company via Richard Branson‚Ä¶

Virgin Galactic promises a bright future for future space tourists and investors. 

Branson would later take small satellite launcher, Virgin Orbit (VORB), public via merger with NextGen Acquisition Corp. 

Virgin Orbit wants it all. 

On September 25, 2020‚Ä¶ Vector Acquisition Corp goes public. 

On August 25, 2021,‚Ä¶ a young, fledgling space startup company founded by rocket bike connoisseur, New Zealander, gold-prospector, and cabbage patch look-alike, Peter Beck, merges with VACQ.

Rocket Lab enters the commercial space race as a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ. But legacy space and defense contractors dismiss RocketLab‚Äôs Electron rocket as too small for doing serious rocketry. 

It is early 2023‚Ä¶

After a global pandemic and nuclear winter for raising capital, the shakeout is in full swing. Space launch startups like Astra, Relativity, and Branson‚Äôs Virgin Orbit are teetering on the brink.  Claims of large 2B backlogs and realities of horizontal flying rockets will not save them from impending doom. 

On April 4, 2023, Branson‚Äôs Virgin Orbit files for bankruptcy, crushing hopes of a free satellite launching future not dominated by old school contractors and the SpaceX monopoly. 

The demand for satellite constellations and real-time global connectivity grows. 

It is June 20th 2024‚Ä¶

Rocket Lab successfully launches its 50th Electron mission, the fastest rocket to do so. Rocket Lab is also in full swing developing its medium lift Neutron rocket. 

It is August, 2024‚Ä¶

The archimedes engine breathes fire. People are skeptical of Neutron‚Äôs new engine, calling bullshit on Peter Beck for not releasing a long video of a hot fire.   

However, Peter Beck confirms a hot fire later in the month.  

The industry is put on check.

It is November 12, 2024‚Ä¶

In the Q3 earnings call, Peter Beck confirms Neutron is open for business. The first Neutron contract for a constellation operator has been confirmed. 

Will the future of affordable access to space and constellation building be dominated purely by the Falcon 9, Starship, Elon, and SpaceX????? ",45,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1gqxoqp/only_the_strong_survive_the_great_spac_attack_of/,-0.857,0.068,0.844,0.089

Tbh. that news is shocking. BlueOrigin spend billions of dollars and years of development (development started in 2011, was announced in 2014, first launch in January 2024) and right now they need 10 days to produce 1 engine?  
RocketLab started development of Archimedes in 2021, as a ox rich cycle in September 2022.  
We won't come by exact production numbers, but my educated guess is that they are currently producing about 1 engine per month.

In the Q2 earnings presentation they wrote that engine 2 were coming off the production line. 5 more were in production. And as Peter Beck wrote in context with the recent Archimedes video, engine number 3 already should fix the copper issue.

2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06). - this was true and we're now expecting much higher Q2 revenues (+30% QoQ) and another doubling of the backlog.
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars. - this still holds true, the demand for Electron was confirmed by the Synspective's order of 10 Electron launches and app. 7 HASTE launches between 2024 and 2025.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year. - Neutron will not launch this year but Kuiper satellites are still scheduled for the launch in the second half of this year.

My thesis is still intact. Even though it is too early to do the victory lap, RKLB is now mere 30% away from doubling since its all time lows and there are many catalysts on the horizon. For example, the upcoming Archie hot-fire test (I love that Archimedes' nickname), Ashlee Vance's Wild Wild Space documentary on HBO MAX, the common run up to the earnings report and, of course, the FOMC cutting the rates this year.

Let me know your opinion.

[My post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cfjtco/will_rklbs_share_price_double_this_year/) from 2024/04/29:

RKLB share price has a history of doubling from its low during the summer and then falling down to repeat the process next year. So far, it has happened every and each year since its listing on the stock market:

* **2021: $9.5 to $21.34 from 2021/08/27 to 2021/09/09**
* **2022: $3.53 to $7.15 from 2022/06/30 to 2022/08/12**
* **2023:**¬†**$3.76 to $8.05 from 2023/05/09 to 2023/07/19**

The 2024 low has been reached on 2024/4/16 at $3.47. What has changed from previous years besides the company's increased performance is that¬†**the reported short interest YTD has increased by 161% from 22m to 58m shorted shares**. This huge increase right before the summer may cause a bound of a violent volatility once the 2024 doubling commences.

RKLB trades so cheaply and it is so heavily shorted that all that may be needed to revalue its stock is a shift in sentiment. Right now the stock is pricing in the most bearish of bearish outcomes. Delayed Neutron development, increased R&D costs and Electron's obsolescence. But Rocket Lab is the only space company dedicated to being a one stop shop for space applications. Suppose over this year, the management can craft a narrative that Neutron is really coming this year/early next year and with it a significant decrease in R&D costs and the growth and capture of launch and space system markets. Such sentiment shift may take time but I don't know, there are so many unusual factors with Rocket Lab that I could see it happening rapidly.

I am not betting that Rocket Lab is going to stage the most epic growth of all time. I am just betting on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06).
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year.

August 8 is also RKLB earnings call date, but I wouldn‚Äôt read too much into that. The Aug 8th date on the SDA contract was last updated in March.

The big $515m contract that RL won early this year was for 18 T2TL Beta satellites. I believe this was the smallest of the Beta satellite awards.

The Alpha satellites were awarded to York Space and Northrop Grumman. I don‚Äôt think RKLB was in a position to compete for these at the time.

The Beta satellites were originally awarded to Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. The Rocket Lab award was added on later.

There are only 20 Gamma satellites, and SDA apparently plans to award them to just one company. I doubt they would go with a new company, since the Gamma sats are apparently similar to Alpha and especially Beta satellites. So no real speculation here, other than that Rocket Lab for sure competed for these, and is one of 4 options SDA would likely choose.

I was analyzing my portfolio and was wondering what the effect of a trump presidency would mean for RKLB, since I would imagine SpaceX will absorb most of the government contracts due to Elon musk being in close ties with Trump. I'm thinking this will push RKLB to push for a more commercial approach and less relient on government contracts. 

What do you think? I will say that I believe since RKLB is a fair bit smaller than SpaceX at this point. I doubt anything will really happen in terms of competitivity from SpaceX, but I'm wondering how you see RKLB in this situation. It might as well be that this presidency opens up new opportunities in terms of Space exploration.

Anyways, rocket Lab is really starting to disappoint me. I invested in this company mostly due to Peter Beck and his famous quote ""Do what you say you're going to do"". However for the last few months they've done the exact opposite!

1- They only launched electron 2 times Q4 of '23 when they said they would launch electron 3 times (Do what you say you're going to do)

2- They have not done the Archimedes hot fire test end of 2023 and have not even updated us about another more realistic timeline (Do what you say you're going to do)

3- They definitely will not launch electron 5 times this quarter, let's be real (Do what you say you're going to do) and I get obviously weather plays a role but tell me why SpaceX never seems to have these big weather problems and when they do it's pushed back a couple days not 10 days. I get it SpaceX is obviously heads over shoulders more advanced than RKLB but they really have to step up there game if they're really trying to compete with SpaceX anytime soon

4) Neutron will NOT launch in 2024 (do what you say you're going to do)

RKLB_posts.csv,RKLB will dive tomorrow,"RKLB looks like it has jumped today primarily due to posts on wallstreetbets about the stock before the launch tomorrow.

I‚Äôm feeling mixed emotions as i don‚Äôt really like this type of hype hitting the stock as the gains are unsustainable - and I can‚Äôt buy more around the $5 mark. But anyway i was buying at $10+ so that doesn‚Äôt really matter.

But anyway all of these people will see a (highly likely) successful launch tomorrow (largely business as usual) and a likely successful water recovery, my theory is that all of the people on wallstreetbets that would have bought this stock will do so today ahead of launch. Therefore after tomorrow the stock will dive as people get out again (wallstreetbets users not in it for the long run). 

Could be overly simplifying and a stupid take but almost considering selling some of my shares before close and buying back after the launch (when it could dip).

RKLB_posts.csv,"Quick write up after purchase of RKLB shares and options, launch next week","It‚Äôs kind of a weird stock for me, but I have been into RocketLab (RKLB) since ~4.20 or so, and feeling more confident about them recently.

they had a failed launch late summer, but they fixed it, got approval, and are going ahead with another launch next week. 

they recently failed to win amazon's satellite business, who went with spacex instead. 

those two things have really pushed the price down a lot in the last 6-9 months. 

however, they've inked new contracts recently, in part helped by virgin galactic folding. if next week's launch is successful, it could be a big shot in the arm. 

also, less tangible, musk and spacex have really dominated the private space industry, with a lot of massive govt contracts in the US and elsewhere. very little compitition from the likes of blue origin (dead) virgin galactic (dead), and even NASA. however, musk is increasingly toxic, questionable involvement in politics / war, non-us resident status, and a general aversion to monopoly in such a critical industry, all seem to limit the upside for complete spacex dominance. 

so I think there will be more room for companies like RKLB, both because the launch market will grow a lot in general and because spacex can't maintain their monopoly on it.

RKLB is moving quickly today / yesterday, so not sure if this is the time to buy. the launch next week is a safe bet, but no guarantee. 

last night I bought an $8 option to buy 100 shares at $5.50 dec 29, which is kind of a neat way to buy a bunch if the stock pops after the launch, without committing to actually owning the stock if the launch fails",0,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/18e4p5s/quick_write_up_after_purchase_of_rklb_shares_and/,-0.6337,0.129,0.73,0.141

RKLB_posts.csv,"If Trump wins, I'm selling.","I started thinking about the election and How it could affect Rocket Lab. And it dawned on me. Trump and Elon are best buddies. Of course Elon is going to use a Trump administration to kill off competition. Trump will direct every mission, NASA and DOD to SpaceX. He could even use the EPA to deny launch permits to any other company (who cares if it's BS, this is Trump world). This could kill Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, Axiom, Sierra, Relativity and any company that could compete with SpaceX in the future. This would be a tragedy for the whole industry that is just getting started. ULA will probably survive because they have been around the longest and have their own friends on capitol hill. But it will just be those two around SpaceX and ULA under Trump, that's my prediction.

On the Flip side if Kamala gets in I think they will actively divest from SpaceX wherever they can, due to Elon dislike. They'll be stuck using Dragon for a while because it's the most proven vehicle in the US (RIP Starliner). But I could see Dream Chaser getting another look from NASA. Neutron could get preferential treatment over Falcon 9 just to screw with SpaceX. A lot of competition could thrive under a democratic administration.

RKLB_posts.csv,"Space Systems is not profitable, not even close","I don't know why this keeps getting repeated around here, but Rocket Lab is burning cash at a high rate and it's not all Neutron. Space Systems and Launch are both losing money and don't seem likely to make a profit for many years. 

Look at their most recent annual report.

[https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1819994/000095017023006499/rklb-20221231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1819994/000095017023006499/rklb-20221231.htm)

**Page F-6: Income Statement**

$211M in revenues only produced a ""gross profit"" of $19M. Gross profit isn't a profit, it's the net revenues left over after the costs of production. Essentially its telling you that RL spent $192M building rockets and satellites to sell them for $211M ($19M more.)

**Rocket Lab lost $136M** because it spent $154M more on operating costs, which is R&D and SG&A ( Sales, General and Administrative). SG&A are things like rent, land costs, pad costs, finance, sales, software development, IT, customer service, advertising, licensing fees, boat costs, helicopter costs, etc, etc, etc.

Now if R&D ($65M) was 100% Neutron, they still would have lost $71M. But it can't be 100% Neutron. Satellites need R&D to improve and to be able to offer more features to customers. And even Electron still has R&D (attempted helicopter catches, anyone?), it still needs to improve and fix ongoing issues for customers even if its no longer the company focus.

**Page F-43 Segments**

This is the page that is leading people to make misleading claims that Space Systems is ""profitable"". It clearly states that Launch lost $7M and Space Systems made $26M in ""gross profit"". Again, this is just minus cost of goods sold (rocket/satellite manufacturing costs). It does not include all those operating costs.

Again, assuming the extremely unlikely scenario that all of R&D is Neutron, there is still $89M in SG&A. Space Systems was 70% of revenues, so if it was responsible for 70% of SG&A it would have lost $37M last year. If it was only 50% of SG&A it would have lost $19M.

**Page F-8 Cash Flow**

Separately someone said the CFO claimed that they'd be ""cash flow positive"" if not for Neutron spending. Looking at the cash flow statement tells you that's not very likely. First what is ""cash flow""? It's the amount of actual cash that the business generated during a period, which can often be different than it's reported loss/profit. This is because of things like new equipment purchases being amortized (expensed) over many years to match costs to usage. Or customers paying late, or early, the income statement just counts when the money was due, the cash flow statement counts when it actually arrived. 

First, their operations generated a negative operating cash burn of $106M in 2022. That doesn't include $42M in PPE (basically equipment purchases), which gives you -$148M ""Free Cash Flow"". FCF is an attempt to model how much cash a business generates for its owners, or if negative how much cash it needs to operate. Note that this is even higher than its reported loss from the income statement.

If we remove R&D, and PPE (107M) as ""Neutron"" expenses, they still would have had a negative $41M in free cash flow. So not even close. And it gets worse. The only reason they only burned $148M in FCF is that they gave employees stock options at a $55M discount to its true value (stock based compensation at top of operating cash flow list). That gets credited as ""cash flow from operations"" even though it didn't come from selling any launch or satellite, it came from selling cheap stock. And it means that if they had wanted to pay those employees market rate in cash, their accountants have estimated it would cost roughly another $55M.

But instead they gave out stock (18M shares in 2022, which would be worth $72M today). And will continue giving out a lot of stock since they can't afford to pay all cash. Which means that you will be getting diluted every year until they finally turn the corner on profitability and can afford to pay more cash.",11,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/127yu7h/space_systems_is_not_profitable_not_even_close/,0.8523,0.103,0.805,0.092

RKLB_posts.csv,Considering investing,"Hey there!

Invested in the wrong moment with Rocket Lab, early trading at ~15$. Since then I have looked at its performance and hasn‚Äôt liked it much.

I believe that the company has a small issue: very small launcher => no rideshares and only very expensive dedicated launches. With this, I see very hardly how it can compete with SpaceX.

However, with the recent transition to Space Systems, I am quite driven to re-invest. Is it a good moment now? Are shorts trying to drive it down atm? As a long termer I should not worry much about this, but at the same time having had a bad experience with it I‚Äôd like to reassure myself a bit more.

What are your counter arguments in support to holding RKLB long term (well beyond Neturon & profitability milestones)?

RKLB has high variance in possible outcomes in terms of return, hence by Jensen's inequality it must be overpriced currently.

RKLB is clearly in technological revolution category and while it may rise a lot in the near future, once it integrates into the economy and shifts from idiosyncratic to system risk, it may all deflate in the end.

RKLB_posts.csv,RKLB - Price movement for the week,"EDIT - Another good example of why, as a trader, we rely so heavily on confirmation candles (today isn't a good example of that, the day developed in regular trading hours). But knee jerk reactions cause ""disaster"". I was hopeful we'd maintain a hammer, but for whatever reason the price was pushed below $14. We simply won't know from this if the shift is significant or will be taken out tomorrow, etc.

I know there's a lot of TA naysayers but I nailed the last one and I believe I'll nail this one.

Here's why: Max pain is at $16 and everyone wants to fight over $16. I don't think it'll achieve $16, I wouldn't be surprised if it pins to around $14.50 (a historical strong point).

But today formed another hammer. I circled both hammers.

The importance of the hammer isn't its color (buy/sell candle) but it's shadow, which is very long (bottom thin line).

A hammer can't stand alone, it needs to be bookended by a downtrend on the one side and a confirmation candle on the other side (tomorrow's trading).

But, so far we have 2 of the 3 conditions.

So I think RKLB traders want to move the price to the next point of resistance which is the 20MA which is my default of the Bollinger Band.

Why a trader will do that? Well if a market maker can spike the price before options expiration (or plunge the price), they will do it....they'll only be held back by a market maker on the other side of the trade.

Think about it, wouldn't you love to be able to buy calls AND make the price MOON? Of course. So the battle is between those trading groups and that's where the balance is found. Any down-side trader is going to make a last stand over the 20MA.

If they can't hold its price under the 20MA often times they give-up and this leads to a gamma squeeze (as opposed to a pin).

I don't care to look at the GamEX anymore...it's tedious and not necessary, I'm willing to bet the GamEX (islands of stability) are about $14, and $16. So the fight will push the price to either side. And the $14ers were winning, but the hammer shows that they are pretty weak at $14. So if we have confirmation tomorrow, I'd say we can see a pretty strong bullish run to Friday (expiration date).

If you're a buyer, I wouldn't buy on FOMO on this one, a whole new battle starts over the Nov19 Expirys....could go either way.

If there's a really strong run, it'll Gamma explode, rather than pin.

If you're a seller wait until closer to Friday to consider taking profit.

&#x200B;

[Original hammer](https://preview.redd.it/17bm8u13p1t71.png?width=978&format=png&auto=webp&s=f678acd9e65d39511d2d9a44cfedae88bcf53a13)

&#x200B;

I don't see this as significant because I zoom in to a 15 minute chart and see that the sell-off was one large trading block and is looking to get ""taken out"".

The price isn't accepted at $13.60.

The lower price was achieved on lower volume.

Now to more fundamentals: it‚Äôs no surprise that this is due to the launch. Some hype is building up around this launch I believe, and there are two possible outcomes in my option:

- Either we have the same behaviour as last months: investors are not convinced yet and positive events (such as successful launches) drive the stock down. In this case, it would be smart to set some puts previous to the launch

- Investors are convinced with this launch and the stock soars

In my opinion, we will have something in between. The rule of three, right? Until we don‚Äôt see three successfull consecutive launches, nothing good will happen. So my guess is the launch will not really affect the stock.

All of this assuming it will go well! Haha

At the point when I made the decision to invest significantly in RKLB, I had the cash to invest. But my informed sense was that I was seeing RKLB‚Äôs potential well before the market was likely to respond fully to the opportunity. I also saw surmountable challenges ahead for the company. - Surmountable though likely to affect the share price along the way to overall success. I saw opportunity to incrementally lower my basis.

So I made what I considered to be a methodical set of purchases during the past several months as the price fell from near $8 down to almost $4. Because I‚Äôd already made some purchases going back to the¬†Vector Acquisition days, my basis ended up being about $6.75, which leaves me underwater today, though much less below the surface than I was before these purchases. The spreadsheet I used to track this process tells me that I was able to buy 25% more shares with the same amount of cash because of the methodology I used than would have been possible if I had just made a single purchase on the day I decided to up my investment.

RKLB_posts.csv,Will RKLB's share price double this year?,"RKLB share price has a history of doubling from its low during the summer and then falling down to repeat the process next year. So far, it has happened every and each year since its listing on the stock market:

* **2021: $9.5 to $21.34 from 2021/08/27 to 2021/09/09**
* **2022: $3.53 to $7.15 from 2022/06/30 to 2022/08/12**
* **2023:** **$3.76 to $8.05 from 2023/05/09 to 2023/07/19**

The 2024 low has been reached on 2024/4/16 at $3.47. What has changed from previous years besides the company's increased performance is that **the reported short interest YTD has increased by 161% from 22m to 58m shorted shares**. This huge increase right before the summer may cause a bound of a violent volatility once the 2024 doubling commences.

RKLB trades so cheaply and it is so heavily shorted that all that may be needed to revalue its stock is a shift in sentiment. Right now the stock is pricing in the most bearish of bearish outcomes. Delayed Neutron development, increased R&D costs and Electron's obsolescence. But Rocket Lab is the only space company dedicated to being a one stop shop for space applications. Suppose over this year, the management can craft a narrative that Neutron is really coming this year/early next year and with it a significant decrease in R&D costs and the growth and capture of launch and space system markets. Such sentiment shift may take time but I don't know, there are so many unusual factors with Rocket Lab that I could see it happening rapidly.

I am not betting that Rocket Lab is going to stage the most epic growth of all time. I am just betting on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06).
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year.

RKLB_posts.csv,For RKLB Options Traders,"Whether you are long or short on this stock, one of the best ways to increase your share position (DCA or otherwise) is to play options as well. I'm long on RKLB, some of you might remember my pompous post about buying $27k of it's stock a couple months ago at $3.85, using TA to find that ideal entry point.

Regardless, I want to suggest to the rest of the community my plays this upcoming week in options, and my plays this last week. Over the last 5 trading days I used options (primarily puts) for 179% gains, with a success rate of 92% among trades. The 4 stocks I traded were RKLB, SPCE, AMD, and QS.

As many of you know, RKLB and many others entered a downtrend the second half of last week. This trend will continue into this upcoming week, including RKLB. It will hit $5, and possibly the mid-4s. This isn't just guessing, it's the way the stock's sentiment is moving based on a number of underlying factors - factors that have never lead me wrong, barring major unexpected news. 

As such, on Monday morning I will be purchasing $5 puts, and later in the week, depending on how the trend continues, I will consider $4 puts. I don't have to hit the $4 strike price to profit off of $4 puts, I just need to ensure it heads in that direction substantially if I decide to buy them. 

You don't have to believe me, but I want to share this for those of you who are interested in profiting on the downtrend. SPCE will be doing the same, along with AMD, and many others. The one thing I don't know for certain is how long these downtrends will last, but I am positive it will be at least another 5 trading sessions.",8,39,https://i.redd.it/i38ounuajy7b1.png,0.9831,0.136,0.853,0.011

* For Launch
* For Satellite components

And it needs to show increasing backlogs.

None of this is any time soon. I think it's next earnings are not even scheduled officially, so we are hanging in the wind hoping for catalysts and New Zealand isn't making that easy.

RKLB_posts.csv,Get in while you can....,"This is a decent sign for the bulls.

I just don't think RKLB will present a lot of opportunity to buy below $14. Originally I called a support level around $15. I don't think a few days below $15 breaks that thesis. But $14 has been much more resilient in large part because RKLB is testing its daily 20MA.

I think it is shaping to pass that test.

Furthermore at the top arrow it is forming a hammer. That's an extremely bullish price action. If I were trading (I invest differently just FYI), then the next candle (Monday) would be looking for confirmation for a buy-signal.

Since I'm extremely bullish - today would probably be the best buy-in based on the hammer at the 20MA.

The volume toward end of day would be the best sign. Reversals happen around very low volume and are confirmed on increasing volume.

And so if the volume stays relatively low but increases each next day then this hammer could be the bottom for RKLB in the near term.

The Hammer has great shadow (or lower wick, the thin tail at the bottom).

It looks set up beautifully for Monday.

Bear DD > We are at a support level and testing it. The bottom could fall out and it could go to the next lower support level. If you are not extremely bullish, or have less intestinal fortitude, it wouldn't hurt to wait for Monday's trading to see confirmation of the candle.

Expectation of Thesis > Monday will gap up above today's high.

The closer look shows promising as well. On the 15 minute chart, RKLB has crossed its 20MA for the third time since it started selling off.

It gapped below 15 and thus below the 20MA and has been testing the 20MA as resistance (from below banging on the ceiling).

It may not recapture 15 very soon. But since it lost $15 share price when it lost the 20MA then this is the price it is testing.

When it breaks above the 20MA it will break toward $15.

Especially since its daily 20MA keeps moving upward into the $14 range.

EDIT - Last note - the Volatility ranking is as high now as it was the last time it made an upward move. Usually the volatility ranking is low (along the green dashed bottom) when a stock loses price. Since Implied Volatility is the amount of interest in the options of an underlying.

RKLB_posts.csv,Everything you should read if investing in Rocket Lab,"Key take aways:

* Amazon started at a loss - but had huge revenue growth.
* Amazon smashed the ""rule of 40"" benchmark. Revenue growth plus profit margin should be greater than 40.
* Amazon started with 11 employees, grew to 200+ by IPO.
* Amazon sold itself as capturing a bookselling market, a growing market of up to $20 billion per year by year 2000!
* Amazon today earns over 4x that entire market per quarter.
* Amazon made its own market.

The rest are my conclusions.

* RKLB rule of 40? Well its revenue growth is currently something on the order of 160% (conservative based on backlogs). Which smashes the hell out of the rule of 40 even without profits.
* RKLB and other new-space project the old market will grow to $1.5 Trillion.
* In reality. New Space will make its own market as Amazon did.

RKLB_posts.csv,What should be the entry target for next round of buying.,"I know we all love to think RKLB is breaking free of gravity, both literally into orbit and figuratively in the markets.

But let's have a realistic discussion. 

For New Space to take off, especially a Launch company, it needs customers. And right now all of RKLBs publicly traded customers are in the toilet.

I think we're entering a phase of the campaign similar to Kursk or US Civil War's siege of Petersburg. Just some long drawn out slog.

The three leading orbital companies that have great growth prospects that are currently passed merger are RDW, BKSY and SPIR.

BKSY competes with Planet for real time imagery, but Planet isn't post merger yet and BKSY hasn't filed for S1 uet

Both RDW and SPIR are past EFFECT.

All, together with RKLB are down for some common reasons and some uncommon.

I think New Space is beaten up by drying liquidity as oil sucks up money for margin calls. Whoever messed up the energy markets messed it up big. 

The debt ceiling wasn't helping any but that's that's pushed off to December.

And China is literally imploding around our ears and it's hard to tell if it'll just implode or if it will drag capital into the quagmire as it sinks under apparently crushing debt.

So. Naturally experimental new companies aren't going to get the Lion's share of attention.

Then, RKLB normally a stronger leader is weak, I believe, until EFFECT.

After that is the nature of the thread.

If the market deems RKLBs customers (BKSY) and potential customers (RDW and SPIR) as weak...does that mean the market will also deem RKLB weak and we have to adjust our entry targets even lower? 

My goal was to enter as soon as EFFECT goes into effect.

But, now I think marker forces will drive weakness a little longer.

I'm waiting to see some strength return to those 3 stocks to reevaluate my strategy.

In the mean time all we can do is wait. I see some potential strength returning to BKSY but it is the worst proxy because it hasn't even filed its S1 yet.

RKLB_posts.csv,RKLB Short Term Bear Thesis (Long Term Bull),"The intention of this post is to outline why I consider RKLB to be an outstanding company with an overvalued stock price. I‚Äôve been lurking on this sub for quite some time, and I frequently see people making bold price projections for RKLB‚Äôs future stock price with little to no substance backing up their estimates. That being said, I would like to provide a detailed breakdown for why I believe RKLB‚Äôs fair value is approximately $6 per share right now. This is a short term (1 year or less) projection, not a long term projection. I look forward to hearing your feedback and seeing where we differ in opinion.

*Let‚Äôs start with the good stuff. This encapsulates basically everything but the stock price.*

**Strong Leadership**
Peter Beck is exactly the right person to be running this company. He has the perfect blend of intelligence, charisma, and modesty to make the company as successful as it has been. The track record of successful launches that RKLB has achieved is a tremendous achievement for someone that, unlike his main competitors (Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, Elon Musk), does not have more money than god. I also see no concerning loss of senior talent, and I've seen an ability to attract new talent in recent months. Quality leadership is the most important thing I look for in an investment, and RKLB appears to have that in spades.

**Successful Track Record**
As mentioned earlier, the track record RKLB has achieved with Electron has been spectacular. 53 launches with minimal failures speaks volumes about the quality of the engineering talent at RKLB. Unlike many other people that have a negative take on RKLB, I actually don‚Äôt think that Neutron will struggle to reach a successful track record of launches and profitability. The recent hot fire test of the Archimedes engine was impressive, and it appears RKLB is on track to meet their goals with Neutron.

**Positive Catalysts**
There are several catalysts which I believe could completely annihilate my expectations for RKLB‚Äôs stock to decline in the near to mid term. First, an overall increased interest in the space industry from the market as a whole. Markets are always looking for the next hot thing, and it‚Äôs entirely possible space could be that. Just like artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, SPACs, etc., the space industry at large could see a significant uptick in investor interest. This could lead to an increase in RKLB‚Äôs multiple and stock price without necessitating an increase in revenue or profitability. Secondly and tangentially, an IPO of SpaceX could greatly increase RKLB‚Äôs visibility in the market. I believe a SpaceX IPO would cause a rising tide that raises all ships in the space industry, and RKLB would benefit. Lastly, I believe RKLB has a substantial amount of ‚Äúmeme stock‚Äù potential. The company‚Äôs name has been spreading within the forums of people that invest in meme stocks, and it‚Äôs possible RKLB could be the next big one as many of those speculators lose faith in GME, AMC, etc.

*Now let‚Äôs talk about the negatives.*

**Revenue/Profitability**
I believe it is fairly easy to project out RKLB‚Äôs likely profitability over the next 1-3 years, and I don‚Äôt expect to see many positive surprises on either top line revenue or bottom line earnings. Revenue is rising, but predictably, and I don‚Äôt see any significant catalysts for revenue to surprise on the upside. The revenue isn‚Äôt explicitly a negative as revenue growth has been strong, but the stock price relative to revenue is beginning to become unsustainable. 

RKLB became public in 2021 through a SPAC so we can‚Äôt too far back with their financials. In 2020 with seven Electron launches, RKLB had $35MM in revenue or about $6MM per launch.  In 2021 with six launches, RKLB had about $62MM in revenue or about $10MM per launch. In 2022 with nine launches, RKLB had $211MM in revenue or about $23MM per launch. In 2023 with nine launches, RKLB had about $244MM in revenue or about $27MM per launch. For the last 12 months (June 2023-June 2024) across twelve launches, RKLB had about $326MM in revenue or about $27MM per launch. These numbers show strong growth in launch count, total revenue, and revenue per launch. As we all know, most of RKLB‚Äôs revenue is outside of launch services, but their ability to launch successfully is critical for their future ability to generate revenue and profitability across all their business lines. For the first half of 2024, RKLB had about $200MM in revenue and they are projecting about $100MM in the third quarter. For the full year, I am assuming they settle in around $400MM in revenue for the year. Very solid revenue growth compared to 2023.

That‚Äôs all positive, but the stock price as compared to that revenue is overheated, from my perspective. Based on most recent valuations, it appears the market leader in RKLB‚Äôs industry is currently valued at about 23x 2023 revenue or 15x projected 2024 revenue. Obviously, SpaceX is a private company that is valued differently than in the public markets, but this multiple seems reasonable for the industry‚Äôs profit margins and growth expectations. I‚Äôm aware that RKLB‚Äôs business lines aren‚Äôt identical to SpaceX‚Äôs, but I believe Wall Street will utilize similar logic when establishing an appropriate multiple for RKLB. However, given SpaceX‚Äôs dominance in the industry and the significant amount of execution risk remaining in RKLB‚Äôs growth trajectory, it would be appropriate to apply a lower multiple to RKLB to account for this risk. At a stock price of $10 or a market cap of about $4.9BB, RKLB is trading at a 20x multiple on 2023 revenue or 12x expected 2024 revenue. From my perspective, this is not a large enough discount compared to SpaceX. I believe that RKLB‚Äôs multiple should be no more than half of SpaceX‚Äôs - 11.5x 2023 revenue or 7.5x projected 2024 revenue. This would equate to a market capitalization of $2.8BB to $3.0BB. This range of market capitalizations would equate to a stock price of $5.50 to $6.00 per share.

**Psychological $10 Barrier**
As previously mentioned, RKLB IPO‚Äôed through a SPAC merger back in 2021 at about $10 per share. After experiencing a large but short-lived pump in the share price, the stock quickly dove down to the $4-$5 range where it stayed for years. Investors that entered a RKLB position at IPO or in the immediate run-up post-IPO are finally seeing an opportunity to exit the shares of a company that has done nothing for them for years as the S&P, Dow and Nasdaq have hit record highs. That being said, I think $10 will be a very difficult barrier to break both for practical and psychological reasons. The vast majority of companies that IPO‚Äôed via a SPAC are still trading below their IPO price today. Increases in the share price above $10 are likely to be short-lived as we saw on September 30th, the first trading day after public confirmation of the successful hot fire tests of the Archimedes engine. 

**Conclusion**
In summation, I believe RKLB‚Äôs share price is experiencing a short term pump above what I‚Äôd consider to be a sustainable market capitalization based on their current and future revenue expectations. I expect the shares to return to $6 range before year end. I do not expect the shares to return to the $4 range. In the spirit of disclosure, I should mention that I previously worked for a private equity company that still holds a substantial stake in RKLB and SpaceX, but I was not directly involved in the private equity arm of the company so I had no special access to their investment theses or MNPI. I do still own approximately $50,000 in equity shares of my previous company. As it relates to more direct RKLB-related investments, I have a number of November 2024 put options with a $7 strike price that I paid approximately $.20 per share for. In the event my investment thesis plays out as I expect, I intend to convert the profits from the put options into an equity stake in RKLB with a holding period of 5+ years.

RKLB_posts.csv,"Out of Gilmour Space Technologies and Dawn Aerospace, which of the two poses the strongest competition to Rocket Lab?","Hello everyone,

I am just wondering, out of the various competitors to Rocket Lab, two notable firms are based in Australia and New Zealand respectively (noting that most Rocket Lab launches happen from New Zealand and a decent portion of Rocket Lab's workforce is still in New Zealand).

The first of these companies intends to launch a hybrid rocket called Eris from the Bowen orbital spaceport in a month or two from now. However, they have faced issues in the past with significant delays from a planned 2022 launch date. Additionally, the only flight test of their hybrid technology, using a scaled down suborbital rocket called One Vision, [failed in 2019](https://www.gspace.com/post/one-vision-statement). Others have commented on the general deficiencies of their hybrid technology in comparison with more mature solid or liquid systems. Also of note, the recent signing of a Technology Safeguards Agreement between Australia and the US has made the firm concerned about overseas competition in Australia.

The second of these is a company spread across New Zealand, the Netherlands, and the United States with the end goal of building a spaceplane. While they have not yet gotten a space plane to work, they have been able to build a scale prototype. Also interestingly, Dawn Aerospace has also successfully [built cubesat thrusters](https://www.dawnaerospace.com/latest-news/b20-thrusters-proven-in-space).

RKLB_posts.csv,I think a short cover has begun.,"We'll really see tomorrow - and I mean a broad indexed recovery.

Basically economic news is still good.

Soooo...if tomorrow's strong, I think it'll rally through Friday as a Short Cover.

And if Monday continues the rally - it's likely it'll persist through to the end of the year.

RKLB_posts.csv,RKLB is worth ~11.70 but Institutional Buyers are in near ~15.,"OK - my previous work was deleted by the Rocket Lab subreddit, I didn't know about this place when I first posted. But I'll just give you my answers rather than show you my work.

A stock never trades for what it's worth, it trades at a premium.

* RKLB is about $11.70/share - I calculated this based on money inflows.
* RKLB institutional buyers cost basis is about $15/share. This matters because that is the most likely support level. It would be difficult for RKLB to trade below 15/share.
* RKLB is an automatic sell above $18.50 - Institutional buyers over-buy shares to sell shares at higher prices to lower the cost basis for their targets.

Example: You want to own 1,000 shares. The stock is trading at a premium. You estimate an expected move of $5 (this was true for RKLB on Wednesday when I created my winning position at an adjusted cost basis of $11.71). You buy 2,000 shares at an average price of $17. You sell 1,000 shares at an average price of $19. You hit your target of 1,000 shares at a cost basis of $15. (ROUGHLY).

To do this, institutions sold anything above $18.50. More specifically they sold on Thursday at anything above $20. But a second round of selling was at $19.50.

On Friday the sell mark was about $18.50 on very low volume. So either the institutions finished their positioning or they had a few positions to finish and took it around there.

**WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN FOR YOU?**

It means:

* ***Buy around 15*** (today is testing that target. I think I will wait till tomorrow for some market bleeding to finish, and then confirm my next target. I think I'm aiming for a price of $16 and an adjusted cost basis of about...$12.50 or $13 while expanding my position by 6.25%. If anyone cares what I'm planning).
* ***Sell around $20 - maybe $18.50*** \- I think demand is around there. Institutions want to keep their cost basis down and they'll bleed off shares around there for NOW. That won't always be the case. But until next earnings that's what's going to likely happen.
* If you're long on RKLB and don't care about lowering cost basis further....you can ignore the sell (demand) pools. The buy (support) pools are more important to you.
* Since stocks trade at premiums, you probably can't hit $15. I'd be highly surprised if it does. But if it does I'd expand my position by the difference. So if it hits 14 then I'll expand my position by an additional 6.7%.

Lastly - why is RKLB down?

1. Because institutional buyers are at 15 and don't need to see gains yet, so they sell to lower cost basis and aren't opening positions.
2. Market at large is  depressed and may be for the rest of the week. But I'm generally bullish on the market at large, I think the bleed off last week was perfect.
3. Sep - Oct look like sideways months, so not much activity will happen over next few weeks.",16,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/pnk06d/rklb_is_worth_1170_but_institutional_buyers_are/,0.9905,0.137,0.804,0.06

RKLB_posts.csv,To the Ones Sleeping on RKLB,"A few months ago I stumbled upon RKLB and it was hella low‚Ä¶ but I never pulled the trigger. As of late it‚Äôs been moving and so naturally i‚Äôve been looking into it more and more and wanted to get a feel for how it stacks up against the competition (This is just for people who are relatively new‚Ä¶ very obvious info). Rocket Lab is up against companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and some smaller guys like Astra and Firefly Aerospace.
 
Obviously Musk is the big dawg of the commercial space sector, with a $210 billion valuation. They dominate the industry with cheap rideshare missions for small satellites, which is bad news for Rocket Lab since they‚Äôre targeting the same market. Pretty much‚Ä¶. SpaceX‚Äôs scale and success are the biggest threats to Rocket Lab, hands down‚Ä¶. especially with the funding they just pulled too.

Blue Origin, while worth around $12 billion because they have Bezos running the show, the company is absolute dogwater for now and 0 threat. They are yet to surpass a suborbital launch lmao.

Now, Astra and Firefly are smaller but focused on launching small satellites at low costs. They‚Äôre not doing as many launches as Rocket Lab, but they could be disruptive by offering cheaper alternatives in the future but for now it's nothing crazy.

One company in this whole commercial space industry that kinda made me pause was Virgins Orbit. To really understand Rocket Lab‚Äôs position, I started looking into Virgin Orbit‚Äôs story. Basically for some background, they were another promising company in the small satellite market, valued at around $200 million before going bankrupt in 2023. This got me thinking though‚Ä¶ was Virgin Orbit ever worth more? Turns out, at its peak, Virgin Orbit was valued at around $3.7 billion because of the hype around their air-launch system.

That‚Äôs when I started to feel a little nervous. If Virgin Orbit, a company once worth billions, could go bankrupt, what about Rocket Lab? With a current valuation of $5.5 billion, it‚Äôs not that far off. Given how tough the space industry is (super high costs, tons of competition, substantial loss when things go bad, etc), it‚Äôs a fair question to ask if Rocket Lab could face a similar fate.

After digging deeper (GPT search is goated for this), I found some key reasons Rocket Lab is way more robust and unlikely to follow in Virgin Orbit‚Äôs footsteps:

* Unlike Virgin Orbit, which struggled with consistent operations and reliability, Rocket Lab has a proven record of successful launches. As of now, Rocket Lab has completed dozens of successful Electron launches, building customer confidence and expanding its market share. Looking at Virgin Orbit‚Ä¶. Basically they had only completed a handful of launches and faced way more technical issues. Rocket Lab's reliability in delivering payloads on time and at a competitive cost is a significant advantage over the difficulties Virgin Orbit experienced.  
* Rocket Lab is not solely dependent on launch services. It has successfully diversified into spacecraft design, satellite components, and satellite management services, which provide additional revenue streams. This strategic diversification helps mitigate the risks associated with relying solely on launch operations, which was one of Virgin Orbit‚Äôs weaknesses. Virgin Orbit primarily focused on air launch technology.  
* Rocket Lab has future projects like the development of the Neutron rocket, which will allow it to compete in the medium-lift launch market, giving it access to larger payloads and way more lucrative contracts. At this point‚Ä¶ Virgin Orbit was still trying to establish itself in the smaller payload market when it encountered financial troubles (so they weren't even able to get past logistics). . Additionally, Rocket Lab has been working on reusability with Electron, which could further reduce costs and increase profitability over time, a significant factor that Virgin Orbit lacked.  
* Rocket Lab has raised significant capital and managed its finances well, with plans to grow its business strategically. Virgin Orbit, despite its initial $3.7 billion valuation, faced liquidity issues and struggled to raise funds, eventually leading to bankruptcy. Rocket Lab‚Äôs revenue has been growing steadily, and while it is not yet profitable, the company's long-term plans for increasing revenue through more launches, satellite services, and new rocket developments give it a clearer path to profitability than Virgin Orbit ever had.  
* The demand for small and medium satellite launches is growing due to the rise of satellite constellations for communications, earth observation, and defence. Rocket Lab is well positioned to capitalise on this, having established itself as a trusted provider. Virgin Orbit‚Äôs limited ability to scale and capture a significant portion of this growing market played a role in its downfall.

So yeah, while I had some initial concerns comparing Rocket Lab to Virgin Orbit‚Äôs downfall, it‚Äôs clear that Rocket Lab is in a much stronger spot

RKLB_posts.csv,Why you have PIPE all wrong,"Anyone who has listened to me knows 2 things.

1) I learn from others but am a vociferous ahole.

2) I'm very bullish about RKLB.

But let me curb your enthusiasm with some realism.

RKLBs float is about to increase by 2x. More like 115% actually.

I know everyone thinks that means that you just buy more shares and the stock will go up.

Let me put it in perspective. 

How ever many shares you COULD BUY at $15 now. 

Multiple it by 115%.

That's how many MORE SHARES you need to buy just to keep the price the same.

So ask yourself.

If you are unable to buy 2x the shares at $15.

The price won't stay at $15. It must come down.

If you could use 100% of your capital to buy RKLB at $15 then the price must fall to $7.50 to meet the new supply demand curve.

I'm definitely not saying RKLB will depreciate by 55%.

But I'm saying for those of us who are long RKLB. Be ready for an uphill battle.

RKLB_posts.csv,Not astrology! Promise!!!  Just sharing what I have been watching on the latest uptrend‚Ä¶,"Not an astrologer.

(Post is) Not really a conversation starter or anything too noteworthy, but sharing because it does display strength and accumulation. 

Nfa though. I‚Äôm sharing something that reinforces my thesis. Rocket Lab will be 100$ a share and it won‚Äôt be a pump and dump (long time from now, but it‚Äôs happening).

This is how I know.

Connecting the chart / daily price action, and the accumulation that has happened on this uptrend... 

When share price has dipped to the low end of a range (chart flattens out for a week or so), I have noticed large scale orders spike (not retail buys, massive buys). Noticed the same thing when the candles trade sideways on each step of the staircase on this last rise. The large orders hit the tape on the lower end of the price range. Then, share price takes the next step up.

Like I said, nothing noteworthy. What it displays though can give you, us dumb money retail investors, a little more confidence in holding your shares. You selling isn‚Äôt going to really do anything to the price, not trying to sell you on my thesis‚Ä¶. but maybe it will help you not bail on an opportunity to change your financial situation without doing anything‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt get scared out of your position. 

The spikes on the price cost distribution chart display consolidation / institutional buying in at the low end of the trading range / building positions. 

To connect the images simply‚Ä¶

First image displays the daily chart, each candle is 1 day. The sideways price action is accumulation and is directly correlated to the spikes on the ‚Äúcost distribution chart in second image. Then the last image displays the order flow for today. Notice the large scale orders. That is not retail investors. That is institutional buying and they hold their shares for a very long time. This allows share price to keep going up. Gradually, and not without dips.

Blackrock owned 4.9% of the company (just under disclosure requirements / 13 g). They bought another 1.1% of the company (disclosed last week, think they have 15 -30 days to file the 13). Yes they own everything, but a ~6% position is not to be ignored.

More institutions will follow. Current institutional ownership is just over 57%. Has increased steadily since the decrease in inst ownership when Kholsa distributed shares / lock-up ended. That was when price was ~ 4.50. 

If something negative happens (news / launch failure) look at the spike on the price cost distribution chart below the one we are at now. That is what stock astrologers call support levels. Buy more then. Usually takes another negative event to break that one.

This is the easiest money I have ever made. I‚Äôm just a science teacher. Money for nothing is welcomed. 

You do you, but hope you make money. There is plenty to go around. Would hate to see institutions make that money instead of you all reading Reddit posts on a Thursday night.

RKLB_posts.csv,Update on my technical analysis from last week.,"So I mentioned last week that RKLB was testing its 20MA and that the hammer was a good indicator, but we needed a confirmation candle. Well today, barring any drastic changes, we have tha confirmation.

RKLB price gapped-up, largely to follow the 20MA, and so there is a bullish trend forming.

That being said, that trend can be impacted by headwinds from any market headwinds such as a Federal Government Shut Down. That usually doesn't impact the trend and is what oscillators are for. You buy the dip when the headwind causes price to fall in an up trend.

You short the break-out when a tailwind causes prices to rise in a down trend.

That's oscillation.

In this case, I'd say RKLB finally has formed its first, new, uptrend and probably someone with big purchasing power is just following the 20MA since there's such close correlation.

Also, this gap up is forming on increasing volume, very healthy sign.

While I do not care when profitability does occur, Rocket Lab has inarguably just become a different ‚Äúanimal‚Äù so to speak. 

While I have known that the pursuit of neutron has been the barrier to profitability, not everyone does.

Beck / Rocket Lab could be a viable candidate to beat Musk / spaceX‚Äôs starship to functionality with Neutron. A lofty and worthwhile goal. I believe Rocket Lab will at worst be a close second to deliver an interplanetary human carrying vehicle.

Regardless of all of that‚Ä¶ 

Rocket Lab is no longer worried about cash. That clears up any worry I had. 

When I have free cash, enough to buy 272 shares. I will buy to get to 4k shares. Believe we are no longer a penny stock (under 5$). If wrong, I will consider myself lucky.

Looking at the valuation of RKLB's peers in the startup space sector (ASTS, Blacksky, Redwire) it is already very richly valued in comparison. Furthermore in comparison to established Aerospace & Defense sector stocks like Embraer, Maxar, AAR, and SPCE it seems like $2B market cap is just about inline with them already even with its limited (though very successful) launch schedule.

RKLB_posts.csv,Should I re-invest now?,"Hello!

I love Rocket Lab, and since I work in the space industry I feel like I can understand better what is going on with the company and therefore invest better.

However, I am starting to invest, I have a diversified portfolio with some bigs and some startups, tech, biotech and engineering, so I don‚Äôt want to put all my eggs to Rocket Lab. On top of that, RocketLab is a very weird stock in terms of market response.

So, I have an average of 4.90, and I lost the opportunity to invest when it was around 4 because I did not have the money (I had plenty other operations ongoing to transfer from one trader to another so I needed money)

In any case my question is: should I re-invest now? Should I wait for the hype after the 55M$ news to go down?

I know that in the longterm even 1$ difference won‚Äôt change much, but with low money on my hands my only chances at growing the portfolio is timing well and shorting.

RKLB_posts.csv,RKLB back to $15.50! What's going on?,"Someone pointed out PLTR had a similar thing yesterday. So when I investigated I think this makes more sense.

I have had a hunch that market makers are trying to lock short-options sellers into their trades, specifically put sellers who will be left holding the bag for the market makers when they convert a lot of shares.

To do that they are keeping premiums higher than they normally would be.

It made sense to me that they could push the price down for only so long because this is like pushing down a buoy.

So when the price can no longer be pushed down, what to do? Spike it real high, then crash it. And here's why.

As you can see with PLTR - the implied volatility went through the roof. Which there's two ways to keep short-option high priced (Lock a short-option trader into their trade), move the price against the option, or raise the volatility.

**HOW TO CONFIRM THIS?**

Tomorrow, if $14 Puts stay above $1.35 (right now it's $1.75) then I'd say this confirms the reason of the action.

**Where's the battle being fought?**

The battle between us and the market makers is being fought over who holds the bag when SEC pulls the EFFECTIVE trigger. For instance - I closed out my short-puts for a profit. But if I waited too long (until today) I would have been near a loss. Even at $1.75 I'm at a profit still, technically, just not much of one.

So the battle is being fought over who stays trapped into these trades so when the market makers need to, they exercise their long-puts on the short-putters.  


This is only part of what I think is going on, there's also a battle over $10 calls and a few other strikes. Etc.

But - I think the price action is suggesting that as time is running out on the Oct 15s, that the Market Makers are running out of what they can do to control the premiums of the options.

Eventually an option is either in the money or out of the money and is either worth something or worth nothing. And the Market Makers are fighting over keeping premiums high enough to lock in trades while the value of the premiums are quickly evaporating due to time running out.

RKLB_posts.csv,RKLB - Finally Taking off?,"I think this is it. Take off. $12.30 has proven a buy wall, but more importantly we have two very key indicators we finally hit a bottom and it's ripe for reversal.

1. Technical - a ""doji"" which suggests a lot of money on the sidelines ready to pile in to which ever side wins. And since we're pretty down and every short gets bought-up above $12.30 I think it's safe to say which side will win.
2. Structural - Options premiums are increasing in price. This is usually up to the market maker and they do it to put a lid on expected upward moves. It's partly mechanical as they try to remain neutral, and its partly opportunistic as they want to harvest demand. TL;DR, increasing premium price means increasing demand for the stock.

RKLB_posts.csv,Opinion - Re NZ Level 3 lockdown and potential launch date,"Just wanted to share a little perspective from a New Zealander.

Auckland has just returned to Level 3. This means that if you are able to, you are required to work from home. This is not an advisory, but a requirement. The rest of the country is at level 2, which means you can return to work, but there are significant restrictions in place regarding social distancing etc. 

Considering that NZ went to Level 4, complete lockdown when a SINGLE case of the Delta variant appeared, there are many people surprised that we are returning to level 3 when we are still seeing around 20 new cases a day. There are still a few surprise cases that they can't track the source, so this is by no means the last time we'll be seeing further spikes.

Auckland will remain in level 3 for at least two weeks, and quite possibly longer when you consider the number of new cases. 

How will this effect Rocket Lab and it's launch schedule? Well, although their launch site is at level 2, their Auckland facility is at level 3. I think this will have a significant effect on their ability to launch.

As at today, their next mission ""Love at first Insight"" is due to launch October 31 at 1pm. I don't think it's going to be before this date, and may well be delayed further. People are speculating that there might be a launch in the next couple of weeks, but I just can't see it.

RKLB_posts.csv,Was the Neutron reveal update one of the reasons for the massive pullback in Rocket Lab?,"https://youtu.be/7kwAPr5G6WA

So I am seeing a lot of hiring for Rocket Lab and in regards to the Neutron rocket.  But how far along are they?  Did they just start developing this ?  Reason I ask is I remember seeing interviews with Peter Beck saying that one of the reasons they merged with Vector Acquisitions was to get the financing for the Neutron.  So obviously they at least had a plan in 2019-2020 for the Neutron.  But actual development?  Seems like only started in 2021.  

If you look at their financial projections, they give clear guidance on how much revenue per year in the future for launch services.  Well no way they can do over $900 million per year just on electron that charging $7 million per electron launch.

RKLB_posts.csv,Glassdoor reviews & vacancies analysis,"(let me know if this post is not appropriate!)

# Why analyze glassdoor reviews?

Hello there, lovely people of RKLB! As this subreddit and the general interest in Rocket Lab seems to grow quite rapidly, I decided to have a look at some public information about glassdoor reviews & vacancies and share them with you. This gives me good practice scraping the data and formatting it into something digestible.

I believe that for the company to succeed, it needs talented and motivated employees. One way to gain insight into what employees think of their company is by looking at glassdoor reviews. Glassdoor is a website that allows users to (anonymously) rate their company and share their salary (ranges), giving outsiders insight into what happens inside the company.

# How trustworthy is glassdoor information?

Glassdoor reviews can be made anonymous and there is not much transparency about how many reviews on the website are made by nefarious actors (e.g. bots). About the user verification process, glassdoor mentions this:

> At Glassdoor, we aim to verify as much of our data as possible. Considering the reality of our digital age, however, we're unable to fully confirm our users' identities, the truthfulness of their contributions, or their employment status. 

There is therefore no guarantee that the reviews are all trustworthy. Regarding the vacancies, I was unable to check whether all of them are still open or if new ones are open that are not mentioned on the website. Therefore, take this disclaimer and don't see this information as a hard truth.

# Given information on Rocket Lab from glassdoor's website.

Glassdoor shows 125 Rocket Lab reviews on its website, with an average rating of 3.2 stars.  I have created a table with some ""*competitors*"" (I know, some of them don't belong but I included them for reference), showing that the total rating of Rocket Lab is on the low end of these companies.

|Company|Rating|Number of reviews|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rocket Lab|3.2|125|
|SpaceX|4.0|2.800|
|ULA|3.7|514|
|Relativity Space|3.7|112|
|ABL Space Systems|2.9|26|
|Astra|3.2|35|
|Virgin Orbit|3.7|131|

Overall, Rocket Lab scores the lowest in work/life balance, which is a recurring theme in the written reviews where people complain about not being able to work from home, bad management and a high employee retention rate.

[Rocket Lab's average rating for different aspects of the company](https://preview.redd.it/yz34ahuajn4b1.png?width=1486&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddea0378c38e457d591afe4d7824cc1fb4af7834)

# Does the rating differ per location?

One of the main questions I wanted to answer was whether some locations stood out in the rating, or whether the rating is uniform over the company.  A large group of reviews did not specify a location, but fortunately, the majority did. You can see the results in the table below.

|Location|Rating|Number of reviews|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Unspecified|3.33|49|
|Auckland, Auckland|3.20|45|
|Long Beach, CA|2.75|12|
|Huntington Beach, CA|3.5|2|
|Mount Wellington, Auckland|2|2|
|Silver Spring, MD|4|1|
|London, England|5|1|
|Wayne, NJ|1|1|

Though there are differences in rating between locations, it seems that there are too few reviews to draw conclusions about big differences between locations.

# How about vacancies?

There are a total of 200 ( though the overview on the glassdoor website shows varying amounts). I was interested to see how these were divided over the different locations and gathered the following results (some locations were disregarded due to low 

&#x200B;

|Location|Number of vacancies|
|:-|:-|
|Long Beach, CA|101|
|Albuquerque, NM|50|
|Silver Spring, MD|16|
|Wallops Island, VA|13|
|Littleton, CO|10|
|Mississippi State, MS|4|

As everyone would expect, the majority of the vacancies are currently in Long Beach.

RKLB_posts.csv,RKLB MSR odds increased due to Elon‚Äôs recent actions. ,"I firmly believe that all of Elons recent shenanigans (getting very political very quickly, paying for votes, claims he‚Äôs talking to Putin, etc.) are only going to help RKLB. NASA administrator Nelson believes that these claims about Elon should be investigated and I believe there‚Äôs a growing anti-monopoly mindset around SpaceX right now in this industry. 

Therefore, I think that NASA is more likely to choose RKLB over SpaceX for MSR due to wanting to help get other launch providers up to a near-SpaceX level quicker. 

But they won‚Äôt just do this out of kindness, I also cannot see any other realistic candidate with RKLBs interplanetary track record. The only other real competitor (other than SpaceX) is BO and they just don‚Äôt have the resume for this. Unless their application was joint with many other organizations, I just don‚Äôt see them getting MSR.

We are coming off a consolidation phase and a gap up occurred today. From a technicals point of view,

1. There was a shooting star candlestick pattern on 10/24. Stock dipped by about 15% from a high of 12.09 to a low $10.16 on 10/31.  After this it crossed $13.
2. No major catalysts during this period. 
3. MACD's are crossing over and turning positive

The setup is incredible going into the earnings. I love this uptrend and I am betting that SPB has some great news to share on the earnings call. IMO, There are people seeing ""A secular trend"" and that's the driver for this momentum.  I mentioned this in my previous post. Other than that, I have no inside information.

PS: To newbie options players. This is not the best time to sell CC's. Option buyers, the premiums are just too high. Nov15 $17 1254 contracts were traded for $0.12. That's ridiculous. Don't throw away your money. **Sometimes, you miss the boat. Accept it. Don't chase it. Buy shares instead.**

RKLB_posts.csv,Is this time different? (Dramatic positive price action followed by sell off),"I have watched profit bleed away several times on this stock. Over 25k on separate moves IF I sold and bought back (below my current 4.62 average). 

I haven‚Äôt sold and have simply kept adding. Up to 4475 shares now.

Seeing profit drift away is obv lame.

I haven‚Äôt sold because I was looking for a special company. I think I found it in rocket lab. 

I am tempted to sell now as I‚Äôm sure so many of us are. 

I‚Äôm not selling because Rocket Lab will be worth 20bil eventually. I have no doubt. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going straight there now, but someday far in the future 40$ shares is fully reasonable (if the company realizes ambitions).

I have read absolutely everything there is to know about the company and people (many of the board members, especially like Beck as a person and Spice is also nice- he was CFO for Qualcomm (I believe, please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but he does have experience in the semi / chips industry and space chips (even if only for solar cells (which I don‚Äôt think they are). I think they are making and developing chips for satellite operation / control and other various space craft in future))

Regardless of the semis / chips, the other aspects of the company are all notably exceptional. There are 4 ish various space craft at the moment (see video where Beck introduces the new names, it is funny) 

YouTube search ‚ÄúRocket Lab Spacecraft Family‚Äù link: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AxEMnB9m-uw

 They have small launch fairly nailed, but more valuable and fully overlooked / not priced in is the ‚Äúspace systems‚Äù sector. Space companies that operate just satellites (like Iridium and ASTS) have market caps that dwarf Rocket Lab. Rocket Lab does what they do too‚Ä¶ 

A little personal background‚Ä¶
Rocket Lab is 5% of my investment $ (in addition to a teacher‚Äôs pension). I have 215k in a tax deferred annuity that collects 7% fixed return. 24% of my pay goes directly into the annuity. RKLB is a 20k$ investment with money iI don‚Äôt spend every couple weeks. RKLB is very high risk I am not looking with rose colored glasses. There are many risks (Not worried about losing it all because I have the fixed return account‚Ä¶

Anyway, i can‚Äôt pull myself to sell this time or after any rise in share price (will sell 1000 shares at 28.50.  now, I could take 11k profit‚Ä¶. That just isn‚Äôt why I‚Äôm here. 

Say less, I know.

How it's not worth $5B today because it doesn't have the revenues to support that valuation. These posters are missing the point. You, I, analysts, pundits, space enthusiasts, or market experts don't decide what a stock is worth. Only the market decides what stocks are ""worth"". And currently it's saying that RKLB is worth 5B today not because of what it's actually intrinsically worth, but because that the chance of it being worth 25, 50, 100B+ in a few years is becoming more and more likely.

A lottery ticket is a piece of paper worth nothing intrinsically. You don't buy it for the value of the paper. You buy it because it comes with the opportunity for it to later actually be worth a large amount of money.

It's fine if you want to trade RKLB and try and call the tops and bottoms. Honestly I do that with about 5% of my position, it keeps me engaged with the stock price and I don't feel like I'm missing out on taking some profits. But I'm holding 95% of my position long term, because I know this stock will eventually start running and not slow down.

RKLB_posts.csv,Just beginning to think we have a couple years before we see massive gains‚Ä¶,"Someone posted a comment on another post I made and it is sticking in my head.

The comment brought up that Kholsa wouldn‚Äôt exit their massive position unless they saw a better opportunity; an investment that would make them more money faster‚Ä¶.

I am thinking that is exactly the case. I have watched google increase from 110 a share, when I bought in, to 160-170 a share and I expect it to go even higher. Bought into Microsoft with a solid position at 225$ a share. Apple shares with an average of 110$ a share and amazon at 115$ a share.

I sold everything and put it with Rocketlab because I thought we would see 100% gains sooner than later. 

Obviously not very wise in hindsight as I would have well over 30% gains.

I am just recognizing that there are better opportunities in the near term. There are many and obvious.

Would I change what I did? Obviously. Am I bothered? Absolutely not.

Not bothered because I will not miss this opportunity. There will be a day when we leave penny stock land forever. That day could be any day, but it could also be a couple years. 

It‚Äôs looking like years is likely if the macro market stays risk adverse, but that can change in a second. 

The market is what it is and is waiting on RKLB and that is annoying, but fully understandable. 

Turning a profit on paper is the real catalyst for a sustained increase in share price. Neutron launch in 2025 is another, but that is a gigantic accomplishment and an equally huge catalyst.

All of this said, I am going to be patient. I will keep buying while we sit at mid to low 4$ a share. 

If I was looking for 50% gains near term, I would have stayed in the Mag 7. I want 5x and do not see that as a pipe dream with Rocket Lab. It may take 10 years, but I am here ready to wait.

Now that we're nearly halfway through Q1 24, I'd have thought that more than just one of the 5 stages for 2023 would have turned from yellow to green by now. Never mind all the other stages in 2024, which haven't even turned yellow yet. If this is a true reflection of the timescale by Rocket Lab on their Neutron Path to Lift-off, it's certainly not looking very positive for it to be on the launch pad in a complete, ready to launch state. I'm afraid just placing a bunch of various Neutron bits and pieces on a concrete pad will not suffice. I think this latest $300m cash raise was done as they realise that extra time and additional resources are required to complete Neutron/Archimedes, and I'm afraid news of this may just be around the corner.",33,34,https://www.rocketlabusa.com/launch/neutron/,0.3938,0.051,0.915,0.033
RKLB_posts.csv,Space operations and management constellation?,"With the imminent retirement of the NASA ""Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System"" (TDRS), I have been wondering if some sort of space operations and management constellation might be a good candidate for Rocket Lab's first space services constellation?

First some background courtesy of Chat GPT:

**What is the TDRS?**

The *Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System* (TDRS) is NASA's communication network used to support real-time data and command transmission between Earth and spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO), such as the International Space Station and the Hubble Space Telescope. Operating since 1983, TDRS consists of multiple geostationary satellites and ground stations, providing near-continuous coverage.

The system facilitates telemetry, tracking, and data transfer, enabling critical operations for various NASA missions. NASA is transitioning to commercial services as TDRS ages.

**What is the CSP?**

The *Communication Services Project* (CSP) is a NASA initiative aimed at transitioning from government-owned satellite communication systems, such as the TDRS, to commercially operated services. The CSP involves partnerships with private companies to develop and demonstrate advanced communication capabilities for space missions. These capabilities include satellite relay, ground-to-space communications, and data transmission, ensuring reliable and cost-effective support for NASA's future needs. The project is a cornerstone of NASA's strategy to leverage private-sector innovation for space infrastructure.

**What is SSA?**

*Space Situational Awareness* (SSA) refers to the ability to track and understand the behavior of objects in space, including active satellites, debris, and other spacecraft. SSA involves monitoring their positions, predicting potential collisions, and assessing risks to space operations. It is crucial for satellite operators, governments, and military organizations to ensure safe and sustainable use of Earth's orbits, particularly as space becomes increasingly crowded with new satellites and debris. SSA data is gathered using ground-based and space-based sensors, radar, and optical systems.

**What is a SON?**

*Satellite Operations Network* (SON) refers to the integrated system of ground stations, communication links, and software infrastructure used to manage, monitor, and control a satellite or a constellation of satellites. The SON ensures the execution of mission commands, monitors telemetry data, and facilitates two-way communication between satellites and operators. Advanced SONs often include automation, real-time data analysis, and tools for handling large-scale constellations with minimal human intervention.

**What is STM?**

*Space Traffic Management* (STM) refers to the planning, coordination, and execution of operations to ensure the safe and sustainable use of Earth‚Äôs orbital environment. It encompasses tracking space objects (satellites, debris), avoiding collisions, managing orbital slots, and coordinating launches. STM combines policy frameworks, technical systems (like SSA), and international cooperation to mitigate risks from space congestion and orbital debris, ensuring efficient and safe space operations for both public and private entities.

**What would you call a combined SSA, SON and STM system?**

A combined system integrating *Space Situational Awareness* (SSA), *Satellite Operations Network* (SON), and *Space Traffic Management* (STM) could be called an *Integrated Space Operations and Management System* (ISOMS) or *Unified Orbital Management Network* (UOMN).

Such a system would unify tracking, operational control, and traffic management functions, ensuring seamless coordination between monitoring orbital environments, controlling satellite constellations, and preventing collisions or other orbital conflicts. This integration would enable efficient and secure satellite operations in increasingly congested space environments.

Thanks Chat GPT!

I'm not suggesting that Rocket Lab will join other commercial entities participating in the CSP, there are already plenty of big names there including Kuiper and Starlink. Perhaps Rocket Lab may partner with some of them. But it occurs to me that if you want to build an end-to-end space company, that designs, builds and operates customer constellations, you'll need some of the same functionality that the TDRS provides NASA - and you may not want to rely on other commercial CSP entities to provide it.

Back over to Chat GPT:

**Describe a UOMN constellation? How many satellites? How many ground stations? What orbits required?**

A *Unified Orbital Management Network* (UOMN) constellation would likely require a combination of LEO (Low Earth Orbit) and MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) satellites to cover both tracking and communication needs. The number of satellites would depend on coverage requirements, but a network of 30‚Äì50 satellites could be sufficient for global tracking and communication.

Ground stations would be strategically placed worldwide, with at least 5‚Äì10 ground stations for redundancy and global reach. The system would also need robust inter-satellite links, especially for real-time traffic management and command/control capabilities.

Thanks Chat GPT!

OK so Rocket Lab would need some help with ground stations, and whilst they have their own RF space radios, they may also want to pick up some space optical expertise. With $300M in the Mergers & Aquisitions kitty, perhaps there are some targets?

RKLB_posts.csv,Important day for $RKLB [Specific Risk],"Hey everyone,

If you didn't know today was a crucial day for Rocket Lab. If you have been on this sub then that means there is a high propability you have seen posts relating to share lockup expiration.

Share lockup expiration is a lock-up agreement that **temporarily prevents company insiders from selling shares following an IPO. This agreement for Rocket Lab lasts for 6 months and** **expired yesterday** **at market close.** Meaning that insiders including VC, CEO, manager directors, staff, etc are able to sell their stock from now on.

If we think about it, Rocket Lab announced yesterday [Rocket Lab Selected by MDA to Design and Build Spacecraft for Globalstar](https://investors.rocketlabusa.com/news/news-details/2022/Rocket-Lab-Selected-by-MDA-to-Design-and-Build-Spacecraft-for-Globalstar/default.aspx) which are honestly some amazing news that brought the share price higher than the average stock. My opinion: this news was stratigically published on that specific day to allow 'insiders' sell some of their equity the day after at a higher price than if we didn't have news.

I like to assume that some insiders have sold a SMALL amount of their equity as a result of today's 4% drop. Lets not forget the staff that make Rocket Lab awesome receive equity as a form of bonus so it is rational for them to sell some of their bonuses at market price after waiting years for this company to become public.

From the price action we can determine that insiders have faith in the company (obviously) and will keep their equity for the long term. Now our fears from the lock up expiration can finally rest in peace.

PS: if you take a look at the chart below, the purple box shows the effect of share lockup expiration. In addition a cup and handle is forming in the 3m &15m chart which is a bullish pattern.

Their recent Talon-A1 test launch was nearly completely successful, ""approaching"" Mach 5 (the threshold for hypersonic flight), and they likely collected enough data for their next launch to be truly hypersonic. And both the carrier aircraft and Talon-A itself are reusable (well, the TA-1 version isn't, but TA-2 and TA-3 will be), so they have the potential to undercut HASTE (which is at best partially reusable) on price.

Now, obviously HASTE isn't a large proportion of Rocket Lab's revenue, and demand for hypersonic testbeds may grow fast enough that both Talon-A and HASTE are winning plenty of contracts. But the military has certainly shown interest in Stratolaunch's work, and if supply should grow enough to exceed their demand, it's not clear which company would get fewer launches as a result.",9,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1bdu1vg/stratolaunch_a_competitor_to_haste/,0.9624,0.134,0.832,0.034

Hydrogen in your expander cycle (with all the problems concerning hydrogen molecules on your turbine shafts and the required sealings) increases complexity and thereby costs greatly.

Hey Y'all, fellow RKLB investor here. I am currently a student working on my Masters in Space Operations at Embry Riddle and finished a paper talking about Rocket Lab. Take it for what you will, is not exactly a flawless product, but is my contribution to the community to educate folks about the company in hopes that our grass roots investment can help advance the industry.

Several posters have put articles from sites such as the Motley Fool, which may inspire FUD with would-be buyers or recklessly pump stocks for traders to inflate and dump shares to the detriment of a well meaning company. Through sheer-fucking-will Rocket Labs is standing toe to toe with giants and making a name for themselves in the industry and that deserves credit and truth.

I know profitability is a key factor considering how cash burn heavy this industry is. The capital raise from 2 weeks ago would have helped clear some debt out and added some cash for general ops. 

My biggest worry is how do we manage to grow revenue? Other then the big $500m contract ( over a few years). What else is in the pipeline?

I guess this is more for guidance. All eyes are on future guidance for fy24 and if I understand correctly, our total backlog was around $200m before the $500m contract was won.

RKLB_posts.csv,Rocket Lab risks justify the stock price,"First off, I am long Rocket Lab. I think its incredible what they've accomplished and I have a feeling they are going to be successful in delivering Neutron, eventually. But, I see an overwhelming number of posts and comments in this sub that express a disbelief in this stock's current price and its performance over the past year. I thought it might be worth reminding some RKLB investors of the risks that exist in this stock that likely explain why institutional sentiment has been what is has, even though the company and its accomplishments are incredible. Here are three entirely plausible things that could happen in the near term that would take this stock to all time lows.

&#x200B;

1. Another Electron failure

If the next Electron launch or another one in the next few months were to encounter another major issue or failure then Rocket Lab's reputation as a proven and reliable small launch shop would start to erode. The stock would undoubtedly take a hit at least as big as the one it took after the recent failure. Thats a big and totally feasible risk and could result in loss or slowing of contracts.

2. Neutron setbacks or failures

At this stage in Neutron's development, major delays are entirely possible. Worse than that, it is  completely possible that when Neutron is first launched it fails or explodes. Maybe there is a landing failure, after all landing is something Rocket Lab have never done before.

3. Dilution

Rocket Lab is in cash burning mode. If Neutron becomes more expensive than planned, or if #1 or #2 above were to happen they could issue more shares to raise money.

&#x200B;

Again, all three of the items above are completely feasible. Together they represent big risk for investors who buy in at this moment. If any of the above were to occur while the stock price is at its current levels then I think we'd likely see the $2 range.",34,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/17vtdys/rocket_lab_risks_justify_the_stock_price/,-0.9884,0.04,0.833,0.127

RKLB_posts.csv,The reaction wheel constellation deal is older than you think‚Ä¶,"‚Ä¶ and its probably already included in the backlog.

EDIT: I am probably wrong, I did not include the SolAero acquisition and their backlog in my analysis.
Sorry and thanks for pointing it out!

Q4‚Äò21 presentation:

""Backlog grew from $183M in Q3‚Äô21 to $241M in Q4‚Äô21, to $545M today"" (today = February 2022)

$143M of the difference is the MDA/Globalstar backlog, leaving about $150M

Additional hint in the Q4‚Äò21 presentation:
‚ÄûSigned deals to supply COMPONENTS for commercial constellations, including first mega constellation deal""

Here they are talking about components and mega constellation- so not about the MDA/globalstar contract which is for a whole satellite bus and not a mega constellation.

Additional hint in the 2022 investor day presentation:
""New high volume reaction wheel (>3,000 units/year) production capability established for constellations""

3000 units per year fits perfectly with the demand of the undisclosed mega constellation

I also found a press release from September 2021 already mentioning high volume reaction wheel production: 

""construction is underway on a new production facility capable of supplying up to 2,000 reaction wheels per year to fulfil growing demand from satellite constellation customers.""

Let‚Äòs assume, Amazon ordered all the Kuiper reaction wheels right away. That would be 3236 satellites x 4 reaction wheels = 12,944 reaction wheels

If we divide the increase in backlog in the beginning of 2022 we cannot explain ($150M) by the number of reaction wheels, we get $ 11.6 K per reaction wheel.

Does that fit?
RocketLabs CFO Adam Spice was quoted with ‚Äû""we brought the cost down by almost an order of magnitude on those wheels.‚Äù in a recent article (see appendix)
Price of a reaction wheel that size is $100 k for small volume customers.
So $11.6 K per reaction wheel seems like a reasonable price. 

Reaction wheels were a super low volume business so far. According to the Investor Day 2022 presentation Sinclair had just above 200 reaction wheel units in orbit. And those 200 are spread across different sizes. Just imagine the R&D cost per individual reaction wheel. And now compare that to a reaction wheel type you can sell 13,000 of.
Safe to guess that cost came down exponentially.

‚ÄúIn the short run, the market is a **voting machine** but in the long run it is a **weighing machine**.‚Äù

I have put the likely range in italic text, and my actual prediction in bold text.  For my own use, when revenue estimates change meaningfully, I will update the table - happy to share the updates if you are interested.

Notes / Caveats

Revenues for 2021, 2022 and 2023 are based on analyst estimates.  Revenues for 2024 and 2025 are extrapolated out using a revenue growth rate of 40% per annum.  If revenue estimates change dramatically, then so will my price forecasts.  I'm assuming RKLB will satisfy the '[Rule of 40](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/q42g9y/applying_the_rule_of_40_to_rklb/)'.

Yes hype and investor sentiment play a significant role in the price - but that is captured by the P/S metric.  A high P/S means investors are very confident, while a low P/S means the opposite.

I believe that the P/S will trend down as revenue growth is achieved, but in five years time it will still be nowhere near the market average of 3.15.  I think the valuation will still be pricing in a lot of new growth at that point.

If the macro environment changes dramatically, such as a stock market crash - then P/S will plummet and so will the share price.  A recession for example, could also have a knock on effect on revenues as organisations tighten there belts.  Maybe have some US Treasuries in your portfolio to give you a war chest during bad times, because if that does happen, and RKLB survive - it will be the dip of the century, and you will want to be buying.

In trading on Friday, shares of Rocket Lab USA Inc (Symbol: RKLB) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.9, after changing hands as low as $4.25 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 39.6. A bullish investor could look at RKLB's 29.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of RKLB shares:

&#x200B;

[Oversold](https://i.redd.it/ev5fkckx34591.gif)

Looking at the chart above, RKLB's low point in its 52 week range is $4.25 per share, with $21.34 as the 52 week high point ‚Äî that compares with a last trade of $4.27.

RKLB_posts.csv,"A multi billion contract with Amazon - Rocket Lab is supplying 12Nms reaction wheels to the Amazon's megaconstellation of 3,236 satellites, (3 to) 4 wheels per each satellite, (9,708 to) 12,944 12Nms reaction wheels with more required for maintenance and replacement","While the CEO spoke about 2,000 reaction wheels for a single customer this year, that Amaz...ing customer will eventually need 12,944\* 12Nms reaction wheels just to get the constellation into the space and then further thousands of reaction wheels for the maintenance and replacement.

If Amazon got a discount in the range of 10-30%, let's say 20% for purposes of this dive, this deal would translate into revenues between $1.035 billion and $1.242 billion, depending on the type of 12Nms reaction wheels. Further revenues would follow from reaction wheels sold for the maintenance and replacement of deorbited satellites.

There is no way that this deal is in the backlog in its entirety as the $1 billion backlog already comprises the $515 million SDA T2TL-Beta deal, $215 million in Electron launches, $143 million Apple/MDA deal, $32 million Victus Haze deal (this also includes launch, so I've deducted 8.5 million below), $30 million out of $150 million deal for solar cells for the space prime contractor and also deals with other Rocket Lab's customers (as ""x"" below).

515+215+143+23.5 + 30 + x = 926.5 + x

1014 (total backlog) - 926.5 (known backlog) - x (unknown backlog) = **87.5 - x**

**I don't see how can the deal for over 2,000 reaction wheels this year, which may be for $160 or $192 million, not even speaking about more than $1 billion for 12,944 reaction wheels for the whole constellation, be already comprised in less than $87.5 million of unidentified deals in the current backlog. It may be possible that only a very small portion of this deal is in the backlog.**

The FCC has given Amazon the deadline of July 2026 to launch 50% of the constellation, that is 1,618 satellites, which require 6,472\* 12Nms reaction wheels. These reaction wheels need to be delivered to Amazon well before July 2026 in order to allow for time to build satellites and to remedy any potential supply hiccups and/or production accidents. Let's say at least 3 months before the FCC deadline.

According to the CEO, this year, the Amaz...ing customer will consume over 2,000 reaction wheels from Rocket Lab, which translates into 500 satellites. **Amazon will need further 4,472 12Nms reaction wheels between Jan 2025 and April 2026**, which means that this further delivery should take place in space of 16 months. That is an average of 279.5 reaction wheels per month, or 838.5 reaction wheels per Q. **That would amount to quarterly revenues between $67 and $80.5 million (between $268 and $322 million per year), depending on the type of 12Nms reaction wheels, just from reaction wheels sold to Amazon.** Compare this to $60 million in revenues from all space systems customers in Q1 2024, which might include no revenue recognition from the Amazon deal.

The CFO stated that over $426 million of the current $1 billion backlog will be recognized in next 12 months. If 12Nms reaction wheels for Amazon were in the contract then subtracting $268 or $322 million for reaction wheels from the $426 million which will be recognized in next 12 months would leave only $158 or $104 million to be recognized from all other space systems revenue streams and launches. That would mean that Rocket Lab would do only 19 launches in next 12 months (till the end of May 2025) and that Rocket Lab would recognize zero revenues from any other space systems customer beside Amazon, which is nonsense. **12Nms reaction wheels are thus missing from the backlog.** **However, the deal exists as the CEO confirmed it. There is no other megaconstellation builder beside SpaceX and Amazon who would consume over 2,000 12Nms reaction wheels this year and while SpaceX is building their own reaction wheels, Amazon lacks such capability.**

**Let's go back to 2024. Over 2,000 12Nms reaction wheels in 2024 may translate into revenues of $160 million or $192 million, that is $40 million or $48 million per quarter if they would be recognized over the all quarters of 2024.**

These revenues do not seem to be recognized in Q1 2024 as space systems revenues increased by $8.5 million from $51.5 million (Q4 2023) to $60 million (Q1 2024).

Recognizing them over the remaining 3 quarters in 2024 would amount to a jump in revenues by $53 million or $64 million. There is a jump the the Q2 2024 guidance but not on such magnitude that it could be wholly attributed to a supply of 666 12Nms reaction wheels (1/3 of 2,000 to be consumed by Amazon this year).

This leaves us with a big potential jump in the Q3 2024 guidance.

\* 9,708, ie. 3 reaction wheels per satellite instead of 4 reaction wheels, would be contrary to redundancy and a risk taking that Amazon is not known for.

""*We can't really talk too much about that but I, you know, would say that, correct me if I'm wrong but we're on track for like 2000 wheels this year or something like that (...) we can apply that scale manufacturing to those other smaller volume orders and get the cost reductions that go on with. It should be a material margin enhancer to all the rest of the business as well. It's not just, you know, helpful that we're getting, that we have this megaconstellation customer (...)

RKLB_posts.csv,What many people miss about Rocket Lab,"I have seen a lot of posts on here and WSB that only discuss the launch side of Rocket Lab.

Rocket Lab is not just a launch company. They are way more than that. They are an end to end space company.

Take a look at these scenarios below.

Company X( basically all companies that need something in space to operate. Use ASTS for example): These companies design and build something that operates in space, but rely on another company to get their equipment there.

SpaceX: launch provider with an emphasis on launching their own constellation with further goals in space. We all know they can launch themselves.

Rocket Lab: started as a launch only company with Electron but have heavily diversified their business into space systems. Their business offers the ability to design, build, launch and operate a customers satellites or space craft or maybe their own constellation someday. This is why it is called end to end. Their business is not launch, launch is only one of their tools to more effectively do business in space. Neutron will not make or break this company. They do not rely in its success to make them profitable. They could stop development today and still be profitable in the future due to the way they have positioned themselves in the industry through their space system business segments. This type of position is going to be huge in the future as more people move their business into space.

I have followed this company for 3 years and they continue to impress me. Though launch is a very exciting part of this business, since it is really the only one we can see, I encourage every investor here to start viewing this company as an all around space company instead of just a launch company.

Sir Peter Beck.

**Wait, the CEO is knighted?**  
Yes, he's a New Zealander.

**Wait, the CEO of a significant aerospace company is a New Zealander?**  
Yeah, that's why it's unusual. It shows his intelligence in achieving something no one expected.

**Who are their competitors?**  
SpaceX, Blue Origin, Firefly, Stoke, and technically Astra.

**Wait, I only know two of those.**  
Two have never launched, and two haven't launched for ages.

**Wait, didn't one of those companies also get listed and then delisted?**  
Astra did that, and Virgin Orbit too, until they filed for Chapter 11.

**Ok, cool. What are Rocket Lab's competitive advantages over SpaceX and Blue Origin?**  
With Electron, smaller satellites that need to be launched sooner and to closer locations can be cheaper and more profitable over time compared to delays.

**Wait, why does their revenue recognition change so often over quarters?**  
Revenue for launches can only be recognized at launch, with 90% paid by launch day.

**How many launches are needed on Electron per year to be profitable?**  
Around 21.

**Wait, they didn‚Äôt launch that many per year.**  
First, consider revenue recognition. Delays are primarily on the client side.

**What do those do?**  
Star trackers, ion propulsion, solar panels, separation systems, and solar panels.

**How did they acquire these companies?**  
M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions).

**Wait, that‚Äôs like shopping for companies?**  
Yes, it's hinted that they may buy something for a new constellation.

**Who are their customers?**  
NASA, DOD, Space Force, and commercial customers.

As time has gone on and we have traded down in this range, all of their collective research has only lead to them wanting more shares, even surpassing previous share count goals/targets.

It felt like he more yolo'ed into the stock and was being a permabull. Whether or not that was originally true or just my incorrect opinion, I think Vince has really grown his knowledge on RKLB. The sheer number of videos he puts put forces him to listen to, read, and gather information for us. I feel like the last few videos he has produced lately have also demonstrated that.

RKLB_posts.csv,Huge component of the business not yet factored into share price,"I wanted to point out something that others have mentioned before, particularly Vince is Bullish:

Peter Beck has said more than once that Rocket Lab is aiming to launch 50% of their rockets for customers and 50% of their rockets for themselves. This is because one of the primary purposes of their business is to create some sort of space infrastructure akin to SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink - some type of constellation that provides a service with high value for customers and high profit margins for Rocket Lab.

SpaceX‚Äôs valuation ballooned (almost doubled) to $200B since Starlink has come online.

When ASTS simply mentioned their constellation contract with AT&T, their market cap 10x‚Äôd in 3 months (before they had put anything into space).

Rocket Lab is fully vertically integrated (ASTS had to use a SpaceX rocket to get their first 5 satellites for AT&T into orbit). Once Rocket Lab is ready to begin building their own constellation, they‚Äôll be able to do it at significantly lower cost than ASTS.

The only reason Rocket Lab‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt moved on these repeated announcements of Peter Beck‚Äôs 50/50 plan for the company is that they haven‚Äôt announced exactly what their constellation will be yet.

But anyone that knows this company can pretty safely assume it‚Äôll be a success that drives huge profits.

Remember, ASTS moved 10x on news of a constellation. Rocket Lab has announced a constellation too but there‚Äôs been zero movement (recent movement is due to other reasons like Neutron progress and price upgrades).

Once they announce the purpose of their constellation and provide a roadmap with more details, the stock could easily 2-5x in a handful of months. This will almost certainly occur simultaneously with the first successful flight of neutron or shortly after (6-12 months).

RKLB_posts.csv,Rocket lab becomes the next Orbital Sciences,"Full disclosure: was a shareholder of orbital sciences and am currently a shareholder in RKLB.

I am assuming that the most likely outcome for Rklb is similar to the trajectory taken by Orbital Sciences (OA). OA was purchased by Northrop in 2018 for $9B. Below are some of the similarities between the two. 

OA was founded as a novel commercial entry focused on distribution of the legacy space primes. 

OA developed a novel airborne launch vehicle called Pegasus that carried 443kg to LEO. Claimed as the first commercial developed launch vehicle. Parallels can be drawn between  Pegasus and Electron and their shared market niches (payload, novel commercial small launcher, support from DoD) . Obviously Electron has found product market fit far superior to Pegasus and is far cheaper but the parallels persist nonetheless. 

OA purchased Fairchild Industries, GDAIS and CTA to strengthen its position in satellite manufacturing similar to rational behind RKLB acquisitions of Sinclair, Plantery Systems, ASI, and SolAero. 

OA built the Dawn mission for NASA similar to RKLB and Escapade/Capstone.

OA built 150+ satellites to various government and commercial customers. 

OA developed the Antares launch vehicle that launched out of Wallops. Neutron has a similar payload and will launch a couple miles down the road. 

If Rklb follows the trajectory of OA then they will merge with another defense contractor (OA merged with ATK to strengthen its capabilities in solid rocket motors). I would venture that Rklb will eventually merge with a company like Kratos or Andriul.

RKLB_posts.csv,Musk says it was a employee motivation tactic to say SpaceX may go bankrupt - another risk removed from RKLB.,"On December 2nd - Elon Musk said SpaceX may go bankrupt due to delays on the Starship engine.  Right after there was a sell off in space related companies. 

Coincidence?  I don‚Äôt think so.  Reason is, if investor thought SpaceX could go bankrupt with Elon Musk at the helm, who‚Äôs to say Rocket Lab, Astra and others couldn‚Äôt ?  I mean they would be even more likely if anything.  

For Rocket Lab and other space companies to succeed they need SpaceX to succeed, so now that Elon Musk‚Äôs comments have been clarified I believe this will certainly boast space related companies, including Rocket Lab.

RKLB_posts.csv,Soon the fund managers will be buying into RocketLab,"Taking a look at UFO ETF or Cathie Wood‚Äôs Space Exploration fund, neither of them YET have RocketLab.

Many space companies cannot execute or do so very slowly and have huge problems.  Have no revenue now, Virgin Galactic is one example.  But RocketLab can execute, deliver, already is bringing in business and has a scalable business model.   This is the Type of business that large fund managers want to buy into.  Given their business model, this will be a prime target for fund managers to buy into.  Certainly one of the better SPACs out there.",18,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/pwitvk/soon_the_fund_managers_will_be_buying_into/,0.891,0.11,0.867,0.022
RKLB_posts.csv,How to accelerate Rocket Lab's growth,"Rocket Lab has correctly positioned itself as a vertically-integrated player in the rapidly growing New Space economy. From components to systems, spacecraft, constellations, and through to launch, on-orbit operations, and space-based application solutions, Rocket Lab has built up the capability to ‚Äúdo what it says it‚Äôs going to do.‚Äù More importantly, as it has built up these capabilities, it‚Äôs done so with a success rate that approaches 100%. Rocket Lab does not fail, or at least hasn‚Äôt failed so far. As Beck is heard to say in Wild Wild Space,¬†""I‚Äôm not built to build shit.‚Äù

Yet there are tradeoffs to be made between organic growth and growth gained through acquisitions. Yes, building up capabilities in-house at a place like Rocket Lab ensures that the results meet and often exceed immediate and long-term requirements. Whereas the challenges of an acquisition include cultural fit and other integration challenges as well as inevitable product evolution to meet internal requirements. The biggest expense of internal development is the opportunity cost. Though an acquisition costs actual cash, you‚Äôre buying a capability that‚Äôs closer to market already.

While Rocket Lab has¬†**capabilities**, it has limited¬†**capacity**. The New Space economy is growing so fast that Rocket Lab doesn‚Äôt have enough time to hire the number of top-flight team members needed to grow their business from the inside. But the company‚Äôs anemic market cap makes it nearly impossible to acquire top-flight technologies to keep up with requirements, opportunities, and capacity.

As I see it, there are 4 possible scenarios that will allow the company to optimize growth and fully realize its potential:

1. The market must respond to Rocket Lab‚Äôs potential to such an extent that the market cap grows by multiples.
2. An outside equity investor must be found to invest $1 billion or more to fund¬†acquisitions, but diluting existing investors in the process.
3. Rocket Lab must merge or even be acquired by another company with compatible capabilities/capacity and access to significant capital.
4. Rocket Lab can continue to grow organically with the opportunities and challenges it currently faces.

The market may give greater recognition to Rocket Lab once Neutron reaches orbit. But the stated scale up of launch cadence is incremental, spanning several years before it can deploy a constellation like the Falcon 9 is doing for StarLink. Even with a 70% annual growth rate, it‚Äôll take many years to reach the scale implied by Peter Beck‚Äôs vision.

RKLB_posts.csv,Advice to small investors on RKLB - Stay away from buying options for a while.,"This is an advice to small investors who are entering the market from an experienced investor who did lose money playing options.

Options are very tempting at the moment given the run RKLB had this quarter. Every stock will have pullback. When it does, time value eat away potential profits.

Your best bet through earnings is to buy the stock and sell out of the money covered calls for November end. The money you make from the covered calls, you can put it back into RKLB to increase your share count. Don't despair if your options are called. Do it again.

Consider buying options when RSI goes below 40 and MACDs are in negative territory. This is where technical analysis will help you.

If the options you bought are expiring worthless, you giving free money to whales. A $1000 from you pocket may not seem much. But a hundred players like yourself giving free money to whales every week is Big Whale Money.

RKLB_posts.csv,Will RKLB's share price double this year? - Re-revisiting my post from 2024/04/29,"Today, on 2024/08/16, RKLB reached $7.10, more than doubling from its YTD low of $3.47 on 2024/04/16. Hell yeah!

  
[My old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1cfjtco/will_rklbs_share_price_double_this_year/)¬†from 2024/04/29 follows below:

RKLB share price has a history of doubling from its low during the summer and then falling down to repeat the process next year. So far, it has happened every and each year since its listing on the stock market:

* **2021: $9.5 to $21.34 from 2021/08/27 to 2021/09/09**
* **2022: $3.53 to $7.15 from 2022/06/30 to 2022/08/12**
* **2023:**¬†**$3.76 to $8.05 from 2023/05/09 to 2023/07/19**

The 2024 low has been reached on 2024/4/16 at $3.47. What has changed from previous years besides the company's increased performance is that¬†**the reported short interest YTD has increased by 161% from 22m to 58m shorted shares**. This huge increase right before the summer may cause a bound of a violent volatility once the 2024 doubling commences.

RKLB trades so cheaply and it is so heavily shorted that all that may be needed to revalue its stock is a shift in sentiment. Right now the stock is pricing in the most bearish of bearish outcomes. Delayed Neutron development, increased R&D costs and Electron's obsolescence. But Rocket Lab is the only space company dedicated to being a one stop shop for space applications. Suppose over this year, the management can craft a narrative that Neutron is really coming this year/early next year and with it a significant decrease in R&D costs and the growth and capture of launch and space system markets. Such sentiment shift may take time but I don't know, there are so many unusual factors with Rocket Lab that I could see it happening rapidly.

I am not betting that Rocket Lab is going to stage the most epic growth of all time. I am just betting on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06).
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year.

RKLB_posts.csv,SpaceX Raptor Development timeline,"I summarized the Wikipedia article for the Raptor development timeline- so we can estimate more accurately where Rocket Lab is right now with Archimedes.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor#

Keep in mind:
- SpaceX was the far more experienced (and financially capable) company during Raptor development. Falcon9 was already launching reliably during that time and SpaceX was able financially to try several approaches at once and save time
- the raptor full flow stage combustion combustion cycle is far more complicated than RocketLabs oxygen rich staged combustion cycle + SpaceX aimed for 3x the thrust for a similarly sized engine.
- SpaceX had access to the E2 test stand at Stennis. That test stand is capable of supplying high pressure, high temperature fuel/oxygen/nitrogen to test individual components of a staged combustion engine. Beck was arguing that they could not test most of the components beforehand and will have to the test the whole system at once- let‚Äòs hope that works out.

Space X Raptor development timeline:

- 2012, November: Musk announces work on a Methane fueled rocket engine
- 2014: injector testing
- 2015 April-August: ox rich preburner testing (-> RKLB in Q4 2023 pres.: preburner testing component done)
- 2016, August: first full scale engine (not only individual components, the whole engine) for testing shipped
- 2016 26. September: First Full scale, whole engine test
- 2018 September: 71 seconds engine test
- 2019 July: First Starhopper tests
- 2023: first Starship flight

Archimedes:
- 2021 March: Introducing Neutron
- 2022 September: Switch to staged combustion cycle announced
- 2023 Q2: 1st full scale thrust chamber complete, Injector + Preburner testing underway
- 2023 Q4: ‚ÄûAll engine components either complete or in final stages of production.‚Äú
‚ÄûTest campaign has successfully proved out element design across the full throttle range which has been incorporated into the full-scale pre-burner.‚Äú

- 2024 Q2: Supposed full engine testing

My thesis was that RKLB has doubled from lows each year since its SPAC IPO and that 2024 will be no different in this regard. I've bet on 4 things:

1. It is highly unlikely that Rocket Lab with 600 mil. in cash and 1 bil. in backlog is worth 1.8 bil. - this holds true at the current valuation.
2. The backlog has increased by 108% YoY and the revenue is expected to have increased by 70% YoY (we'll know on 2024/05/06). - this was true and we're now expecting much higher Q2 revenues (+30% QoQ) and another doubling of the backlog.
3. Rocket Lab's space systems business and Electron launch business are worth between 8 bil. and 10 bil. dollars. - this still holds true, the demand for Electron was confirmed by the Synspective's order of 10 Electron launches and app. 7 HASTE launches between 2024 and 2025.
4. There's a non-zero chance that Neutron may launch this year and that the Kuiper contract announcement comes once production Kuiper satellites are launched in the second half of this year. - Neutron will not launch this year but Kuiper satellites are still scheduled for the launch in the second half of this year.

My thesis is still intact. Even though it is too early to do the victory lap, RKLB is now mere 30% away from doubling since its all time lows and there are many catalysts on the horizon. For example, the upcoming Archie hot-fire test (I love that Archimedes' nickname), Ashlee Vance's Wild Wild Space documentary on HBO MAX, the common run up to the earnings report and, of course, the FOMC cutting the rates this year.

Let me know your opinion.

RKLB_posts.csv,Using the 'Rule of 40' to sanity check the valuation of RKLB,"In a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/q42g9y/applying_the_rule_of_40_to_rklb/), I applied the Rule of 40 to assess the growth potential of RKLB.  The R40 is a great tool to help you wrap your head around the exponential growth potential of a stock.  The R40 principle states that a company‚Äôs combined sales growth rate and profit margin should be at least 40%, and ideally better.

     Rule of 40 = Revenue Growth Rate + Profit Margin

In his book *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, Daniel Kahneman demonstrates how intuitively bad humans are at statistics, and I think exponential growth is a great example of this; just look at how shocking it is when a handful of Covid cases turn into millions.

The valuations of growth stocks must be pricing in exponential revenue growth - otherwise how does a company like RKLB with $54M of annual revenue command a market capitalization of $6,600M?

The R40 is handy little rule of thumb, a score of 40 or more tells you that revenues are growing exponentially with doubling time of circa two years or less.  Assuming profits are reinvested for growth.  But how do we decide if that is sufficient to justify the market capitalization?

I've put together a formula that attempts to provide a framework for answering that question. This formula allows investors to judge how many years they think is sensible for RKLB to become a mature company, and what the would take in terms of R40 between now and then.  For now, let's define some terms:

    i = Initial Annual Revenue = $54M (estimate for 2021)
    c = Market Capitalization = $6600M
    m = S&P 500 Average Price to Sales Ratio = 3.15
    t = Target Annual Revenue = c / m = $2095M

If RKLB was a mature company, you might expect it's revenue to be in line with the price to sales ratio of the wider market.  So for a $6600M company, that would be an annual revenue of $2095M.  A little over $2B. My formula, tells you the R40 required to achieve the Target Annual Revenue within Y years:

|Years to Target Annual Revenue (Y)|R40 Required|
|:-|:-|
|1|3780|
|2|523|
|3|239|
|4|150|
|5|108|
|6|84|
|7|69|
|8|58|
|9|50|
|10|44|
|11|39|
|12|36|

So for RLKB to achieve \~$2B annual revenue inside one year, they would need an R40 of 3780.  That's obviously not going to happen.  As per my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/q42g9y/applying_the_rule_of_40_to_rklb/), RKLB's R40 next year is forecast to be 199.  IF, they could maintain that level of growth, they would get to $2B in around 3-4 years.  But that is spectacular growth, perhaps they are unlikely to be able to sustain that level for very long.  On the other hand, maybe they will.

If we assume that an R40 of 40 is achievable over the medium term, then RKLB will get to the revenue target in about 10-11 years.  I think that's pessimistic personally, given that next year their R40 is forecast to be 199.  Based on current estimates, I suspect Y will fall somewhere between those two extremes.

The main conclusion that I draw from this analysis, is that new revenue streams are everything when valuing a speculative growth company.  Not so much because a $24M contract is great in and of itself, but because of what it suggests about the rate of growth and how long it might take to be generating substantial revenues.

I think this analysis is worth keeping up to date, because new revenue streams can massively affect the time we estimate that it takes RKLB to achieve substantial revenue flows.  Those financial updates will be critical.  If the revenue pipeline really starts to fill up, then the valuation looks increasingly cheap.  If growth proves elusive, the valuation starts to look expensive.  At this stage, we really are speculating - but I personally have faith RKLB will deliver excellent R40.

I arrived at the formula by starting with the exponential growth function, and rearranging the formula to make the growth rate the subject of the formula, expressed as a percentage value (as the R40 is).  Here is the formula in case anyone wants to check my workings or use it themselves.

    i = Initial Annual Revenue
    t = Target Annual Revenue
    r = Growth Rate
    R = Rule of 40
    Y = Number of Years
    c = Market Capitalization = $6600M
    m = S&P 500 Average Price to Sales Ratio = 3.15
    
    t = i(1+r)^Y
    t/i = (1+r)^Y
    (t/i)^(1/Y) = 1+r
    (t/i)^(1/Y) = 1+(R/100)
    R = 100(((t/i)^(1/Y)) - 1)
    
    t = c / m
    
    R = 100((((c/m)/i)^(1/Y)) - 1)

I'm confident the formula works, because if you take any value of R40 from the table above, and grow the Initial Annual Revenue of $54M by that figure Y number of times, you arrive at the Target Annual Revenue of $2095M, rounding errors aside.  But I welcome the community to check my workings.

**TLDR** \- the *rate* of revenue growth is everything when valuing speculative growth stocks, as their valuation basically prices in exponential revenue growth.  Any significant updates to revenue forecasts will dramatically affect the valuation and therefore the stock price.",21,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/q5bwrn/using_the_rule_of_40_to_sanity_check_the/,0.9987,0.156,0.825,0.019

RKLB_posts.csv,Valuation ,"I keep seeing comments that RKLB is cheap and SpaceX is overvalued. Or other commentary that sounds like it is based on faith and not thought out metrics. Full disclosure I'm bullish on both. 

Morgan Stanley has probably one of the most publicly available in-depth analysis of SpaceX value. They note that 60% of the value is in Starlink. That would make SpaceX rocket side about a $75B valuation. Given their launch revenue was estimated to be $5.5B for 2024 that is a revenue multiplier of 13.6x. Apply that to Rocket lab and you get a valuation of $10b on $245m of revenue and you have a revenue multiplier of 40.8x. 

RocketLab's launch business is three times more expensive to buy than SpaceX's right now. Not sure SpaceX is overvalued (on launch).  Starship is arguably a much bigger leap than Neutron (new model vs providing a launch alternative to existing model). So, not sure how SpaceX can be called overvalued and at the same time saying RocketLab has room for another 150% gain ($50 share).

If this is correct (and it was quick and sort price analysis), does RKLB benefit from IPO access and demand for the sector that cannot be easily accessed via SpaceX? Is there something else driving the multiplier difference? Yes both companies do more than launch, but one has turned that into revenue while the other is just starting down that path. And that portion of the valuation is pulled out of SpaceX in the above analysis and assumed to be $0 for RKLB. 

Maybe that's the difference. That the market is already valuing the non-launch business at even more astronomical multipliers than SpaceX's non-launch business.",62,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1gs6fmx/valuation/,0.8615,0.063,0.912,0.025

RKLB_posts.csv,Vulcan Delay > Rocket Lab Impact.,"So here are some facts

1. Vulcan upperstage needs redesigning and testing. Which will cause a delay of Vulcan Test Flight atleast untill Q1 2024

2. Kuijper test sats were planned to launch on Vulcan Test Flight. 

3. Rocketlab can not announce a deal of 250million worth of reaction wheels before the test sats of that consolation (probably amazon) are launched.

Here is some bad news speculation based on these facts. Feel free to challenge me on this!

- If Amazon is part of the new deal and they decide to wait for Vulcan. It will probably mean a delay to manufacturing and launching the constellation. If this is the case it would most definitely mean Rocket Lab will not see any revenue from those reaction wheels before and probably also not during Q1 2024. Some extra risks will be : further delays and cost of maintaining factory without production.

Question : What are the choices for Amazon to launch on a different launch vehicle for their test sats?

Here is some potential good news.

- Some people have already suggested a delay in Vulcan could mean Neutron would be a logical choice to launch Kuijper Sats. If Rocket Lab deliverers on time, have a successful test flight and could get a cadence in quick. Which on every count would be world-class as far as I am concerned. Either way in my opinion Neutron would be fully booked for a long time. 

I also want to nuance something about Rocket Lab abilities with Electron and the upcoming Neutron cadence. If your look at any modern space company. SpaceX and Rocket Lab are the only ones who have achieved a good cadence. Note they both only achieved it with one rocket system (Electron/Haste and F9/FH). I think with the experience they have with scaling a launch cadence. It will make it easier to get to a good launch cadence quicker with Neutron and Starship. If you look at Starship, if it weren‚Äôt for the pad. The next one would have launch already. So just wanted to let you guys think about that.

RKLB_posts.csv,Thoughts on share price and revenue based valuation,"-----I don't mean to spread FUD or intend this post to call out the stock, I genuinely want to stimulate conversation regarding  RKLB fair valuation vs other similar companies-----

My background is in VC, mostly early stage but I am familiar with late stage as well, although RKLB is still far from profitable and therefore not as late stage as being a publicly traded company would suggest.   

Hardware/space companies which are pre profit, but show great promise, as RKLB does, typically are valued at 3-10x revenue, depending on how close they are to profitability. From the last earnings report, Rocket Lab earned $40.7m USD in Q1,2022. Extrapolated out to a full year, this is $168.2mUSD. if we take 3-10x revenue to valuation multiple, we get a company value of around 0.5-1.6B USD. That equates to a share price of between $1-3.4USD. That is still well below the current share price of $4 even in the optimistic end. Rklb are currently at a revenue to valuation multiple of 12x. 

Planet Labs is a good space company to compare to. They have similar revenue ($40.1mUSD in Q1,2022), are much closer to profitability, are also arguably a very promising company, but are only at a revenue multiple if 8.5. 

I'm interested to hear from y'all why such a high revenue multiple is apparently justified for RKLB compared to similar companies, especially when they are much further from profitability?

RKLB_posts.csv,In response to the bears (aka the liberal arts bull case for RKLB),"A few days ago I had an exchange with a guy who posted various pics Archimedes vs Raptor rockets.   A link to the thread ( https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/s/HOahYRJsur ), but the guy‚Äôs comments were deleted either by himself or the mods(?).  

In any event, it started out as just one of any number of posts going on about space x being so far ahead that nobody can compete.  I think the poster was a provocateur but also argued in good faith.  I found him to be broadly representative of a demographic of investor whose biases (technical snobbery and industry experience) are commonly found in arguments against Rocket Lab.  I think that those points are worth further discussion. 

I‚Äôm NOT an engineer (and this poster snidely pointed this out, in response to my comment that I don‚Äôt care about Archimedes looking like a wiry mess compared to Raptor).  I‚Äôm also not a quant of any type.  I focus on soft factors - culture, broad market structure, political and social movements.  I am a liberal arts shit head investor, and am proud to be one.  I was on NVIDIA in early 2022 (after many techies, yes,  but still before the market as a whole) because I read some novels about AI and read about GPT 3.  Not to toot my own horn, but focusing on soft factors like ‚Äúhow will other people perceive this technology?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhere are the potential bottlenecks in developing it?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat companies are critical to this but have relatively low overall public awareness?‚Äù were critical to pointing me to Nvidia.  Much of the same analysis points me to Rocket Lab.

‚ÄúRocket Lab is technically inferior to Space X‚Äù.  Nobody disputes this. I take it as a given.  There is a wide gulf.  But does it matter?  Only if the technological gap cannot be overcome in the long run.  Why would Space X have an insurmountable technological moat?  It could only be one of three reasons:

1. The tech is too hard to replicate
2. The talent for developing the tech will only be at Space X
3. Space X will drive its competitors out of business before they can attain technological parity. 

As to 1, this is not true.  Saturn V rockets have existed for like 50 years.  Building rockets is hard but it does not require any significant breakthrough in fundamental science to match Space X.  I think this is not controversial.  It‚Äôs a question of scaling, money, processes, quality control, not fundamental scientific knowledge. 

As to 2: the commenter argued something to the effect that given space X‚Äôs advantage, no engineer would want to work for RKLB. This , frankly , struck me as prime Boomer Logic.  We have seen time and again that top talent wants to take risks and get exposure to upside.  Yes many engineers like to work for a more established company, but many will simply want the challenge, glory, and financial rewards associated with working for start up (or in RKLBs case, a mature start up with room to run).  

As to 3: Beck himself often rightly points out that monopolies usually do not last in the long run.  While this is less true in extremely capital intensive industries , he is generally correct and his point is buttressed by 2 additional facts.  A) space is a national security issue and B) Space X is and must remain a privately held company ( if it is to continue to pursue its mars goal).

I asked the poster to tell me who controlled airplane manufacturing during World War 2.  He responded a small number of companies incestuously subcontracted with each other and later consolidated into a handful of mega contractors due to government intervention. He made my point for me.  Vital national defense concerns are never run by pure monopoly; oligopoly is the rule.  This is because the market is artificial.  The government cannot tolerate a single company having a chokehold on vital capacity such as launch and space systems manufacture.  It requires somewhat competitive bidding.  It requires redundancies.  It also requires its contractors to satisfy national security laws regarding sourcing, supply chain, secrecy, clearances, etc.  Rocket Lab has come farther than any of its direct competitors (other than, obviously, Space X) in terms of being able to satisfy the governments requirements and delivering a product that works as advertised.  At minimum, Rocket Lab can deliver components for other launch providers ; the best case is that it can be one of 3-4 major government contractors in terms of taking payloads into orbit. 

The private vs public structure is also quite important.  Public companies are subject to disclosure laws that do not apply to private companies.  Control is dispersed, not concentrated in one person or small group.  This is a superior governance structure for the purposes of winning public confidence and political support.  Space X cannot go public in the near term because its stated goal of going to Mars will be severely compromised by introducing any form of outside governance.  I do take Musk at his word; mars is THE objective. Thus, it must remain in the hands of an idiosyncratic billionaire with many political enemies.  All the more reason for US and world governments to foster competition and incubate alternatives. 

None of this is to say that rocket lab will come out as one of the favored group of competitors- it is still a long, hard road with a lot of risk.  But I do not buy the thesis that SpaceX is untouchable and I do believe that RKLB is one of the top contenders.",104,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1g8mmdo/in_response_to_the_bears_aka_the_liberal_arts/,0.9926,0.122,0.802,0.076

RKLB_posts.csv,Conversion price determination,"I'm pretty happy with the 300M financing, especially seeing the 4.250% interest rate they got.

The deal is complex, but seems well explained in this comment https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1ahgilo/article_on_share_offering/kooqygq/ 

What I'm not so happy with is the way conversion price for the deal was determined. The conversion price (and the capped call strike price) was based on the stock price at close on Feb 1.

The price ended up at $4.02, down more than 17% from $4.85 at close the previous day. That's 17% extra dilution in 2027 if the stock goes up past the conversion price. Also, dilution becomes much more likely!

I think that is pretty messed up. Why not go for a conversion price based on stock price average over a period? And why would the point in time be just after partial details of the deal was announced, causing the stock price to crash?
The crash in the stock price was pretty predictable. 

Also, the deal put RKLB in a position where every institutional lender taking part in the deal would know about the conversion price determination time, and have a massive incentive to push the stock price down as low as possible on close Feb 1.

RKLB_posts.csv,A revelation I‚Äôve come to realise,"One of the biggest unknowns we‚Äôve had about Neutrons commercial success, is how well it will actually compete with Falcon 9. I for example, have always been hopeful, but a bit unsure about the fact that Neutron can only put 13 Tons into LEO in reusable configuration, compared to a much higher offering from Falcon 9.

Until the penny dropped that Falcon 9 is a mature design that‚Äôs been in production and service for well over a decade, and has seen many iterations and evolutions over it‚Äôs life.

I searched it up, Falcon 9s first ever iteration ‚Äúv1.0‚Äù could only put 9 tonnes into LEO, and it wasn‚Äôt reusable. The second iteration ‚Äúv1.1‚Äù could put 13 tonnes into LEO, and wasn‚Äôt reusable. It wasn‚Äôt until v1.2 came about in 2015 that it could then put 18.5 tons into LEO in reusable configuration and 22.8 Tons into LEO as an expendable rocket. It then later got refined into its next iteration ‚ÄúBlock 5‚Äù, but it‚Äôs payload capacity stayed the same, and the en you‚Äôve got Falcon Heavy which obviously has the higher capacities again.

So when you compare this to Neutron, it‚Äôs starting out brilliantly already. Considering Neutron is a foetus and Falcon 9 is a fully matured vehicle by now, and even so, F9 in its current state can only put 5.5 more tons into orbit than Neutron can (with both in LEO reusable configuration respectively). 

It‚Äôs safe to assume that as Neutron and Archimedes go through the development process and receive updates/iterations as it goes through its life and matures, that Neutron will be a very strong contender to Falcon 9. I mean, we already know that Archimedes in it‚Äôs current stage of life, will be operated at pretty low stress levels. And even at low stress levels, it‚Äôs starting considerably further ahead than where Falcon 9 started its life. Over the years of neutron being in service, when Rocket Lab refine and improve on their base design of neutron, when they learn more about Archimedes and how far they can push it whilst still being reliable to launch again and again and again, it seems safe to assume that Neutrons payload capacity will see decent payload improvements.

But my main point to realise is that Neutron is starting its life, leaps and bounds ahead of where Falcon 9 started its life, in terms of payload capacity and the fact that it will be reusable right from the outset. Obviously, this isn‚Äôt all down to Peter Beck masterclass, it‚Äôs been over a decade since F9 came to life, and technology has moved on since then. Still though, with this in mind, I feel a lot more confident about the argument of ‚ÄúHow will Neutron compete with Falcon 9‚Äù. 

Will we see a neutron heavy? I doubt it but I‚Äôd love to be proven wrong in 5-10 years time. But with this in mind, not even taking into account that certain clients may pick rocket lab purely because it‚Äôs the only option that isn‚Äôt Elon Musk, AND the fact that Rocket Lab will offer end to end space services unlike SpaceX, AND the fact that Rocket Lab missions are tailored to their customers better and have a more precise orbit insertion, I think it‚Äôs pretty reasonable to assume that Neutron will at the very least, give Falcon 9 a good run for their money. 

The only thing that does still worry me slightly is that Falcon 9 has more than paid off for it‚Äôs self by now, so SpaceX will be able to price gouge/undercut Rocket Lab as much as they want (within reason), and Rocket Lab can only lower their prices so far to match it, after all, they have years of neutron service ahead of them to pay off the development costs.",58,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/RKLB/comments/1fttb0l/a_revelation_ive_come_to_realise/,0.9898,0.109,0.836,0.055

1. US/China space race heating up. China is seen as a ""pacing challenge"" by the US military. Last time this shit happened during the Cold War, NASA spending reached 4.5% of federal budget. 

2. NO to monopoly. National security shit is not allowed to have a monopoly. Spacex will never be the only player. And it's valued at 200 bil, almost 50x what rklb is worth.

3. The huge TAM of space services in general. Lunar exploration, mars, LEO sats, spy sats, LEO experimental medicine, low gravity manufacturing etc. A lot of it is speculative you say? Well that's what investing in tech is about aye? You're looking for the NEXT BIG THING, not the last big thing. You might as well do GEICO and Coca Cola if you're of that bent. 

4. Actual working rocket and workable path to another big ass rocket. How many other companies you know put their money where their mouth is and can execute to a high level. Shit, even bezos is fking up with blue origin. I have more confidence in someone who has actually made a rocket fly, than some shit that's still on the pad. 

5. A good underpromise over deliver CEO. Sir Beck doesn't shoot his mouth off. Wanna know what that means? It means if he's anything like Musk, share price would be a multiple of what it is with hype. And I'm all for execute first hype later. 

6. Improving macro environment. Last time we had a massive reduction in rates after 08, there's a boom for 10 years. 2011 to 2021 were some of the best times in the market.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/05/blue-origin-ceo-dave-limp-brings-urgency-to-jeff-bezos-space-company.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/05/blue-origin-ceo-dave-limp-brings-urgency-to-jeff-bezos-space-company.html)

Tbh. that news is shocking. BlueOrigin spend billions of dollars and years of development (development started in 2011, was announced in 2014, first launch in January 2024) and right now they need 10 days to produce 1 engine?  
RocketLab started development of Archimedes in 2021, as a ox rich cycle in September 2022.  
We won't come by exact production numbers, but my educated guess is that they are currently producing about 1 engine per month.

In the Q2 earnings presentation they wrote that engine 2 were coming off the production line. 5 more were in production. And as Peter Beck wrote in context with the recent Archimedes video, engine number 3 already should fix the copper issue.

RKLB_posts.csv,Diversifying in space stocks beyond RKLB,"Out of the main space stocks im aware of (RKLB, LUNR, ASTS, RDW), RKLB is my favorite but I have done some research on it and watched a lot of YouTube videos and it is currently about 50% of my portfolio. 

Wondering what you guys think about diversifying into other space stocks like the others I mentioned, to not have too much money invested in one company. 

If you do invest in other space stocks, what are they and why do you hold them instead of just adding to RKLB?

For my very little research in the other 3 companies, LUNR stands out to me as possibly being the one I would consider adding next, but if I did it would be a much smaller amount compared to RKLB. Maybe 1/20th-1/10th of the ammount I have in RKLB.

RKLB_posts.csv,"Implied Volatility (IV) Skew for RKLB, unified for three approaching option expiration dates: August 2, August 9, and August 16","**Implied Volatility (IV):**¬†IV is a measure of the market's forecast of a likely movement in a security's price. It often rises in bearish markets and falls in bullish markets, as higher IV corresponds to higher expected risk or uncertainty.

**IV Skew:**¬†This shows the difference in IV across different strike prices for option contracts. Different IVs for different strikes reflects the market's expectations of the likelihood of different outcomes.

This skew is showing that the market is *positioning* and *hedging* for a large potential move up OR down within the coming weeks.

To be clear, this is to be taken with a grain of salt, the option chain is just one of many data inputs that investors should consider. But for what its worth, alongside the IV skew, **open interest** and **put/call volume** on the option chain are also quite bullish.

Another thought I had was it is significantly easier to launch rockets closer to the equator as SpaceX now does in Boca Chica TX.  Most US launch pads are in the southern states to take advantage of being closer to the equator.  Where as rocket labs launch pads are about half way to the pole.

The earnings call was the main driving force for the share price rocketing up.¬† Shorts were caught napping and they desperately had to scramble to cover their positions which probably drove the share price up even more to the new ATH of >$27. As a result, short interest decreased dramatically (\~20%) from the previous month. Short interest was still high at \~49.28 million shares short or \~13% of the float as of 11/29/2024. I think new shorts have since then opened new short positions (this is how shorts typically react after a massive price spike) and they‚Äôre heavily shorting the stock which is partially causing the downtrend in the share price.¬† The other reason for the downtrend in the share price is probably due to profit taking.¬† My thinking is that we will see share price consolidation in the $20 - 22 range at least in the near term.

SpaceX_posts.csv,How useful would a Mega-helicopter be to the spaceflight industry.,"Spacex has recently landed its first-stage using solely its merlin engines for all the phases of the landing. It has also been rumored (or stated I can't say for sure) that it intents to recover their payload fairings via parachute and helicopter. On top of that they're still looking at ways to recover the second stage. 

Getting that second stage back on land with such a strong thrust to weight ratio while enduring the fierce reentry seems almost impossible. But what if we could skip the landing burn and have the second stage use all its leftover fuel during the deorbit and reentry burn. Being much lighter, it will heat less during reentry and will quickly slow down with the airflow. You open up a supersonic drag chute plus parachute and finally you grab it with the yet-to-be-built megacopter and gently dispose of it on an ASDS which has arms to grab the stage and therefore requires no landing leg.

My assumption is if that yet-to-be-built megacopter suddenly appears tomorrow it would have a tremendous effect on spaceflight industry. If that helicopter can recover something the size of the F9 second stage it could also recover a firefly alpha first stage or an Electron (rocket lab) or launcher one first stage and even anything which is in the mass range of 20 tons and can reliably do the first half of the journey back to land (boostback/deorbit burn and reentry burn while surving reentry.

I consider the landing burn to be insanely much harder to execute than the other two burns. It requires extreme precision, little margin for error and is the most fuel-inefficient as it requires the most throttling actions. A rocket equipped for a landing burn will always require a huge number of sub-scaled engine to have a low enough TWR.

So if this yet-to-be-built helicopter existed how hard would it be to make the parachute system capable of slowing the core to about 100-150 km/h ?

Building a helicopter capable of recovering a  20t metal bar zooming at 150 km/h downward is possible IMO. Such a helicopter could be able to lift (not slow down) more than 50 tons. It has not been done simply because until recently it didn't have any use to anyone. The military don't need such an oversize helo that would certainly consumes shitload of kerozine for little use and autonomy.

However a mega-helicopter designed to recover a rocket from the sky wouldn't bother itself with fuel-efficiency and autonomy more than is needed and would be power-focused. It would carry no humans onboard and fly above the unhabited ocean  easing the task to get flight certification from the FAA. 

The most powerful helicopter flying today is the russian Mi-26 capable of lifting 20 tons or ... an american Chinook (see the famous photo). The yet-to-be-built megacopter needs to carry two and a half times more while being much more agile.

The agility can be achieved by the lack of life support requirements onboard for humans therefore dedicating the entire fuselage to the mission. In terms of power, history has showed us that with helicopter it seems to be possible to just, in the most straightforward manner, scale things up. The Mi-26 is just a normal helicopter design with 2 insanely powerful turboshafts (12000 hp each). Such powerful turboshaft are common nowadays they equip most large airliners (a turbofan is driven by a turbojet which can be quite easily converted to turboshaft). The most powerful helicopter ever flown was the russian V-12 capable of carrying 40 tons which used 4 turboshaft of 1960's design. The V-12 itself first flown in 1968 the year of the moon landing.

I have the intuition that helicopter technologies have not much evolved since the 70's and that it could have huge applications for spaceflight if we could scale up the power just like the 747 scaled up the power for aircraft and opened new industries (mass tourism for this case).

I want to know your thought about it and how hard would it be to catch a 20 tons rocket core zooming from space and what would be the requirement in terms of parformance of such a megacopter.

SpaceX_posts.csv,Possibility of the return of the Falcon 1?,"The Falcon 1 was a rocket built to launch small payload satellites (up to 430 kg to SSO). SpaceX had a lot of interest in such a rocket when they announced it in the early aughts and in fact had payloads on their first three launches. But by the time they got the fourth launch done and proved a working system the potential customers never materialized. There was only one more launch of the Falcon 1 and then the company moved on to the Falcon 9 and Dragon. 

Now, there are new companies, such as FireFly Space Systems and Rocket Lab, that are building rockets that appear to be smaller versions of the Falcon 1. Rocket Lab's Electron Rocket is designed to carry 150kg to SSO and FireFly Alpha is designed to carry 200kg to SSO. The FireFly B will take 400 kg to LEO which puts it just behind the Falcon 1 in performance.

If the small payload market takes off do you think its possible that SpaceX will dust off the Falcon 1 design? Of course they will update it with the advancements learned from the F9 FT. An update Falcon 1 could be a Merlin 1D and Merlin 1D vac with both engines throttled down to conserve fuel or a scaled down Merlin. (The Meth/Lox aerospike engine for the Firefly B will have a higher Isp though.) The Falcon 1 was already delivering more then twice the payload of these rockets at $8.5 million in 2009. Electron Rocket will cost $4.9 million which will make the Falcon 1 cheaper per kilogram. 

If the market for low mass payloads into space expands greatly to accommodate the number of new companies will SpaceX reenter that market? On one hand they can probably produce a superior rocket in that price range but on the other hand its not really an advancement toward Mars like further F9 and FH development.",34,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/4kahq2/possibility_of_the_return_of_the_falcon_1/,0.9584,0.067,0.925,0.008
